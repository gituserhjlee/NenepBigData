I highly recommend it for mystery lovers, for anyone who wants to watch a good movie!"
1,"Knives Out is really a classic story of it's kind set in modern day with Daniel Craig even playing a very clear Hercule Poirot type character. There's a bit more humor and self-awareness than a lot of those classic stories, but never to the degree that it takes away from the twists and the mysteries. And there are some good twists. In fact one of the biggest mysteries is revealed midway through the movie which actually led me to check the time thinking ""damn, are we near the end already?"" but nope, they were just taking the movie on a left turn to Albuquerque that I did not anticipate and changed the course of the whole thing. Johnson has constructed a great mystery in the spirit of the classics. The fun of it too is how many twists there are without it ever feeling overdone. In that way also you can predict a few twists, but not another, so have fun feeling smart and still feel surprised by the others. It's just a classic fun film of its type."
2,"What an excellent film by Rian Johnson; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!"
3,"With the exception of my wife and daughter, and possibly my mother, Agatha Christie is the woman whom I love most on this planet. She truly was the most gifted and brilliant fiction writer who ever lived, and it rejoices me to see that her work still inspires other writers and filmmakers nowadays; more than forty years after she passed away. There are still many adaptations of her original work, but with ""Knives Out"", writer/director Rian Johnson attempts something entirely different. It's abundantly clear that Johnson was inspired by all of Christie's typical trademarks and hobby-horses, and he pays tribute to her most legendary characters and favorite settings, but the plot of ""Knives Out"" is entirely new and scripted directly for the screen. A good old-fashioned murder mystery/whodunit set in the enormous mansion of a wealthy family, full of eccentric people each of whom have dirty little secrets, convoluted plot twists, continuous red herrings that practically make it impossible to guess along, and a fabulous all-knowing but slightly odd sleuth slowly unravelling the clues.Daniel Craig is downright terrific as Benoit Blanc, a private detective with a bizarre accent and weird one-liners, hired by someone anonymous to dig deeper into the strange and sudden death of patriarch Harlan Thrombey. It looks like suicide, but literally every greedy member of Harlan's bloodline had a motive for killing and - also in delightful Agatha Christie tradition - the plot even thickens after the reading of the will. It would be a shame to reveal too much about the plot, but rest assured that is refreshing and inventive, compelling as well as humorous, complex but simultaneously light-headed and 200% entertaining. The cast is phenomenal. Craig clearly enjoyed depicting a heroic protagonist that is the complete opposite of his James Bond character, and the Thrombey family exclusively exists of great talents, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette, Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson. ""Knives Out"" is perhaps slightly too long, but never tedious, and very well-directed by Rian Johnson (who honestly doesn't deserve all this hatred from disappointed ""Star Wars"" geeks)"
4,"As a fan of mysteries (Sherlock Holmes, Poirot, Columbo, Monk, Psych.etc.) I was thrilled to see someone making a classic style whodunnit...and the cast! Figure you can't go wrong. Well I enjoyed it & while the cast all have time to shine it is Daniel Craig with his Southern drawl & especially Ana de Armas that steal the show. For anyone keeping away because they hated The Last Jedi...I agree, it was my least favourite of all the Star Wars films, but this is a well written film that was well acted and I can only hope this will inspire others to reinvigorate the murder mystery genre."
5,"I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut.Some people might hate the politics of it, but I thought it gave a good dig at both sides while still being fairly liberal. FOX watchers will hate it, which I can see as kind of fueling the negative reviews.What can also fuel the negative reviews. is all the positive hype about it. Too much enthusiasm from the critics can hurt a movie sometimes. Viewers go into the theater expecting too much.Things never live up to the hype and this one didn't live up to it for me. But I thought it was still pretty solid and entertaining. I'm not sorry I spent some money on this one."
6,"I have read the many glowing reviews for this film and I honestly don't get it. Yes, there were some very funny and entertaining parts. It was a very good ensemble cast. Daneil Craig does his best Kevin Spacey as Frank Underwood impression. But beyond that, I found the cast woefully underused. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson etc. I expected Jamie Lee to play a major role but she seemed more like window dressing. She also, as the daughter, appeared to have no real motive for the murder. So the real crime here was her underuse. 1/2 of the members of the family had no motive mentioned. Then, when the ""murder"" was revealed at the half way point, it was clear Martha did not really do it and was being set up. Chris Evans conveniently shows up at the halfway point with lines, so the reveal, for the most part is painfuly obvious, or at least most of it. The give-aways were pretty obvious, like granny saying ""Random, you're back AGAIN"" or the comment on how the dogs barked only with certain people. The mention of the ""slayer"" law was very, very obvious. I understand this is a parody of the sleuth genre but shouldn't there be at least some surprises?Nor do I believe this is a ""commentary"" on our situation today. Yes, there was a dialogue thrown in on immigration but nothing new was covered here.That is not to say it is a bad film. Daniel Craig and the cast seemed to be having a ball. Lots of kooky things happened. But I think this is better for a late-nite Netflix watch.I certainly don't see it as being ""best of the year."""
7,"I'm a mystery lover and have seen and read every Agatha Christie tale. I found this movie very slow for the first half. Second half picked up but again there was no deep mystery of whodunit, nor the charm and period atmosphere of a Poirot episode (which I can watch over and over - thank you David Suchet and the other main actors). The lead actress was very attractive, but the vomiting was definitely disgusting to watch, as well as ridiculously unbelievable (I guess that was the funny part?). Some of the characters had been under the sunlamp too many times or smoked way too often and looked weather-beaten. Did not like the sucking on cigars constantly. The last part was more entertaining and finally there was the rapid-fire conclusion thank the Lord. Agree that Daniel Craig with that southern accent was just super annoying. Great grandmother bored me after first moments of her being silent in an odd hat. Over and over. It moved pretty slowly for me at times. I guess I'm in a minority on this one. I'm not saying it was terrible but it was not a great movie for me."
8,"Generally speaking you tend to find more murder mystery TV shows than movies, this is partially since it's hard to build a complete mystery in the allotted movie running time.
This movie builds this murder beautifully by showing the different points of views of the suspects. It has a different take than other movies since it gives the viewer a little too much details mid-movie which leaves you questioning everything to the last minute.
The acting was brilliant and I didn't feel the number of characters was overdoing it at any stage."
9,"I saw the film a few months back and now that I noticed it is available for home watch decided to check the eating again, as at the time it was way too high in my opinion. I thought it would have gone down. It has not. Did I miss something spectacular about this film? Do I not have a sense of humor? I don't get it. It was ok. A bit slow. And absolutely nothing special. I think the ending was revealed too early and the twist was not suprising nor did I care about it. Weird."
10,"Being a middle aged Englishman I've been brought up on a diet of murder mystery stories and in many respects I've been spoilt. When the stories have translated from book to screen the production value is almost always secondary to the good conjunct story. I was very excited, having read the reviews, that seemingly in the case of 'Knives Out' I would be getting a rare trinity of a good story, good actors and good production. It certainly has two of the three. Unfortunately this film thinks it's cleverer than it is. It's simply a story of a privileged family and their pettiness with a rather trivial murder mystery chucked in as a contrivance to get them all together. Rian Johnson attempts to display the worst nature of the privileged minority with all the subtlety of a man screaming 'I am woke' at the top of his lungs at anybody who'll listen. Unfortunately subtlety and nuance are what makes for a good mystery story, you need to pay attention so as not to miss anything. With this film you could miss probably the middle third of the film and you'd not be any less aware of what's happening. A bit of a shame really."
11,Mildly entertaining with a great cast and high production value. The story is soft but not awful. I can't imagine saying this film deserves more than a 6.
12,"Knives out uses a really old idea, the ""whodunit"". Unfortunately, contrary to what many claim, there is not much here that makes it particular different or modern, except some hipster dialogue and humor (including a lot of throwing up by a specific character) and some commentary on current social issues, like the immigrant crisis, and pointing fingers at the ultra-rich, which is ironic because the writer/director of this movie is by now a multimillionaire and one of the highest paid directors in Hollywood. The writing is full of supposedly smart dialogue and ideas. In reality there not much cleverness here, while it constantly feels like the movie is trying too hard, and comes across as very pretentious and smugish. Most of the humor falls completely flat, it is overlong (130 minutes), twists are not surprising and don't really make sense. Only bright spots, Daniel Craig's amusing performance and the very talented Ana de Armas. Other than that, a semi-entertaining, mediocre and ultimate forgettable film. A perfect example of an uninspired writer/director, with a complete lack of originality, who uses a boring overused premise and accomplishes nothing new or interesting in the least.Personally I don't know much about Star Wars as I don't really follow pop-corn franchises, so I don't know what's going on with this director and Star Wars. However, it is very puzzling seeing this mediocre film which basically takes place in a house, getting so much marketing hype and buzz, while Hollywood seems to be in love with this movie and its' director. Looking around the internet for reviews and ratings one would think this is a serious Oscar contender for multiple awards, while some people are calling it the best movie of the year and calling out trolls (?) etc. I'm confused."
13,"I went into this film with high expectations to say the least. I had heard so many good things about it, so it was built up in my mind as this phenomenal murder mystery movie, but it fell short. Where do I begin? Daniel Craig has this southern accent that just does not come across as convincing, not annoying, but not convincing. The main character of the film, Marta, potrayed by Ana de Armas, has this very unbelievable physiological condition in which she vomits every time that she tells a lie. I mean, come on people. This vomiting 'tool' is used multiple times throughout the film to figure out the truth about some of the other characters in the story. Let's just say that she vomits excessively until the credits start to roll.Now, the part of this film that really upset me was the 'big reveal' at the end. It is revealed at the end that detective Benoit Blanc knew about the blood stain on Marta's shoe the whole time. The biggest issue with this reveal is why he didn't ask her about it. He would have known her involvment in the murder the whole time. Why didn't he get the blood spot on her shoe tested? That would have easily put her in the room with Harlan when he died.Overall, the movie was entertaining up until we are revealed what happened between Marta and Harlan. Once I found out how Harlan died, I started to lose interest. It basically lost the 'mystery' quality once that happened. The story went flat after that but then took off when new developments started to happen. The reason I give this movie a 6/10 is because I was able to figure out things about the story right away, which left me disappointed, and the blood spot made me question a majority of the movie. It wasn't a bad watch, but I don't think I will be watching it again."
14,"The movie is a ""meh"" but Mr. Craig's voice is just stupidily wrong...!"
15,"Knives Out (2019)
8/10🗡🚪💉💸""Rian Johnson successfully revives the ""whodunnit"" mystery subgenre with this perfectly cast fun time, even if it doesn't bring anything groundbreaking to the table.""Knives Out is the kind of ""whodunnit"" film that will never fail to entertain. As a progressive mystery, Knives Out is a very fashionable movie with it's grand ensemble of fresh and familiar faces. With some very snarky and slick writing, these characters are albeit memorable, most notably Daniel Craig's Detective Blanc and Chris Evan's Ransome, however, the film fails to make full use of the ensemble to the greatest extent. Of course that never takes away from what else Knives Out has to offer. The intensity of every moment that leaves you questioning the motive and action behind the titled crime scene is delivered with such glorious fashion, one could say Murder on the Orient Express had a beautiful baby, this being the result, showing Rian Johnson's strongholds. While the first two acts of the movie are quite strong and promising, the third act finds itself being a little rough around the edges but manages to find it's footing upon the conclusion; one for all and all for one.Verdict: Knives Out not only proves to us that Rian Johnson is a strong director with the right material, but also displays a fashionable reiteration of what the mystery genre can do to keep us guessing what is left in store for us to see in all the right ways."
16,"Others have mentioned the old house might have held some secrets (it didn't). Or that it might present a more structured ""Whodunit"" that leaves you guessing (it didn't). Or that the main character might offer a bit of verve, cleverness or pizazz, that might have livened up the whole affair (she doesn't, at all).I also take some issue with the director's choices in scene framing, especially in the beginning. There should have been more close-ups, and better initial intros for each character's little idiosyncrasies so we would could warm up to them. I simply don't care for how it was shot; it's terribly pedestrian. The fast, quick edits of the trailer are totally absent! There's something missing here. Todd Solondz, Tim Burton or the Cohen Brothers really could have drawn these characters out more and given the actors something real to work with.I thought it would sparkle with a bit more witty, dark humor. It wasn't quite as funny or snappy as I was expecting it to be. Instead, it settles on delivering more of a ""message"" about this girl, who does good, while the others do bad.There's also no need for Daniel Craig's poor Southern accent. He should have just done a British accent, it would have been fine and enjoyable, maybe given the film a bit more weight it seems it was shooting for, in the end, with its messaging.Additional viewings might reveal there's more to it, but I suspect such might reveal there's less."
17,"Have to say I was a little disappointed by this, not because it isn't good. Arguably it is, but no doubt because so many rave reviews suggested this would be outstandingly good, which it isn't. So as with so many films your experience & enjoyment will depend on the expectations you bring with you.Overall I think nearly everyone will enjoy this, particularly those who are tired of the standard fair of superhero movies or bloated CGI. Having said that while this is a far more intelligent kind of movie than the comparisons it is not entirely atypical of Hollywood. One of the good things or bad things about the movie depending on your point of view is the unstated but clearly evident political commentary beneath, but not always beneath, the surface and while this might add to your enjoyment if you like your bourgeois country house mysteries subtly subverted it's difficult not to be aware throughout that the politics on show is likely to inform the solution to the movie, which without giving too much away it ultimately does.What is genuinely enjoyable is Daniel Craig's slightly preposterous turn as a southern detective with an laid on thick accent to match. The rest of the cast features some big names, but unfortunately as others have pointed out they don't always have that much to do. Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette are pretty much wasted as arguably is Don Johnson.The Plot of course in any whodunnit is the biggest player of all, and while it's quite good, it isn't that good or that original. The key device upon which the solution depends is fairly basic and the solution may or may not be guessable (for the record I didn't work out who did it, but did work out the mechanism involved). If one compares this with mysteries that pose genuine conundrums and puzzlement Knives Out falls somewhat short. A part of the problem is that for much of the film it isn't clear how any crime could have taken place and for that reason one has to place trust in the story that a crime really has taken place. In the event we discover a crime did take place but given its virtual imperceptibility it never came across as in any way shocking or sinister.Perhaps the best aspect of the film, aside of Daniel Craig, was the fact that the Johnston achieves a quite nice balance between the comedy & the thriller aspects which actually makes this film a more pleasant experience than it might have been the case had it just been a straight up thriller. I'll probably be in the minority on this one but in that respect though I'd have to say I probably enjoyed Adam Sandler & Jennifer Aniston's Murder Mystery more than this, including with regard to the solution. Knives Out is the better film overall but not quite as good as it - or anyone else I'd venture - thinks it is. Still enjoyable though"
18,It was a very great movie I enjoyed watching it and of course it's one of the best movies in 2019
19,"I say it's nothing special and I'm not a Star Wars fanatic. I've never even seen the film people are so angry about, so my review is based purely on my experience of watching this film, Knives Out.I definitely expected more. If it's meant to be amusing, it pretty much failed on that score. This film would be better suited as a TV movie, if they even make them anymore, or something to pop up on Netflix. I didn't pay to see it and I'd feel I'd wasted my money if I had.Visually it was enjoyable-I mean the location, the house, the production values. the family members were an unattractive bunch, so nothing to look at there. Daniel Craig's ""southern"" accent became grating after awhile, and I was squirming a bit with boredom, waiting for it to be over. And, when it was, my reaction was ""So what? Who cares?"" I can hardly remember any of it and I just watched it in the last couple of hours.Convoluted, unrealistic and tedious, like a lot of Agatha Christie stories. How this has ended up on some people's Best Films of 2019 lists is beyond me. It was okay; nothing special."
20,"Good acting
Awful story
Social message was preachy and unnecessary
In my opinion it was a waste of a great location and
Intersting characters"
21,"I actually wish  would do away with the star-rating portion of their website because it doesn't give an accurate rating for films and this film is a perfect example. Everyone knows that there are many bitter Star Wars fanboys rating this film low because they are still so bitter over Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi and as a result, they are going to try to ruin any of Rian's future films. They really need to just get over it and get a life, already. DON'T believe the Star-Rating of This Film Because It's Mostly from Bitter Star Wars Fanboys Rating the Film LOW ON PURPOSE!, obviously. Anyone who has actually seen this film would be brain-dead to rate it low or to not give it a good review because this film is so freaking entertaining! I could see it again and again. It's so different than the crap that has been in the theaters lately. It's fun, it's thrilling, it's wacky, it has so many twists and turns that it always keeps you guessing. And for the cast, what a freaking cast! I couldn't even tell you who the MVP of the cast was. They were all fantastic. We need more films like this and less big explosions, stupid plot films. I for one, will give this the true star-rating it deserves! 10/10!!!!! Bitter Star Wars fanboys, you can keep being immature and rating it low, but it isn't going to change the fact that the film is great and I'm going to encourage every single person to go out and see it pronto when it hits theaters!"
22,"I wish I had something good to say about this. A bland script, dull characters, a totally miscast Daniel Craig with an awful Southern accent and you are in for a painful night at the cinema. If you love murder mysteries / whodunnits, you need to avoid this. It can't even decide if it's trying to be fun or serious. In the end it's neither."
23,"Good story with a creative and effective delivery. Very well written screenplay with all loose ends tied up together and reasonable foreshadowing and morals that echoes throughout, but there weren't any striking moments even to the point of final reveal, possibly due to the addition of yet more details approaching the end in an attempt to create a (slightly) forced satisfying end. Unnecessary characters and scenes that serve little to no purpose in the story other than for comedic effect were present, which maybe one of the reasons why audience may have a sense of emptyness when leaving the theatre. Nonetheless, Knives Out remains a fresh form of storytelling that is trying to achieve and convey more than your ordinary murder mystery."
24,"The idea of it mattering more what you do with the truth than the pursuit of it is a clever one, but instead of shining a light on prejudice, bias, and arrogance, it actually encourages all of these things in the audience by confirming all of those things in the end instead of destroying them.We're led to hate everyone who deserves hating right off the bat, and that never changes. What's worse, the people we're led to find innocuous only become more so as the story progresses. In short nobody grows and it ends up being a somewhat terrible mystery. It gets points for twists and turns, but none of those happen because of changes in the characters behavior or outlook. Johnston put all of the characters in their place from the get-go and never let them even wiggle slightly.The acting saves this movie. It is definitely worth watching just for the magnificent performances by everyone involved. It is just sad that they had to 'pay the pound' for Johnston's gross soapboxing, while the penny was the movie and mystery itself.It's interesting that there was an attempt to make fun of both SJWs and Nazis in this, while it so blatantly implied that rich entitled Americans are everything bad and illegal immigrants are everything good and hard-working. Such an unnecessary subtext in a murder mystery. especially considering it doesn't change throughout the movie...it's actually the one thing that's consistent."
25,"People say this is Rian Johnson's redemption? Yeah, he never needed any redeeming. But at least this movie is helping people to realize that he is a guy with talent, and prompting people to not only keep their eyes on him, but to also check out the films he made before The Last Jedi. Anyway, this was a wildly entertaining homage!There were several moments where this movie, dare I say, subverted my expectations.The cast is awesome!The acting is great! Especially from Ana de Armas, who had better get more work! And Daniel Craig! Let me tell you hearing Daniel Craig doing a southern American accent was very jarring at first. But I got used to it. And it helped with the tone of the movie!The tone and energy is a lot of fun!The dialogue is very well-written!Each character is distinct!The cinematography is great!The music helps with the tone and it's used at the right times!The comedy aspects were funny!There were subtle set-ups with payoffs that were very satisfying!And I love the title! It's fun!
There's some cheese but it's cheesy in the best way! Plus, since it's a homage the cheese doesn't hurt the movie.And there's a moment where Marta lies and doesn't puke. But I let it go pretty quickly.
It occurs to me that Rian Johnson excels at stories that are small in scale. Looper and Brick for example. Definitely one of my favorites of 2019. Go see it!"
26,"The movie plays like the worst episode of COLUMBO you have ever seen, only this time it features Daniel Craig attempting to imitate Foghorn Leghorn. Learn from my mistake and avoid this turkey."
27,"What a truly painful film. It felt like it was never going to end. I couldn't have cared less about any of the characters or how the old bloke died.Amateurish acting and Daniel Craig's accent was shockingly bad. I always thought he was a good actor but after this shambles I have changed my point of view.The film dragged on and on and on with very predictable twists here and there, but due to poor character development and as all were totally dislikeable why would we care. Obviously we are supposed to root for the nurse but whatever.Don't believe the hype with this. It's boring, close up face shots throughout which would be better for TV, cringeworthy lead from Craig and no dynamic direction or cinematography.I'll never get that time back or money.Pathetic."
28,"This has to be one of the most boring unoriginal films I've ever seen. I was so angry I felt like getting my money back. The plot was something a 10 year old could think up and the acting, if you can call it acting was so bad I thought i was watching a low budget improv schools last effort at acknowledement before it closes down. Daniel Craig's accent, what the hell was that supposed to be. They should all be very ashamed."
29,Really boring for the most time. Lots of wasted potential.
30,"For such a cast and an oscar nomination this film is too plain, boring and too much predictable."
31,"A Stella cast carrying a whodunit will depend entirely on the story... Sadly, instead of ""the plot thickens"", it thins out unbearably...Overall the movie was entertaining enough to watch... But the plot was stretched a little thin and the ending was disappointing...A whodunit works by bringing the audience along to try to figure out the crime and be pleasantly surprised at the big reveal... This movie decided at the half way point that it no longer wants to be a whodunit and we no longer should follow along as it does its own thing... Sigh...I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who truly enjoy the genre..Spoiler Alert...Let's tackle the minor annoyances first...1) The beginning sets everyone out as having a motive to murder... Standard for the genre but here, it stops there...No building up of everyone/anyone who also had the opportunity to commit the murder... Motive without opportunity doesn't add up to murder...This means... Before the middle of the story, we have already eliminated almost everyone as the suspect... Which kinda defeats the whodunit plotline...2) Having a girl who is a witness who vomits if she lies is extremely convenient for a murder detective... And... Surely any investigator will target her for as much information as possible...Here however, to preserve the big reveal later I guess, they let her off without ever really questioning her...(even Ransom got more information than the investigators did...)In fact, the detectives were more interested in talking to Benoit and kept telling her to go away after finding out this rather beneficial condition...This leaves a feeling of a weak plot that cannot exclude her from some crucial events...She didn't have to witness the suicide... Which in itself didn't add anything to the story... And with that, she could spill the beans on what she did and we can all still believe there was further foul play involved...3) Marta and Benoit find the hidden tox report after spending hours to chase it down... Yet they can sit down to have a chat after finding it but neither even opened it to take a look?This gives us the scene where she was about to confess in front of the whole family but was stopped in mid sentence... Drama!!!!That's ridiculous and again feels forced/false...4) Walt confronts Marta at her home... He evades the horde of reporters and came in via the back way...Firstly, a rich guy like him would likely never have to use the back way and wouldn't be able to find one...Secondly, Walt is the 'boss' of a printing empire and it's unreasonable that nobody in the media recognises him...Thirdly, he walks/limps with a cane...Is he really the best person to go seek Marta out under the circumstance?
Wouldn't Meg, Donna or Jacob be better suited for the stealth-required mission?5) Captain frigging America... Emm, I mean Ransom... When he left and came back, wouldn't that be recorded in the early part of the surveillance video? He stopped exactly where she stopped...Ok, this one, maybe I can accept the reason is he knows the area well and was able to evade detection... Still unsatisfying though...6) Fran wants to confront Ransom believing he killed Harlan...a woman, confronting a man/killer even if he's not Captain America, surely wouldn't choose an abandoned/creepy location to meet..What does she think will happen? This is not a slasher flick where dumb teenagers go into the room despite multiple warnings not to...7) Harlan was in a terrible rush to kill himself...Marta explained that he will die in
10 minutes... And at around the 5 minutes mark, he will sweat profusely and have some other symptoms...Wouldn't a normal person wait until the symptoms start to show before reaching for the knife?
Many more minor niggles like Benoit not needing to introduce himself before sitting inside the house witnessing all the 'interrogations'... -There seem to be no other maids or servants in such a huge, well maintained house, that needed to be questioned... -Marta just happens to have a large magnet in her pocket for erasing a video tape... -Nobody who wasn't around needs to have an alibi for their whereabouts...-none of the other detectives see the blood stain on Marta's shoe...Too many roll eyes moments for a whodunit plot...Now...Let's get to the parts that killed the movie/story...1) Benoit doing his best Poirot... And gave too much details without any evidence...Examples...-He could simply say Ransom switched the medication.. But instead, he goes into details of how he sucked out medication from one bottle and then from the other bottle... How would he know that?-How did he deduce that it was Ransom who sent him the cash?-How can he be so sure that a person with dementia simply didn't mix up 'back' and 'back again'... Very thin even if we can accept the inference...If he's wrong at any point, Ransom could stop him and the story telling ends...These plus some other details he brought up without any evidence shows that he is just showboating and not very professional... He should be more mindful of his reputation... And this goes against his persona of being careful with what he says as shown in the beginning...2) the claim is that Ransom torched the examiners' office the night before... And yet in the morning light (actually around 9am already...) and the fire on that not-large building seem to just get going... In real life, it should be ashes before daylight... Unless it was touched an hour or two before 9am...Since Ransom was with Marta in the morning, he couldn't have done it...3) we were told that overdose of morphine means dying in 10 minutes...When Marta found Fran, Ransom was in police custody and there was nobody else around... She should be the prime suspect...And obviously, Ransom couldn't have done that too...4) in the scene where she makes her escape after the will reading...the family couldn't stop her if she wanted to drive away... Richard said something like, what do you want me to do, bite the bumper?(to stop her leaving...)... But when she came out of the car, push through the crowd to get into Ransom's car, not a single person stopped her getting in...This is of course essential for her to spend quality time with Ransom... Totally unrealistic...In conclusion...As said... Not bad entertainment (6-7) but a terrible whodunit (2-3)... So around 4.5 overall..."
32,Beautifully filmed and thought out very well which to me is good enough! Great ensemble cast that did excellent acting among adding hilarious parts in many scenes. Absolutely love Daniel Craig and Ana De Amas did awesome! I'm sure Knives Out has mixed opinions but I am very glad I got to see an early screening.
33,"What fun must have been had by all, making this modern actors movie with deliberate fifties and eighties elements. And what fun for us viewers. It's always good news a film takes 2 hours and feels shorter watching it.
Ana de Armas - now meeting Daniel Craig as add-kicking bond girl, has a lot on her shoulders, playing the vulnerable nurse around whom hateful family member circle as ever so many vultures and lights up the scenes. More action heroes on holiday here: Chris Evans shows he is a character actor, effectively playing the nasty guy. I enjoyed Toni Collette as the hysteric one and Jamie Lee Curtis as Mrs. cool and collected. And what about Don Johnson as a clueless dad...
I've read about all Christie's work and so many elements are elegantly used. The mansion, the racketeers, the twisted family histories, even BBC 80's style the title role lettering... it's all there to enjoy
I'm not totally convinced of Daniel Craig's southern US accent - but the more the movie develops, the more he becomes a credible mix of Columbo and Hercule Poirot. Great timeless music score too."
34,"A stellar cast that could have been so much more it the plot had been good..
Daniel Craigs Frank Underwood/Kevin Spacey imitation is no imitation, it is beyond bad, and makes you actually cringe... Besides bad it is not even consistent.., he forgets to try and uses british from time to time and it is awful...To save your time..., Captain America did it and the nurse gets it all.."
35,"A joy to watch from start to finish. Excellently filmed and very clever. The cast all hit the mark. Charismatic Daniel Craig shines throughout. Even Chris Evans shows he can be much more, or maybe less like Captain America than ever. Murder mystery's don't get much better than this.I admit I was a skeptic, given my distaste for Johnson's Last Jedi. But I was pleasantly surprised from the get go. The script is smart and captivating. So kudos to you Mr. Johnson for a well written and directed piece of cinema. I will watch your next film with anticipation."
36,"I have no idea how this rating is so high. I assume it's only because of the star studded cast but what a ridiculous storyline. Murder Mystery is the exact same concept and it's a much better watch. A housekeeper who vomits every time she lies gets the inheritance of the man she's working for. There's such forced dialogue about politics that have nothing to do with the storyline, the ""Nazi troll"" bit was just unnecessary, and I say that as liberal black woman. It was just Incredibly disingenuous and patronising even. The whole storyline and reveal was just underwhelming and the obvious twist was basic.
How incredibly disappointing and such a waste of my time, I feel for anyone who paid to watch this. Do not make another one."
37,"This film clearly considers itself to be very clever (& classy).
It is at least fairly well mannered.
Clever? No.
A decent episode of Columbo or Poirot(Suchet) is far more satisfying.
I was glad when it finished. There's no depth to this. Kermode thinks it's a work of genius. It isn't. Was Daniel Craig impressive? No, not really.
Was anything else impressive? Not at all.
A decent cast which delivers almost nothing.
A work of no obvious merit that's totally overblown."
38,"Sometimes I am shocked when I see a great film...only to see it has an incredibly low overall score on IMDB. This is definitely the case with ""Knives Out""....a great film by writer/director Rian Johnson that I strongly recommend you see. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if this one receives some Oscar nominations...it's that good.""Knives Out"" is like an Agatha Christie novel set in modern day America and with American characters. But it's not just a homage to Christie-style films but a genuinely good and unique film in its own right. Kudos to many of the actors...particularly Daniel Craig. I thought Craig was miscast as a Southern American detective....but he carried it off wonderfully.Overall, I have no complaints...nothing I disliked or would do differently. In fact, it was so good I nearly gave it a 10....and I completely enjoyed the movie."
39,"Obviously this film has a sophisticated marketing strategy - nothing else would explain the high ratings it gets. I was looking forward to it but unfortunately it's just boring and dull. You'll find more charisma and excitement in a daytime soap. Ana de Armas is the only actor worth watching, while the film exposes the limitations of Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this."
40,"GENERAL REVIEW
Going in, I was expecting an energetic Edgar Wright feel, and complex Sherlock Holmes mystery in which the audience tries to solve it at the same time. What I got was a cookie cutter 'mystery' that was different from others in its genre only in its use of bright colours, rather than any sort of trope and convention subversion or parody.SPOILER TIMEIn regards to acting, Christopher Plummer, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans gave great performances. 0 complaints for the main 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Harlan and Marta's scenes. There are more than 3 members of the cast, of which I have complaints; Jamie Lee Curtis and Micheal Shannon among others gave performances that seemed to change personalities every few lines, probably due to Rian Johnson's directing. Don Johnson was good, LaKeith Stanfield was not, others were mediocre or just less.
Special Daniel Craig section. Daniel Daniel Daniel. What was that. The screenplay reads ""Blanc ... speaks in the gentlest southern lilt you have ever heard in your life."" That is not what I was forced to listen to. The accent was very distracting and I could only hope for a case of Stockholm syndrome that never came. His character was meant to act as an absurdist archetype satire of the noir detective, but instead he came across as an annoying detective who did not diverge from the archetypal role. If that didn't bother you then it would have been a good performanceAs mentioned I was expecting more Edgar Wright-esque editing and cinematography that the trailer promised me.Overall, the writing is very basic, being a typical murder mystery. I am unsure if you can even call it a murder mystery when you find out the truth a quarter through. Throughout the story, there were many setups with minimal or no payoff, e.g. shoe blood, where is Marta from (Harlan should have commented to Ransom during their fight where she is from). There were also too many inconsistencies, like how the stairs did not actually make a noise every time, some people went up with a noise and down without because Rian Johnson forgot.
For the final reveal; Marta must be especially talented to feel ""tincture and viscosity"" of vials, a quality you might be able to feel when you are drawing a syringe, but she had made the choice already which solution to use, maybe density or weight would be acceptable but the given explanation of her being such a good person that her vail choice was correct is pretty dumb. Also, the shots for Fran's last words were different, where she said ""you did this"" in the scene and first flashback, but ""Hugh did this"" in the last. These 2 issues detract from the fun of watching murder mysteries, in which an audience should be able to find the killer if they have been paying attention, instead the script pretended like you should have known these facts.
The suspect game instead was played by cast knowledge. By looking at the cast you can see it's either Jamie Lee Curtis, Micheal Shannon or Chris Evans, personally I guessed Micheal Shannon due to his typecasting, but when I realised that all 3 of Harlan's children where the same character, with different jobs, it was then obviously the built up character named Ransom. Ransom. His name is Ransom.This leads me to one of my main critiques: Unnecessary characters. Despite all 3 of Harlan's children being the same, the ""nazi kid"" served 1 purpose that could have easily been delivered by another character, the granddaughter, Katherine Langford served a whopping 2 purposes that all together could have been dropped and exchanged. There were 2 cops and Blanc for some reason, of which the comedic policeman was not funny.Lastly, too many convenient devices like the stairs that made a noise 'every time', Marta vomiting when she lies, the dogs choosing to like and dislike people, or the various murder mystery cliches that excuse themselves through being self aware (secret doors and prop knives)"
41,"I really wanted to like this film. I love whodunit films, from Agatha Christie to Murder She Wrote, the intrigue and mystery of this sub-genre can be very interesting and entertaining in the right hands. Yet here, with this film, none of the intrigue or mystery is either interesting nor entertaining, and like the awful humour, misses its mark! I like puzzles that hint at me, not hit me over the nose, and 'Knives Out' is a poor man's murder mystery - a very easy 1 out of 10."
42,"Absolutely disgraceful, good for the first 40 minutes but takes a quick downhill slide into a script that might have been written by a 5 year old. The usual happy bs ending of course; no intensity or twists left me feeling robbed of my time of life. Even my son could've finished off this story with a more thrilling and jaw dropping twist."
43,"Great movie that really does have all the hallmarks of the classic murder mystery. The story is fairly typical, there is a shocking death, everyone has their motives, and piece by piece the truth is pulled together by a sleuth, in this case Benoit Blanc (great name), who comes across as a more modern version of Hercule Poirot.To discuss the story, is to give away the twists and turns it takes, which are delightful. Tension is maintained really well throughout the film as you constantly try to guess and workout where this mystery is going, and even right at the end the twist that comes doesn't do anything to release that tension until literally the last 1min of the movie.The real joy though is in an all star A-list cast all performing at the top of their game, and working so well together. In many cases playing against type which is a joy to watch. If you're a fan of murder mystery, then this is a much watch!"
44,Knives Out started very funny. The first half of the movie is in my Oppinion great. Good character development and great plot development. However the second half of the movie was weaker in both of these aspects. I wish the family would have been more involved into the second half.Overall I would definitely recommend to watch Knives Out!
45,"Love Jamie Lee Curtis! Bow down to the queen. Whoever thought this odd cast would just work so well but they do. The best scene is when they are all crying while the will is being read trying to act as if they are so distraught while counting the dollar signs in their heads. It does, at times, get a little too into the woke culture were in but at the same time pokes fun at those people who are rich but act as if they understand the struggle. Good comedy and good movie. This movie is just a little gem and is definently worth watching."
46,"Honestly, I saw Toni and HAD to watch it. I went to the movies, which is a HUGE deal because I watch ALL my movies for free either from this one website, Netflix, or Tubi. Anyways, it WAS long but kept my attention all the way through. The story of a family and their greed. I loved it"
47,Worth a watch. It's a good mystery movie and will keep you hooked till the end.
48,This is truly a good story and not just common mystery.
49,A classic whodunnit.Sure you can guess who but it doesn't spoil from the how and why.
50,"A fun, enjoyable ride. Satisfying cinema.Daniel Craig is great, nice to see a bit of range from Bond.I fully recommend this for a good old fashioned Movie, pizza and popcorn night."
51,"I was so hyped for this movie after seeing the star studded cast and the rave reviews online. A movie with Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Jamie Lee Curtis, I couldn't ask for more. However, the pacing is slow and the ""big twist"" is quite underwhelming. The jokes fall flat and aren't done well, I was expecting some great thrilling mystery and bust out laughing jokes but it sadly was a dud."
52,"Not satisfied with butchering Star Wars, Rian Johnson sets out to do a poor man's ripoff of the films of Jonathan Lynn like Clue and Greedy. The script is pretentious, trying way too hard to be clever, and is about as subtle as a sledge hammer to the face, the actors do the best they can with a dreadful script, but it's all around a waste of time that will only be enjoyed by hipsters.Anyone who creates a character to mock their critics is clearly too immature to be directing films. Stop giving this hack work and do not waste your time on this drivel."
53,Not sure how this film has managed to get anywhere near to an 8 - it is a very dull film that thinks it is cleverer than it actually is! Not a case of Whodunit but more like Whocares.
54,"Another movie about whites being awful and the Rick grandfather giving all his money to the nurse/caretaker and immigrant mother.
It was offensive and crap.
White hate is everywhere.
Disgusting and racistThe millionaire granddaddy left everything to his Brazilian caretaker and her undocumented mother.
I went to go see a good movie, it's now impossible.
All politics and brainwashing.
I'm honestly disgusted
They even mentioned nazis and snowflakes and the family argued.
I was honestly taken aback
Horrible movie.
All trying to subliminally tell Rick white men who are dying to leave their fortune to NOT atheist deserving families, but undocumented immigrants"
55,"The director wants to prove that he is clever so badly, but there are so many plotholes it is glaringly obvious to anyone with an IQ above 50..."
56,Boring is the day is long. Wanted to leave the theater but my sister liked it. Seemed to go on forever. Also full of woke SJW agenda pushing. Good acting.
57,"The shills are out in force for this , frankly forgettable, movie. There seems to be a constant stream of 10/10 reviews which read as though the poster hasn't even seen the film.
The film looks good but the plot and character motivations don't make much sense in the face of anything other than casual scrutiny.
That said I did enjoy the first act. If the rest of the film had continued in that tone it would have undoubtedly earned a higher score for me.
The second act is very pedestrian and drags,but the film falls apart in the denouement.
Has zero rewatch potential. Wait for it on TV or streaming."
58,"This isn't even a ""who dunnitt"" murder mystery. An old man commits suicide in plain view of the audience so we know right away ""who dunnit"". The rest of the movie consists of watching a hispanic nurse vomit every fifteen minutes while the victim's family do nothing but spew vulgarity at each other. Should've stayed home and played with my dog instead of wasting my time at this one."
59,"This movie has arguably the worst writing I've ever experienced. I was incredibly excited to see it for months. I tried to stay away from excessively watching trailers or reviews to come in with as little of an expectation as I could. Which for me was hard. I adore the entire cast, I have thoroughly enjoyed some of Rian Johnson's earlier work (Star Wars excluded), and I got caught up in the nostalgia of a thrilling ""whodunnit"". Upon seeing it, I was very quickly shocked by the lack of originality, the completely cheesy dialogue, and a horrendous and obvious plot. I have never walked out of a theater in my life but this is the closest that I've ever come. I openly laughed at how bad the dialogue and plot points were. The entire theater was silent except to grimace. Don't waste your time or your hopes."
60,"I want to start by saying that I live for crime mysteries so I am 100% in the target audience. I'm quite familiar with the genre and I love everything in it by default.However, this movie had too many flaws and I can't understand how it has such a high score. My only guess is that most of the people who voted are incredibly unfamiliar with the genre and don't have a reference point.Anyway, let's get to the chase. For a crime mystery it's incredibly important to get the audience to ask the right questions. There have to be very few very clear and interesting questions. And this is the most important thing the movie does not get right. The questions change all the time, they are too many, they are unclear, too simple, some too easy to figure out anyway. And we have this issue both in regards to the plot and to the characters. So the mystery part is done incredibly poorly.The crime part is almost OK but a lot of the time it's all over the place. We didn't get a proper view of the picture in regards to the crime that took place. What exactly was done and how, what the police see as being suspicious and why, dissection of the motives of the characters and, you know, and actual investigation. It would have been fine if it wasn't such a crucial part of the story and if at least the mystery or the drama was very good.So, next on the list is the drama. This is the only genre that actually has something to offer here. Trying to work with the characters' differences in moral stances and ethics was a very good idea, unfortunately this part of the script was in embryonic state. I believe that if they went with that as their main guiding line and main genre the movie could have been very good.Lastly, if you go in expecting comedy... I hope you will be able to see any. It is beyond me how this is even listed as a genre here. The movie is light and easy to digest but that's not really comedy.Other general notes:1. Casting was fine but I have no idea what they were even trying to do with the Daniel Craig character. In the beginning I needed quite some time just to get used to him and for the rest of the movie he was below average. I admit, I truly can't even guess their intentions there. Other than that I found the casting and acting to be enjoyable.2. I found the music to be just as messy as the story and the mix of genres. I am sympathetic because it must have been really difficult to figure out what the movie is supposed to be and therefore how to make the soundtrack.3. I would really like to say something good or that I would recommend it anyway to people who haven't seen anything of the genre at least, unfortunately I just can't do that. It felt undercooked and messy. I would not watch any sequels they decide to make. Any British crime movie or TV show is a hundred times better in all aspects so why waste my time.I hope this is not where detective movies are headed. First Kenneth Branagh and now this... There are plenty of people who know how to make these movies right, just give them a chance, Hollywood!"
61,This is comparable to a Colombo or Murder She Wrote but with an all star cast of no memorable performances and a typically wooden turn by Craig. How this movie was green lighted beggars belief but if you're drunk with two hours to fill then it may be just the ticket.
62,"Saw this with a friend at an advance screening, so at least we didn't have to pay for it. This film felt like it was trying oh so hard to be ""fun"" and ""hip"" but ended up falling flat. The plot gets convoluted, and confusing at times. The device of having Ana de Armas' character vomit when she lies was pretty dumb. At two hours and 10 minutes, it's at least 45 minutes too long. It wasn't awful (if it was, we would've left), but left us both feeling ""meh."" It was fun watching the actors wolfing down the scenery, and so was not too unpleasant way of passing the time. But this isn't a movie I'd recommend to anyone."
63,"I felt like Daniel Craig was supposed to take the place of the excommunicated Kevin Spacey. What a stupid accent for Craig.
Overall, meh...Pretty boring. Not sure who's watching this movie and saying it's great. Their bar must be set pretty low."
64,I kept wondering why we were watching. The idea was interesting but didn't allow for the viewer to watch more than snippets of action at a time. It's was a study in 'tell don't show' expository and if anything happened at all it must have happened at the end. I couldn't make it through more than an hour and was surprised there was an hour more to go when I hit stop. Knives Out is a poor attempt at dark comedy thriller that was sold to the masses via celebrity stunt casting and beautiful cinematography and color grading. It may look like something more than Hollywood popcorn fluff but it isn't. This movie will be forgotten as soon as the next one in its genre is released.
65,"Knives Out is an incredibly complex whodunit that skillfully subverts expectations, switches between multiple genres easily and effectively and only gets better with multiple viewings. It's also surprisingly extremely funny and expertly paced. All of it's incredible cast are excellent but Chris Evans, Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas give the standout performances. Rian Johnson's direction is incredible and the film is extremely well filmed. The music by Nathan Johnson is fantastic."
66,"As of writing this on 11/30/19, this movie has over an 8 rating....and that is just BAFFLING. It tries so hard to surprise and shock, yet none of the twists are surprising nor shocking. Movie's with over an 8 on IMDB are reserved for the upper echelon, the absolute best of the best. This, being generous, deserves a 6 out of 10 (I'd rank it at a 4 out of 10). The only reason I can see it getting more is because people want to see themselves as artsy and cinematic experts. It's a bland murder mystery with a good cast that is WAY too long and never delivers on any front."
67,"Within the first 20mins I guessed the ending. Then it felt like absolutely nothing happens in the middle. The best jokes are in the last 10mins, and they definitely aren't worth it. The writing reminded me of an aspiring 20 year old who only wished they could write something interesting but doesn't have the life experience yet. Very disappointed in this shabby story."
68,"This is a poorly done Hollywood rip off of an Agatha Christie story. For the ""who-done-it"" genre, there is a certain format that you're supposed adhere to that you save all your reveals until the end, but in this film, they show the reveals right after they set them up in the first act. However, what do you expect from a Hollywood film that panders to idiot Americans that need to be spoon fed every plot point in a film."
69,"I have no problems with the plot, even though it is overly simplified to the point of cartoonish as many have pointed out.I have a problem with the character Marta. For a character that is supposed to be the ideal ""good"" she is certainly not and Rian Johnson does not understand what ""good"" is. An entirely ""good"" character would have to do good to be considered even close to being good. Marta does nothing of the sort. She plays the game Harlan's way (no matter what Blanc says), she tries to do everything the way Harlan wants even though she knows what she is doing is wrong and that is not the doings of a ""good person."" Her character is supposed to be an angel who is the only truthful person around, who can't even lie without puking. But, she does lie and hide her puking. She also actively, willingly hides the truth till the end. If she were a perfectly good character, then she would not have hidden the truth, going to great lengths.The writer does not understand that there is no difference between actively hiding the truth and lying. Marta is a selfish person who looks for her or her family's benefit. If there is self-interest, there can be no ""good."" If there is ""good,"" there can be no self-interest. There is no difference between the Thrombey's looking out for their own and Marta looking out for her own. If one should be considered ""bad"" than the other is as well. And this is the case. This is why screenwriters should seek help from advisors of ethics when they try to write stories that make judgements about such subjects."
70,One of the most boring films I have ever watched. Unbelievable characters and so unrealistic.
71,"Hugely overrated. Great respect to Dan Craig, but he was completely miscast, and his accent is embarrassing. And then there's the plot. Erm... Why would Harlan kill himself 'knowing' the post-mortem' would indict Marta? And why not wait until some signs of the assumed morphine OD kick in. And who kills themselves by slitting their throat? And then there's the two redundant cops who don't have a problem with Blanc doing their job for them, who further overcrowd an already overcrowded 'stage'."
72,"The best bits of this film are the first 10 minutes and the last 10 minutes.. the ending is cliché.. nothing we've not seen before.. 'lead actress takes phone call from hospital and subsequently tricks killer into confession, then informs killer that his last victim has regained consciousness and is willing to give a statement.. meanwhile witnesses/cops hear killers confession while having their phone on 'record' to capture said confession.. but then informs killer that the victim had actually died but by then it's already to late..' It goes on way to long, it's a poor adaptation of the film 'Clue'As performances go, Daniel Craig with his dodgy southern American accent is bad.. stick to James Bond..Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette came out tops in this in my opinion.. they normally always perform well..Katherine Langford is so wooden and reads a script like it's just been handed to her and and comes across like a cardboard cut out.. (nothing has shone from her since Season 1 of the dreadful show, 13 Reasons Why, and that's the only reason she's here riding off the fame of that one season as Season 2 is trash)It's also a shame you don't see enough of Christopher Plummer as he's the star performer in this film..But to many stars and not enough screen time for the best of them..Believe it or not I wanted to like this film.. it's done well at the box office, decent reviews, took the money but I think I expected to much, it's way overhyped and nothing you've not seen before.."
73,Let me ask you this. You ask some very good actors to be in your movie and then you give them nothing to do. That is the problem with this movie. All the famous actor have nothing to do and their part are very small. The so called murder you figured it out in less then 10 minutes. And Craig accent sucks badly. It's very hard to listen to him. I could not wait for this movie to end I was ready to leave after 10 minutes into it. Wow boring.
74,"Knives out has to be the shallowest stupidest movie ever made. They just want to ca$h in on holiday money. Terrible plot, bad acting, but what do you expect with a dumb whodunit."
75,"""Knives Out"" is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, ""Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense"". For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating). It's fun enough, the kind of film best watched after Christmas lunch with the family, but it's not a game-changer in any way."
76,Mildly interesting plot. Could not move pass the in-your-face political agenda
77,"Pretty alright mystery, hard to ignore alot of social commentary. Pretty standard set up a wealthy conservative family and make them seem like the worst people in the world type of deal"
78,"Why defenders of this film can't understand simple fact: people JUST get tired from unnecessary POLITICS in EVERY mediocre entertaining film. And this guy have his 1/10 not for Last Jedi, but for this cheap political pamphlet with direct offense to American majority, like we don't have already infamous Red Hollywood, and now they go again. I am from country with socialistic regime and this rhetorics will lead only to oppression of some classes. And then! I am telling this about that detective movie? YES! Its real shame that in 2019 we can't go to movie theater and don't get bunch of political statements in our faces. Maybe ratings of this film make them producers think that short-term cash-grab on liberal zoomers is really short-term. Or maybe we will get somedays some MPAA film rating system that include POLITICS in film and get for that R. Because they deserve it for propaganda to the children. Maybe I see the day when all Disney fosterling get their R-rating for propaganda and strong political themes."
79,I wasted an afternoon watching this because I had to kill some time and it was the only show in the time window I had. I didn't like it at all. The wildly improbable plot (a girl who pukes if she tells a lie? really?) was comical.
80,"A pretty bland whodunit that think's it's more intelligent than it is. A good whodunit needs a twist, or a surprise at the end, this had neither, the person you presume is the bad guy at the beginning is the bad guy at the end. In the films defence, the cast are all excellent"
81,It felt like it was 10 hours long! So slow and boring I couldn't wait for it to finish!
82,"I like a good mistery and this one is fun to watch. A quite long movie, but it has a good combination of comedy, mistery and even though it involves a crime it doesn´t appeal to violence or polemic topics."
83,"Perfect Mix of corn, sleuthing and comedy, acting was on par for a murder mystery and my only real complaint are some minor plot holes. It's a good movie."
84,"You need a brain to watch this movie. All the screen play of Prairo and Agatha Christie murder mystery end with the final reveal.... this is a little different. The revals and twists start coming about half way, after the character development, you think you know... but you do not... a joy to watch.. but not full rating because of the large list of suspects in the family and there is a lot to take in..."
85,Had a fun time watching it. Good actors and interesting plot.
86,"A lovely - if at the end somewhat deus-ex-machina a bit too convoluted - humorous take on the classic detective story, with winking eye humour sprinkled in, and superb performances by a fantastic cast.
Very enjoyable!"
87,"Knives Out is a 2019 film directed by Rian Johnson and starring Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas.
I absolutely adored this film, it was fantastic!
Possibly even my personal favourite film of last year, even though I don't think it's the best.
The cast is probably the best part of the film, Craig and Evans in particular are very good but I also really liked Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette and of course Christopher Plummer although I would say that Jaeden Martell diserved a bigger roll, he was pretty good on 2017's It.
The story is incredibly interesting with great twists however I was sadly spoiled by a tumbnail of a Youtube video so I already knew the ending ):
Finnaly I also really liked the set design, as Detective Elliot puts it: ""The guy basically lives in a Cluedo board"".
9.2/10"
88,Such a fun movie. It's nice to see a good old-fashioned mystery.
89,"Great cast, great acting, great directing and great (although not very realistic) characters. Fun plot that keeps your attention all the way through. I was hoping for a different ending. {SPOILER ALERT: Part of me hoped it was all a game and that Harlan was still alive and just trying to decide who deserves his inheritance. The ending is still good but it's kinda sad that he killed himself for no reason}.
Anyways, If you don't take it too seriously, you'll enjoy it. Thumbs up."
90,"Having quality actors and good critical reception, I thought this movie will be fun, so I watched it with my mom, as we love those ""Clue/Cluedo"" style comedy movies. I expected a comedy about weird characters in a mansion trying to solve a murder. Sadly, movie takes a different turn, innovates and changes the old formula of movie like this. This is sad not because of the sole fact that the formula is changed, but because the movie felt really long and boring. It's ending is fun, but... Yeah... This is actually just a classic crime movie, with a few humorous moments. And nothing else. Having in mind the great cast, I expected so much more from this movie and can't help but to fell really disappointed. It could have been so much more! Eh... It's not a bad movie.... It's an OK movie... But not a great one for sure. 6.5/10! It can still be fun and give you a few laughs, but don't expect too much, because you simply won't find it here..."
91,It's a mystery to me why this movie got so many good reviews. The acting is fine but the story isn't anything exceptional and is very slow moving. Add in social commentary that is so out of place that it distracts even more from an already marginal story. But I guess that's the movie business today.
92,"What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. It's hard to believe that this is the same writer/director as Brick, which is one of my top 10 favorite movies. This movie doesn't have nearly as much sly humor as that movie. It's not particularly witty and it's not really a sendup of the genre, either. Not a complete waste of time, but not what I was hoping for either."
93,"There's no point in labeling a movie as a murder mystery when there is literally no murder...or mystery. We find out what happened near the beginning of the movie and for the rest of it just follow some random character. It's boring, lazy and sloppy and just proves that Rian Johnson needs to take a break from directing for some time"
94,"I can't believe I wasted my life watching this terrible film. It was poorly executed and filled with hollywood elitist BS. Really politically motivated and nauseating. If you don't saddle right up with the hollywood elite and their ideology, prepare to have it shoved down your throat. The mystery part was weak and boring. Not at all worth your time"
95,"This movie feels like a teenager made it. It has underwhelming oohs and aahs that kind of make you cringe. Daniel Craig with and Arkansas accent doesn't help. The "" mystery"" was solved in the first 5 minutes and we were hoping for a surprise ending but just got what we figured."
96,"One of the most borring movies I have ever seen. Despite top actors and a really good performance from all the actors, the movie lacks plot, and you find yourself knowing who the killer and the weak plot within the first hour, which leaves the movie in one long tedious dialog between all the characters. Can not recommend."
97,"Why all the praise for a poorly written, over-acted, pretentious comedy that has nothing going for it except a few good lines. Far too long. Far too many dead scenes. Far too many jokes that don't work. Save yourself two dull hours and watch something, anything else. Seriously."
98,Some people love it some people don't. I don't. Found myself embarrassed for the actors and lack of writing.
99,"Knives Out (4.5 out of 5 stars).Knives Out is a mystery murder crime film which you will have a lot of fun with this Clue like concept as Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to solve a murder. This kind of film reminds me like Murder at the Orient Express. But a little more fun and entertaining. Rian Johnson direction and his witty script makes this movie worth watching. It is fun, there are surprises, and twist and turns.The plot follows Harlan (Christopher Plummer) who is a patriarch and owns a lot. After he was mysteriously found dead and presumed it was a suicide. A private investigator Benoit Blanc is hired to solve the mystery. With the family being on the will and are wanting their share of Harlan's property and company. Blanc believes there is a suspect that is at large within the family.The film's plot is a little slow moving. It is a lot of fun. Blanc interviewing every family member Ranson (Chris Evans) who is the black sheep of the family. Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her husband Richard (Don Johnson). Walt (Michael Shannon). Meg (Katherine Langford). Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Joni (Toni Collette). And their house nanny Marta (Ana de Armas). The cast ensemble was great. The performances are fun and entertaining.The film is filled with surprises with twist and turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it. I would love to see another movie of this.Overall, Knives Out is a really good film. If you are into the murder mystery kind of movie. This would be it."
100,"You can't go to the movies anymore. Everything is just junk propaganda.In this one, the migrant inherits everything, because has a kind heart and from a higher stage is going to cast judgement upon the unworthy, wasteful.
The End."
101,It was a little boring and too long. Great cast but I don't see why it deserves all this acclaim.
102,It's a fun whodunit movie with a great cast. It would make a great book too.
103,"It is a beautiful and well acted movie. But this type of film is not my cup of tea. They managed to not make it feel too ""theatrical"" but still I felt that the characters were a bit ""plastic"" and the plot - ""who did it?"" - is not something I am terribly interested in."
104,"After having seen all of Johnson's movies except for The Brothers Bloom I expected something a little bit more from Knives Out. A more mature, cold film with it's tounge in cheek is what I wanted after previously enjoying Brick and Looper so much. I was at least very happy to see it put a curious twist on the murder mystery genre. The story takes a very different path than I expected. Sadly, it seems as though they could have gone in harder with this twist, it goes back to the usual motions after a while.As it is this has to be Johnson's most accessible movie yet. It's a star-studded cast filled with old reliabales and also some newcomers. Though I don't feel as though the actors were given very much time to properly shine it's all very lovely and nice. The high saturation and crazy colorful sets should grab the interest of most viewers aswell, though I do find the cinematography quite formulaic.If you're looking for a nice family film you can take your children or parents to you're sure to have a blast. If you're looking for anything like Johnson's earlier work or something more artsy however, you'll be disappointed."
105,"And amazing movie.The plot is wonderfully designed. The cast is excellent. If you are in search for a great movie 2019/2020, in the genre crime or thriller, this is the right option for you. Ranks for me in line with ""the bone collector"" or ""the firm"".A family tragedy with a private detective a la Columbo, a housekeeper that cannot lie, a heritage that not a single member of the family deserves and ... see it yourself.10/10 recommendation: enjoy."
106,"It's a good movie, completely different twist. But it's impossible to fully enjoy as you are getting left wing lectured from the opening scene until the end."
107,I thought it would be a witty dark mystery about Daniel Graig as a PI who solves a murder mystery in a mansion. But was wrong. The film has almost no mystery. Much of it takes place outside of the mansion. It focuses almost entirely on a hispanic maid in order to make a painfully obvious political statement about how entitled white people mistreat immigrants. That's it. That's the whole film. There aren't reversals more than props planted and then hinted at later. Plot convenience and terrible writing. The film doesn't even make sense. This felt like a bad draft. My head hurts now.
108,"Smarmy, arrogant, condescending, and not anything close to being as clever as this film *thinks* it is. You know within 5 minutes, another movie made by a demorat elitist. Some decent performances to be found, hence the 3 stars. Some actors highly under used (lookin at you, Chris Evans). I would say it's mostly a waste of time. It's plots don't twist. The 'whodunit' factor never really comes into play. And when the movies reaches it's climax, like most women who date weak willed, vegan men....you're left thinking, ""is that it?"" as you wonder off to the bathroom, alone, to finish what was started. My advice? Skip it and save yourself the disappointment."
109,"This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review of a movie on IMDB. I was excited to go to this the day after Thanksgiving on the rare day off. When I say it was a real drag it's because the pacing was horrible absolutely boring at times you've been a somewhat strong finish couldn't help it, it was so predictable. A fine cast couldn't save it. Watch Murder on the Orient Express instead."
110,"I love mystery stories. I adore Daniel Craig. The writer of this mess, not so much. Don't understand why it is so overrated. Ooohh, big surprise ending. By the time he gets around to it, don't much care. Why bother to make Craig assume the bad accent as it adds absolutely nothing to the plot or character. I've read so many better books, why not make movies out of them. Read Nesbo, see Headhunters. Now That has plot twists."
111,"If you seriously think the ending has an unpredicted twist you are mentally challenged.
If you wanna watch brilliant detective who did it turn to Poirot and Miss Marple.
My God, this movie sucked."
112,"The acting was excellent with a cast the worked well together. The plot was very good for a whodunnit with only a couple of holes. It is like someone gave them a good script and were then told to insert the Hollywood viewpoint. The script would have worked just as well without it. After the first fifteen minutes you know who the good guys are, who the bad guys are and basically how the movie is going to end all because of the politics that have needlessly put into the movie. Some scenes seem like they are cracking an egg with a sledge hammer If I want to listen to someones politics I will watch a political show or go to a political meeting or even a movie that is supposed to be political.I was really looking forward to seeing the movie and left hugely disappointed."
113,"I love who done it movies, but this one bored me. Daniel Craig had no presence and his fake southern accent was insulting.Not worth bothering with. I wonder how many of the 10 star reviews are from the people that worked on the movie."
114,"The first 30 minutes of this movie were really, really good. The cinematography is gorgeous, the dialogue snappy, the editing engaging. But it all fell apart once the first twist is revealed and Rian Johnson starts getting self indulgent.I really don't like that he likes to have meta lines about how stupid his writing decisions are as if that justifies them. For example, we get the most borning car chase in cinema and when it's over one character says ""that has to be the dumbest car chase I've ever seen"". Seriously, I'm not even kidding. The detective sounds like a Foghorn Leghorn parody and they point it out at the end of the movie as if that makes it any less ridiculous! The writing gets flat out stupid at times because Rian Johnson is a moron. There's a scene where the detective claims that the case is like a doughnut with a hole that needs to be filled by a doughnut hole. No, I'm not kidding. Rian Johnson is this stupid! Our lead character can't lie or else she vomits uncontrollably. No, that's not from a Simpson's episode, it's from the latest Rian Johnson picture.I was at a sold out showing and more people clapped at the end of the Dora the Explorer movie! Sorry, this was yet another messy Rian Johnson script filled with too many characters and random plot developments."
115,"I was recommended this movie as a classic whodunit with clever twists and colorful characters. But the twists weren't all too clever and the whodunit isn't so classic.
It is a stylish movie, but the story is actually rather lame and unexciting when you take away the A-list actors and the glossy finish. Besides, a few key scenes don't really make sense, but have to be that way because the plot wouldn't work otherwise (meeting dangerous people in dark alleys instead of crowded places type of stuff).
It was also impossible to miss the racial undertones. The makers of the film were obviously drawing a metaphor for the demographic shift in America, clearly expressing their satisfaction with a certain majority being on the way out. (Once you see the final scene you'll know what I mean.)Bottom line: You can watch it and you won't get bored, but don't expect too much."
116,"The drama started from a murder but at always there's a detective who can solve a case with his mind, in a half we find who is a muderer but here a twist....... ( Go and find that twist by yourself ) 😁"
117,"A typical Agatha film,both directors and actors are very good people,It won't disappoint."
118,Great assemble of casts and great editing lead this movie into an entertaining ride. Not so fresh from Daniel Craig apart from the accent.
119,"Another brilliant piece of cinematography from Rian Johnson. The film is great as it twists through the murder of mystery writer Harlan Thrombey. Chris Evans, Daniel Craig, and Ana de Armas shine in this film as they bring this film to comedic peaks. The film leaves some to be desired as the ending can be predicted quite easily, but is still a charming movie that's still pretty funny. I first thought it would be bad as it appeared that James Bond was playing Colonel Sanders as Sherlock Holmes, but as I watched it Daniel Craig stands out as a comedic character and probably my favorite character overall. The movie taking place in Thrombey's dark mansion helps set a tone and mood for the film as a whole. The creepiness of the mansion gives an uneasy tone for the audience and is used to great effect from the use of knives everywhere to the foreign-appearing furniture and decorations. The film is one of the best whodunits I've seen."
120,Interesting and gripping with lots of twists and turns
121,"A tight plot. Great acting. Clever editing and screen play.
A classic whodunnit with several twists. You have probably guessed part of the plot by halfway through but there's more to come.
It is a little tongue in cheek, starting slowly like an Agatha Christie then warming up.
A few stars knocked off for being overlong and somewhat lacking in tension."
122,"Complete tosh. What does it tell you when the audience is praying for the film to end so we can all go home.
What idiot gave this the green light I'll never know.
Daniel Craig will be mortified when he looks back on this. His best friend must bite the bullet and tell him man to man that he's made a fool of himself. His Fohorn Leghorn accent is just cringing.
Dear film buffs save your money."
123,"I read through a lot of user reviews after seeing this today because I couldn't believe the high rating which is why I saw it in the first place. Seems like a lot of people don't like the director because of a Star Wars film he made. Well I'm not a fan of Star Wars and I can tell you the only thing this movie has going for it is a somewhat enjoyable first 20 minutes plus it seemed pretty to look at. That's all. My 10 year old daughter could have written better dialogue than this. I could see the guy sitting next to me getting very agitated about half way through so I asked him is he ok. He said to me
""What the hell is this I'm watching,""
I am not sure I would even recommend this for streaming considering how much good content there is out there."
124,"What might have been an amusing film was ruined by the introduction of immigration related politcking, as well some racism and political slander in the depictions. Caused the loss of suspension of disbelief that would have allowed one to overlook the numerous implausibilities in the plot."
125,"I have never seen any Star Wars films and have no knowledge of this director. I went to see it because of the starry cast and a good review in The Observer, a UK paper I respect. Also, I like country house whodunnit stories.
This was however a big disappointment. The warring family were uniformly horrible; I suppose they were meant to be, but they portrayed it so well that it was just unpleasant to watch. Daniel Craig has been an excellent Bond (and earlier, very good as Francis Bacon's lover), but here he was just awkward and his accent pretty ridiculous.
There was plenty of humour, which was OK at times, but overall that just meant that the film didn't seem to know whether it was a comedy or a serious story.
The worst bit was the long final denouement part, which was incredibly verbose and convoluted. I wasn't left feeling sad, happy, satisfied, intrigued or even angry - just flat. Avoid this film."
126,"When 85 year old mystery writer multi millionaire Harlan Thrombley (Christopher Plummer) is found with his throat slit, foul play is naturally suspected. Previous to his demise he decides to cut his parasite family out of the will and give it to his nurse Marta, (Ana De Armas) much to the angry chagrin of the rest of the family. Meanwhile famed detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought on the case by a mysterious employer to untangle things.Clue anyone? Performances by all the suspects are arch and played for laughs but not many materialize. They are simply en masse a greedy, unctuous family offering broad performances and cringing personalities while Craigs corn porn accent grills suspects with marbles in his mouth.Rian Johnson's direction is anemic as he relies on guilty expressions in wide angle to advance his predictable plot that attempts to have two mysteries (one to clear our heroine, one to find the real culprit ) hanging in the balance and both are torpidly pursued.The real star is ultimately the mansion and its incredible interior of furniture, secret passages and fantastic wall paper that gives the film a Gothic mystery feel. It at least gives you something to look at while Craig mumbles and surly family members crumble."
127,"I had high hopes for this movie. The Trailer showed a lot of stars and looked promising. But after watching this movie the Trailer was put together much better than the movie itself. The parts in the trailer that looked good did not do well in the movie. The movie left me very flat. Also the BS political leftist undertone was obvious. Not particularly well acted and the plot was abysmal. This is the polar opposite of good movies like The girl with the Dragon Tattoo, the Maltese Falcon, The usual suspects, Primal Fear and others. No this will not be a go to murder mystery that goes down as a classic. Its pure cinematic junk."
128,"Where do we start?
Ah yes, "" I hated every minute of it but cannot be bothered to watch it again to understand why"", paraphrasing the genius of ""Yesterday"" masterpiece by Mr Danny Boyle.
A needlessly convoluted plot with literally hundreds of details which add nothing to the movie, there is even a useless car chase for no reason other than stretch the time of the movie. Badly written and directed, wasting a cast of almost 'have been' A listers and the APPALLING performance of the Idiotic Creole/ British Columbo put forward by a out of his depth mr Craig... wow I cannot see him sinking any lower than this. The few exceptionally brilliant dozens of seconds that Christopher Plummer appears in this movie do not redeem a confused script and story line that makes little sense and makes the performances of anyone else in the movie seem amateurish at best. I cannot see any reason whatsoever to give this ""thing"" more than one star. Avoid without looking back."
129,"The most unfortunate thing about this film is that it is not so much of a turkey that you don't flounce out of the cinema half way through like you ought to. Daniel Craig is seriously miscast as the all-knowing and complicit detective. How, ffs, are we to take this piece that mixes outright ridiculous scenarios - e.g. a privately employed PI telling the real law what to do, when etc. We have caricature cardboard cutouts of murder-mystery stereotypes, dreadful script and extremely poor plotting. We are left looking at all the gewgaws and other props that don't seem to have any significance or interest value to the characters. Two giant eyeballs on sticks, for example? We have the servant good, employer bad shtick given the modern racist wash but we've had enough of that laundry. Frankly, the whole enterprise is a bore-a-thon. If it was supposed to be funny, that went right over my head. Jokes normally make me laugh. This joke of a film left me dozing."
130,"I don't who is giving this film bad ratings, because it is everything you would want in a murder-mystery thriller. It takes a genre that has been done a million times and adds something new. Rian Johnson's script is sharp, witty, and at times heartbreaking. Go see this film! It is worth it!"
131,"Spoilers... so proceed at your caution... But, this movie was dumb...Talk about mystery without logic... How the heroine is still not liable for several crimes in the death of the old man is beyond ridiculous. One thing that old who done it movies had were actual logic that worked... Not some illegal immigrant fantasy of being told every 10 minutes your doing a good job even though you killed the guy... LOLAnd the way the movie is edited is totally without drama... it was like they didn't want any drama or suspense.What happened to good writing, good editing.... If I had to say anything good, it was the acting and locations used were cinematic..."
132,"What could have been a good movie is ruined by the political nonsense. The trailers don't show you this, but it influences the movie in a big way to the point of being incredibly preachy and annoying like Terminator Dark Fate. If this bothers you, don't see it."
133,"Here goes Rian again on his ""I know best"" agendas, last time ""toxic masculinity"" this time ""white privilege"" well asians earn more than white people Rian, I don't see you bashing them.1 extra star because past this idiots political agenda smoothed movie there is actually the resemblance of a good movie"
134,Possibly the most tedious movie I've ever seen. Nothing happens!
135,"Add me to the list of people who went into this with high expectations (after having read so much praise about it) and came out of it utterly disappointed.In terms of production value, it's not a bad movie -- good cinematography, genre-appropriate production design, suitable music, big-name cast (though heavily underused) and so on.But what matters most in this genre is a good story, a clever crime and cues that give viewers something to think about throughout the film, and a resolution that puts all the pieces of the puzzle together and provides a satisfactory conclusion. Sadly, the opposite happens here.The story doesn't know what it wants to do and feels like four different drafts of a script were mashed into one. It begins like the classic whodunnit where you have a whole group/family of suspects, all of them with motives, and you need to figure out who's lying and why -- except that after the introduction of all the family members, most of them get tossed aside and will only be cardboard characters without much significance for the rest of the movie.Instead, the second part now shifts the focus to the young nurse who found the deceased family patriarch (who happened to be a famous author of, you guessed it, crime novels). And we get to spend about 45 minutes only with the nurse's part of the story -- and the mystery behind the death is revealed. It was all just an accident with some switched medication, but in his dying moments, the patriarch decides to make it look like a suicide in order to protect his beloved nurse friend because she's an immigrant and her mother could get deported and so on and on.At this point, a viewer with high expectations is thinking ""okay, no, it can't be this simple? The nurse is probably playing a long con and has only pretended to accidentally switch the medication... or maybe the crime author is playing a game with her and just faking it all because, after all, we've never seen a closeup of the dead body, nor the funeral, nor his actual death...""Sadly, this is not where the movie is going. Instead, the third part of this script mashup begins and the one remaining family member who hasn't been ruled out completely by this point conveniently shows up and becomes part of the story -- and he's such an ass in such a non-subtle way that a viewer with high expectations is praying to the crime story gods that Rian Johnson will have something better up his sleeve than what he's telegraphing in this part of the story -- but, nope. It turns out, this ass whom we've barely seen throughout the first half of the movie did indeed want the family patriarch dead and had a hand in this not-so-accidental switch of medication.Which leads us to the final part of the script, in which Rian Johnson desperately tries bring this mess to a good conclusion -- and fails. By now, everything is way too convoluted: It was an accident that turned into a fake suicide that turned out to have been an attempted murder that eventually led to a real murder of the family's housemaid who had figured out the real murderer (who had actually only attempted the murder) and therefore invited him into a deserted laundromat (because that's definitely where you want to meet alone with a killer!) where he wanted to kill her but he once again messed up and didn't properly kill her so she was still alive when the nurse arrived in order to meet with someone blackmailing her about the crime she hadn't committed, and she saves the housemaid's life but as a consequence has to turn herself in for a crime she didn't commit only for the detective to suddenly figure it all out and the not-yet-an-actual-killer giving them a detailed confession right before the housemaid dies in the hospital so that we now have a real murder and a real confession from an actual killer.... or something.If you thought this last paragraph was impossible to follow along and annoyingly written, then congrats, that's like how I felt when the detective gave his endless monologue at the end of the movie explaining the whole crime.Long story short: This movie isn't well written. It's not the entertaining detective story/whodunnit mystery that it wants to be. At its core, it's yet another story about a patriarch changing his last will and getting killed by a disgruntled heir. But this simple plot is buried under a convoluted mess of coincidences and side-plots that don't really matter much in the end.The biggest mystery of ""Knives Out"" is why so many people praised it and why it's even getting a sequel. When that comes out, I'll be watching something else."
136,"After seeing the trailer, the first thing you notice is the fantastic ensemble cast, but you might not expect this movie to be that comedic to be honest, more of a Thriller vibe. This movie decides to be a satire for the first 30mins, a silly comedy for the next 90mins and throws in some Thriller minutes for the fun of it, like playing Cluedo with Go-Stones, its a mess ad all over the place!This murder mystery ""reveals who the killer is"" halfway through the movie and still keeps on going, because it changes its premise after the first half, and now decides to be a different movie.All that being said... this movie is entertaining, for over 2 hours and reminds me how funny Daniel Craig can be. While the movie still suffers from the typical ensemble cast problems, it almost satirically plays with its own flaws and doesn't take itself to seriously.It's absolutely not a movie that you will remember in a few months, but its a light-harded comedy that will make you laugh a few times and that's what a comedy is about after all.I'm not sure if this is a movie you have to experience in the cinema, but it will be the perfect movie for a lazy rainy Sunday once it hits the streaming services!"
137,A 45 minute mystery stretched out for two hours! You can figure out who's innocent within the first 30 minutes! This story is so 'actuel' the political/social overtones are unpalatable to the plot. If the average viewer fails to notice this - then they are in a coma!Plot - a death has occurred in a 'manifest destiny mansion'. And Daniel Craig as inspector 'Benoit Blanc' is hired to investigate. (Personally I think Craig is being groomed to be the Louisiana version of Hercule Poirot). But that phony southern drippy bougainvillea accent is very nerve wrecking. Please don't!The mystery is good but the process to solve it is needlessly long.
138,"So not a bad movie but I don't see what all the hype was about..
Daniel had the worst accent.."
139,"This big-name cast overacts its way through this lame excuse for a whodunit. You would think that this writer/director would have learned his lesson after The Last Jedi, but the identity politics are here, front and centre.
The plot itself is not that great. The whole purpose of this genre is to keep the audience guessing until the denouement, but even half asleep I had figured out who the baddie was and had more or less unraveled the plot. Johnson is no David Mamet.
This picture tries to capture the smartness of an Agatha Christie novel or play like The Mousetrap or The Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side, with the upper crust players, the old house, a will reading and the cliched characters. Each of the suspects is from the imagination of someone obsessed with the 'basket of deplorables'. Every one of them has a flaw that makes them impossible to like, all are bigoted and avaricious when pushed out of their comfort zones. The main character, on the other hand, is so pretty and pure and perfect and kind. She's one big liberal stereotype, which is ironic, considering that the actress almost turned down the role because she felt it was too stereotypical.
Daniel Craig just plods through the picture with a pretty poor southern drawl.
I hope the film gods put an end to Rian Johnson's career sooner rather than later. How many disasters does it take before they wake up?
Rant over."
140,"Saw this at the festival circuit and was left completely unimpressed. An all star cast like this is usually a red flag for me that the story is going to be weak and I wasn't surprised. The Dialogue and characters are all super pretentious, and don't speak like real people so it's hard to care at all what happens. The twists feel cheap and unearned and sometimes it feels like things that are setup are never paid off in satisfying ways. Overall, AVOID THIS AT ALL COSTS! Major Pass!"
141,Why in Gods good earth would you use an English actor to play the part of a southern version of Columbo!?!? It was horrible. It would have been a thousand times better to have Monk star in this movie. I couldn't wait for this movie to end. Holmes and Watson was more tolerable at least you knew going in it was a crap movie with half hearted attempt to act. Craig probably thinks he did a good job. Yuck.
142,I don't understand the nomination and positve reviews. It's just an OK movie. A missed opportunity to do something better.
143,"This movie was boring and predictable. Clue is worth watching, this is not. Jokes did not land. I am baffled by the high reviews. Save your money, this is a movie to wait to watch for free if you are looking to pass a few hours. Highly over rated, definitely over hyped."
144,"This movie is seriously missold. Having seen the trailers I expected a good old fashioned whodunnit murder mystery.Imagine my surprise that when the characters are first interviewed the film actually shows the true version of events. It's quite funny as one story contradicts another and the over the top characters throw digs at one another. This mechanic is also used when the murderer is interviewed... So yes, the murderer is know within the first 20 minutes of the film. The film also uses a plot device where one character cant lie without throwing up. It makes the investigation farcical when the detective has a 100% accurate witness statement. He may as well have had CCTV.So the investigation you already know the ending to, you're not rooting for the murderer to get away with it (which is what the film is really about) and the rest of the characters are made to be dislikable so you're not rooting for them either. So in a 90 minute film you have zero interest in the middle 70 minutes, it is incredibly boring.The final 10 minutes has a few twists that are truly ridiculous and I'd long ago lost interest."
145,What a waste of a stellar cast. The trailer shows almost all the scenes that the famous people are in together. The rest of the time you are watching a little known Cuban actress who is apparently the star of the movie. Yes I hated TLJ but I honestly hated this as well. Because the waste of talent of the cast a 1-star rating for me.
146,"Meh, it's okay. Not great, not terrible.Not as clever or smart as Rian wants you to think the movie or he is. I saw the ending coming about halfway through, and this isn't by any means ""original"" as Rian tries to sell it to be.This was a slow SLOW moving movie with little to no tension and a predictable ending.Rian Johnson's talent for mystery and suspense is on par with Daniel Craig's southern accent in this movie-not good.I can say that I'm glad I saw it in a theater to support movie going, but Rian has really overhyped this movie and wants you to believe it's a masterpiece he's created when it's really a slow-moving mediocre film at best without much substance at all.MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS did mystery and suspense much better than this one. Maybe I'm biased because I saw it right before this one and can't help but compare the two. Artistically, narratively, musically, and emotionally, this film doesn't even come close."
147,"Rian Johnson both wrote and directed this tantalizing mystery KNIVES OUT that resurrects the memory of Dame Agatha Christie, the Queen of mystery writers. For those who disbelieve his stature in this film, see it now. He has created a detective figure in Benoit Blanc that rivals Hercule Poirot!As much a story about a dysfunctional family's greed as a detective tale, the story (as briefly as is possible without committing spoilers) is condensed by Lionsgate as follows: 'When renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday, the inquisitive and debonair Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.' But that outline fails to focus on the intricate personality dissections of Harlan's family - and house staff: the shrewish Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her cheating husband Richard (Don Johnson) and their finagling son Ransom (Chris Evans); the vitriolic son Walt (Michael Shannon) and his wily wife Joni (Toni Collette) and their children Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell) and Donna (Riki Lindhome); and Harlan's ancient mother Greatnana Wanette (K Calllan). Add to the mix the policemen (LaKeith Stanfield and Noah Segan), the house staff- healthcare nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) and housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) and everyone has a fine reason for wanting to see Harlan Thrombey dead!Daniel Craig shines as Benoit Blanc, despite an at times annoying overly Southern drawl, as does Ana de Armas, and the manner in which he pieces together the mystery is spot on. Excellent concept, spirited dialogue, and exceptional acting and cinematography make this a complete winner of a movie."
148,Great all around. Most mystery movies are predictable but this is just atypical
149,This movies keep me awake and continue watching until the end. I considered very good
150,"Knives Out is a wonderful homage to Agatha Christie novels - fans of Hercule Poirot are bound to enjoy this movie. Just as with the books, everyone has secrets and clues abound, and I had a blast trying to piece everything together before the characters could lay it out. There's nothing particularly new or innovative about Knives Out, but it is a great watch for anyone who enjoys a classic whodunit."
151,"Knives Out surprised me. I went into the film expecting a fun, light hearted movie that I would forget about in a day or two. Instead I witnessed one of the best mysteries in recent years. The film has one of the best casts of characters in a recent movie thanks to the brilliant and witty writing and the fantastic performances by all the lead actors, but it manages to tell a story which seems simple at first, but quickly evolves into a thrilling and engaging plot where every scene throws a curve ball that makes you question everything you suspect about the characters and what they have done."
152,Brilliant from start to finish. My movie of the year! A real must see!
153,"This movie checks all the boxes. Funny, thought-provoking, sad, exciting, suspenseful, and most importantly: rewatchable. After watching this movie 4 times, I can STILL say that there is not a single moment where I'm just waiting for the next scene, hoping for the story to move on, or not entertained. Rian Johnson has managed to make every single second fascinating. Almost every character is memorable, and their interactions with each other are fantastic. Each time I rewatch this movie, I catch something new. Some hint to a reveal, a subtle detail referencing future events, or a great section of background dialog comes to light and just makes the movie more and more enjoyable. I cannot say enough good things about this.I have no complaints. This film is nothing short of perfection."
154,"This movie is freaking amazing, it made me laugh, it made me cry. The plot twist at the end... how do you think out such an amazing story, and twist it like that??"
155,"Once you get passed Daniel Craig's frankly bizarre accent, this is an absolutely brilliant murder mystery that successfully manages to keep the audience guessing despite revealing the killer early on. Or does it? Essential viewing for murder mystery fans"
156,"This movie was just what I needed. I can't recommend it enough for anyone, very clever with A Grade actors all the way!"
157,"The best of novel movies, f7ll of suspense and mystery, makes you interested."
158,"I was so looking forward to this. I found it unwatchable. I stuck with it for the first 1/2 hour, and gave up. I guess maybe I'll check it out again in the winter, if it's still around. I'm reminded of that Woody Allen movie that took on the British house party genre (Magic in the Moonlight) - another one that I just couldn't stick with. OTOH, Robert Altman did it so well with Gosford Park.
Christopher Plummer is wonderful, of course. I quite liked Don Johnson in this. Michael Shannon was interesting as always. This movie has such a great cast, but I feel like they were squandered. This form of mystery, even if it's just that the director is taking the form and deconstructing it in order to build something else, deserves more. It wasn't funny on its own, not funny as its type of film. Sucks as social commentary. I'm usually griping about reviewers giving good movies really low scores. This time it's because I don't understand the really high scores. Sucks for me, sucks in general ;>"
159,"Although beautifully filmed, with good actors and decent performances, the movie is rather obvious and upon a bit of thought with quite some plot holes. All the history line surrounding Fran ( the cleaning person) makes no sense. It was entertaining indeed, but that's it."
160,"This is a really odd movie to review. On the one hand, I was on the edge of my seat the first half-ish of the movie - I was really into the plot and trying to ""figure out"" what the twist or payoff was going to be - only to find the second half to be mostly a disappointment. The main problem comes when it is revealed, half way into the movie, how/who the killer was and then the last half of the movie is just seeing the behind the scenes lead-up to that event and then the fallout.The reason it was disappointing to me was because in this genre of movie/storytelling there is always a moment of ""AH! it was so and so in the Library with the dagger"" and this movie doesn't have that, at all. Which is odd, since this is the genre Johnson went with. Which, i'm sure, was precisely the genre he wanted. It's just a weird mix of a murder mystery drama but without the ""guessing game"" payoff.It's like Rian went into this movie and said, ""I know what you expect from this genre, and so i'm going to play off of that and not give you what you expect from this movie, which will make it really fresh and different!"" Well, yes, you succeeded in making it different than other murder mysteries....but why? Now it's just a poorly done murder mystery."
161,"This is an entertaining film with a great cast but the hype had me expecting more. The cast is great but none of them had much of an opportunity to shine because of the limited screen time. I love Daniel Craig but he was the one character I didn't buy at all - it just felt like bad casting.There was some commentary on immigration that felt like typical Hollywood preaching but it ended up as feeling entirely forced and out of place.Had I gone into this movie with more modest expectations, I probably would've enjoyed it quite a bit. But given the hype and crazy good reviews, I was waiting the entire movie for it to get to the good stuff."
162,"I can say I was disappointed by this movie. First of all: in the first part of the movie Chris Evans barely appears but you do not involve such a famous actor if he's not a crucial character (so you can understand he is going to be at least among the guilty ones). Then, the nurse...she present herself as the honest one, but it just seems so obvious and boring. I was expecting her to be mean, almost hoping. Then... they present all the character as possible suspects, but they do not go deep. Overall I can say it was ok, nothing more."
163,There was no nerve in this film. And the actors was underused. I guess it was some kind of Orient Express inspired screenplay but to compete with Agatha Christie is(even if you put a Agatha look a like in the film)pure hubris of some dimension. There is no real finesse about the film and to have Daniel Craig talk in some southern dialect make no sense. Is it supposed to be funny?Doesn't add anything to this strained and rather dull movie. Is it only the English who can do a real whodunit?
164,"Short and sweet, I feel this film suffers from an identity crisis. Is it a comedy? Not enough even half funny moments. Is it a murder mystery? The spider didn't do it. Is it a thriller? It had the tension of a soap bubble. Is it fast paced? It helps to have nano naps. Now I will only see James Bond as CSI KFC and Captain America as a smug murderer. Three of us walked out of the cinema feeling conned. Not a classic."
165,"Things seemed to be going ok with this, until the ""I vomit when I lie"" part.
Then it lost me, that's some crazy lazy writing and spilled the whole movie from then on.."
166,"2019 has blessed movie fans with an impressively strong finish to the year in film. Among the excellent movies released in the past few months, ""Knives Out"" is perhaps the most purely entertaining. The star-studded cast pairing with a virtuoso director of consistently compelling movies served as powerful ingredients in the recipe for an entertaining movie, and the dish was prepared to perfection.Despite what a few angry Star Wars fanboys will tell you about Rian Johnson and his sacrilegious creation, ""The Last Jedi"" Johnson is one of the better writer/directors in Hollywood. In my humble opinion, Johnson's Star Wars movie is perhaps the best in the saga.Nevertheless, Johnson's latest romp should please all audiences. This film boasts one of the most impressive casts in recent memory, each member of which plays against type in a delightfully over-the-top fashion. Leading the pack is Daniel Craig (James Bond himself) playing a brilliant investigator named Benoit Blanc and flashing the same accent he would if he became the new KFC Colonel in the latest commercial. Yes, his southern drawl is comically exaggerated, but that is completely intentional. Many the best lines in the movie come with an implied wink at the camera, letting us know that everyone is in on the joke. Even Chris Evans (the beloved Captain America and the perhaps more beloved Twitter voice of good) plays a loathsome spoiled child of an entitled upbringing, who ruthlessly insults his family and hates dogs. I'll let you decide which of those traits is worse.As a whodunnit, the movie is effective in ways you might not see coming and in plenty of ways you will. Even though the events leading to the death are revealed 40 minutes into the movie, Johnson manages to subvert expectations and remain steps ahead of viewers until the very end. I dare you to guess every twist and solve the puzzle before Blanc. The character often looks to be underwhelming as a detective, but that is also intentional. He eventually reveals himself to be multiple steps ahead the entire time.Raw humor, suspense, and caustic social commentary combine to elicit one of the best screenplays of the year, one that deserves serious Oscar consideration. When the dust settles and mystery has been solved, the end result is a charming and satisfying mystery/comedy. We all deserve more movies like this, and we can thank Johnson for giving us one."
167,"I would rather have played clue that watch this as it was slow and in the end lacked a plausible payoff, ugh."
168,"Why do people think this movie is so spectacular. It's grossly unfunny, slow, boring, badly written and not even well acted, despite the ""star studded cast."" Daniel Craig is so painful to listen to with that ridiculous accent and there was so much vomiting that I could barely watch at times. Christopher Plummer was the only good thing about this movie and he's in it for about 5 minutes. The ""twist"" ending was so predictable that we had it figured out in the first act. I love mysteries, Agatha Christie, and especially, country house murder stories. This was painful to sit through and insulting to the real murder mysteries it is very loosely inspired by. I did give three stars for the cinematography, as the filming locations and sets were beautifully done."
169,"Daniel Craig's horrible accent would be enough to ruin the film for me, but there was so much more--the mugging by the characters, the stilted dialogue, the inane plot. Then there's the extended wrap-up that's supposed to make sense of the nonsense. I concede I'm in the apparent minority here. Perhaps it's just that I don't like farce, if that's what this was. There's not one idea or character that I want to think about for a minute more..."
170,"I don't understand the love for this movie. The only characters developed in the film are the ones directly involved in the twist. Ie the culprit is the only one who we see much of at all, as well as the main character. It appeared so screamingly obvious who the killer was i was utterly expecting to be outwitted and proven wrong but no it was that person all along. Such a great cast too and hardly a peep out of them, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, both with no character development whatsoever. Surely in a murder mystery you have to add more than just one motive (money) to keep us guessing. I really don't get it. The whole thing in fact was a dead giveaway SPOILER ALERT - when the main character injected the victim and he didn't immediately shut down. She literally dosed him 25x or more of his usual painkiller, such a stupid imperfection, if she was a nurse she would have known that he wasn't reacting in away someone would if they had been seriously dosed with morphine. Sure in the ins and outs of how the killer did it i didn't know but wasn't really anywhere near great enough to out merit the obviousness of the culprit. Anyway i could pick this film apart but its not really necessary if you enjoyed it, good for you."
171,"So many great actors involved in miserably crap movie...
Regrettable."
172,"Although we enjoyed this movie, it became really tedious as it was over the top woke.
White rich people - bad
White rich male people - extra super bad
South American migrants - good
South American illegal female migrants - extra super good.Pity as it was a really enjoyable movie otherwise."
173,Very boring they give away the whole storyline of how the man died in the beginning of the movie then its just slow up until the end. I think the movie would have been a lot better if we didn't give away the information of His death until the end. Almost walked out but towards the end the movie it starts to pick up & get interesting . Overall definitely a movie better to buy on Redbox than in the theaters 👎🏻
174,Wow I must just hate Rian Johnson after the Last Jedi but this film was so long in the tooth. Absolute no care about any of the characters. They are as boring as paste. I have no care about the story and do not see any draw towards Daniel Craigs forced accent. No one speaks that deeply of a drawl from the south come on now. This was a real disappointment and try it if you have time to waste thats all this is.
175,Knives out while has an amazing cast is predictable and a real letdown. I love murder mysteries but by the time you get to the twist ending you are left rolling your eyes
176,"I don't know how this went so horribly wrong, but my husband fell asleep and I was left wondering what to do with myself for two hours."
177,"First of all: who is responsible for letting this mess drag on for a totally unnecessary 130 minutes? They need to be fired for incompetence.So we have a gathering at a large country estate of a wealthy family celebrating the 80th birthday of its patriarch and source of income to all. He is discovered dead with his throat slashed the next morning. Enter the police and a private detective. Every family member and household servant is a suspect.Does this sound a bit predictable? Haven't we seen endless variations on this formula before? Except that here it starts to sag not long after the entrance of the police and - especially - once the private detective opens his mouth, it never recovers.While there is fine work (as always) from the great Christopher Plummer, almost everyone else seems out of place or uncomfortable with their roles.Chris Evans is an embarrassment and needs to stick to being a comic book character. He is clearly capable of nothing more.What totally kills this piece of fluff is the unimaginable casting of Daniel Craig (who is not aging well; he certainly can afford some work on his now-drooping eyes) as Benoit Blanc, the world-renowned private detective, profiled in The New Yorker. With that name, you'd expect someone eccentric, a bit humorous, and perhaps with a French accent.But no. Craig sounds like Lindsay Graham trying to speak with a British accent, but an octave lower His endless repeats of the facts of the alleged murder are nauseating and so distracting that I spent one entire scene trying to identify the soprano singing an aria from ""La traviata"" in the background. I just had to tune him out.And then I checked the time again and found that the big reveal - typical in such a formulaic movie - of the family being gathered for the final evidence to be presented and the murderer named occurs some 20 minutes before it actually collapses and dies.With the other American movies mentioned this year for possible Oscar nominations or the actual Golden Globe nominations, I have officially lost all interest and trust in films from that country. The best English-language films I saw this year are from Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand, and they will likely be shut out of competitions in favour of the empty twilight endeavours of the likes of Tarantino and, more so, Scorsese.My biggest takeaway from this garbage is that I have to get Anna Netrebko's album of Verdi arias!"
178,"This thing had all the elements of a classic Whodunit, great actors, atmosphere, but with a so so storyline. I was into it but a full spew of vomit right into someone's face? What adult finds this entertaining? There are 3 to 4 scenes of vomiting followed by a filthy full on spew...Knives out dropped from a 7 to a 4 for me...nothing entertaining about vomit."
179,"So I don't get the hype. I didn't think it was that great. There wasn't much to it. Doesn't make you laugh, no suspense, not very entertaining either. Seems like they filmed it in a day or two. There was no connection going on between any of the characters besides Christopher Plumer and his nurse. If it's free I'd say watch it but wait till it comes out on Netflix."
180,"Nothing special, a few twists and turns along the way but it's a bit obvious who was the antagonist. I'll give you the final washout was different but IT wasn't too hard to know the final destination, just the how to get there but took a little to unfold but it wasn't the most shocking twist."
181,Disappointingly the all star cast don't really get much to do. This is really just a retread of an Agatha Christie Poirot story but unfortunately takes itself far too seriously to enjoy the ride. What could have been a rip-roaring Old-school who-done-it ended up being very flat. Did anyone care who did it? Surely it's all about the getting there?!
182,"As many other have stated, the politics were totally unnecessary and ruined the arc of the film. Spoilers ahead.
 I thought it was going to be clever for Marta to have been the killer all along, and the black sheep of the family saw through her facade the whole time while his aunts/uncles accepted her into the family. This was the reason for the fight with Harlon, knowing marta's intentions to try and swindle the family fortune. This was why he sent the money to have Daniel Craig investigate. Pretty clever! Or at least I thought so until they showed otherwise. It turns out it's as formulaic as, hey, the kid no one likes in the family, that has never worked and is the biggest freeloader of all, turns out to be a vendictful murderer because he isn't getting any part of the will. Furthermore, as stated, the wealthy good for nothing white family gets misplaced by the migrant as she peers from ""her"" balcony beckoning them to leave her palacial estate. Oohhhhh how the tides have turned.Now... For a few other gripes since I'm a Nurse Anesthetist and give these drugs for a living. You'd never give 100mg of toradol (ketorlac) to anyone, especially not an 85 year old person due to its effect on kidney function. Stupid but I get it. 2nd, there are no 100mg vials of morphine because that is in fact a toxic dose. At most it'd be 10mg. Furthermore, even if you got 100mg of morphine, you wouldn't die, you'd just stop breathing (problematic but not death inducing). You can see Marta giving the other blackmailed mouth to mouth and then CPR so she knows how to do it. She could have just breathed for him while awaiting for paramedics. Not ideal, but certainly not a death sentence. It did nail that drugs are labeled similarly and mistakes do happen though.In the end, the tone is firmly cemented that white people are bad and don't deserve what they have. That's the message, loud and clear."
183,"This movie is waaay overrated. It is not a murder-mystery; it's yet another vehicle for Hollyweird to subtly push its liberal agenda. ""Illegals are good; Americans are bad."" That's the lesson. The illegal immigrant, or rather the daughter of an illegal immigrant, is literally painted as a saint. I can't count the times she's called ""a good person."" On the other hand, the American characters are painted as greedy, shallow, dishonest, and pathetic. This, juxtaposed with the immigrant saint is literally incapable of dishonest as she supposedly gets physically ill if she tries to lie.The ""mystery"" part of the plot is solved almost halfway through. I thought it was clear then that that part of the story was secondary. It was obvious to me, with the way the writers went out of their way to inject political discussions especially about immigration, into random conversations, and readily mocked the apparent non-liberal characters. I can't believe more viewers didn't catch this.In modern Hollyweird, the proselytizing comes first now, the art is secondary or tertiary. It was clear to me that ""Knives Out"" was simply a vehicle for a political agenda to be pushed. I should have known it would be, with TDS-stricken Chris Evans involved. But what a shame, as I was honestly looking forward to a legitimate murder-mystery. In my opinion, ""Knives Out"" was not that. I left the theater feeling duped."
184,"It's an ok movie for a mystery lovers, the only
part that was really annoying was that Daniel Craig accent..
wtf? So he tried it and at some point
someone should have told him no, just no."
185,"I'd such high expectations on this title and I've got very disappointed when it got to the ending and was unsurprisingly bad.I was base myself to IMDB ratings and at I'm
still don't get why people give good notes to Knives Out.Pass this one out if you can."
186,"I don't know if it was the hype that got my expectations too high or the fact that the mystery whodunit genre is something I love but this movie just didn't deliver as expected.I kept waiting for the movie to pull me in but it just never did. The actors were decent so it wasn't really an acting issue. Overall I felt the movie was celebrating its own cleverness the entire time. Of course when you celebrate your own cleverness it usually means you're not half as clever as you think you are.I understand there were some sociopolitical undertones that meant a lot to some folks. The sociopolitical commentary was less than subtle and pretty much just ended up being virtue signaling. Still, I won't stop anyone enjoying their game of wokemon and I know wokemon is important to Hollywood right now so ... whatever on that.Had the mystery whodunit aspect been really well done then this would have been a far better movie."
187,"This is a good movie with good stars. But I feel it is overrated and very slow. I enjoyed murder mystery more than this. Adam and Jenny were great at that. I did not feel connected to any of the characters until the end. I was just waiting for it to get over. Painful ending. I was waiting for after credit where that lady would say to her mom, something like this ""That took a lot of planning and acting, but No more need to do fake vomit anymore, hahaha"" I would have enjoyed that twist more.or we figured out that the killer got released from jail and then that nurse and killer finally hug each other and smile."
188,"There are a few moments in Rian Johnson's Knives Out that feel well written. Most of this clunky script, however, is not.From the lazy 'lying makes me gag' plot device, the completely flawless protagonist, the unnecessary Leftist political undertones... Knives Out is a bit of a mess.It takes too long to get going, and reveals far too much, too early on. There's a reason crime thriller conventions exist, and that's because they work. Rian Johnson seems to believe he is above such conventions, so it is no surprise when after 45 minutes or so, the film starts to fall apart after Marta is revealed as the ""killer"".Some have said this is a parody of the whodunnit genre, but there is only so far that excuse can wash. With plot holes galore (Harlan thought of that intricate plan for Marta in the space of 10 minutes?), and an abundance of 'far too convenient' explanations, as a viewer I stopped caring about who did what.It doesn't help that Marta is a one-dimensional character (basically a personification of Johnson's politics) who I couldn't root for. Actually, I was actively hoping she'd be killed. I'm sorry, she was annoying.Overrated and complete with a completely obvious finale/""reveal"" (I feel a bit cheated with that ending, Ransom was so obviously culpable from his introduction), you can't help but feel this film thinks it's way cleverer than it actually is."
189,"A full spew of vomit in the face! What adult would find that amusing. I'm a Whodunit fiend from way back, I was excited to see the cast line up but their talents were wasted on this film, Daniel Craig...no no accent please...I wanted more Jamie Lee and others, was Tony Collette suppose to be sexy? I was still having fun until they introduced vomit. Wtf? Vomit? Then a full charge to the face? DISGUSTING. The writers should be ashamed. Went from a 7 to a 4 the 4 was for the actors."
190,"I'm not gonna say it was completely awful. Some parts were funny and entertaining. But as for this being one of the best movies of the year... someone lied. Plot was pretty bad. The reveal halfway through the movie kinda killed it cause it just didn't make sense. And the twists and stuff were just dumb and nonsensical as well. I couldn't even finish it, I just read the ending on a synopsis I was so annoyed. I rented on Redbox thankfully for free but I feel bad for anyone that spent theater ticket and snack money for this mess.."
191,Such a wonderful cast and so many resources but still very poor. When she lies she vomits? Too bad story for good thriller. Despite my big expectations it came out as cheap hollywood movie.
192,"I'm sorry, I know Hollywood isn't going to be completely accurate, but no rando nurse carries around morphine in her ""bag"" and no one gets a run of the mill IV in their arm for a pulled shoulder and gets Toradol and morphine IV for this. That's just stupid. And why did she attempt to resuscitate Fran, but not Harlen? Dumb. I loved the costumes, although it's confusing, is it 1970 or now?? And the nurses mother has been in the states for how long? Like anyone gives a sh$& at this point that she's an illegal immigrant. Like, keep the money and get her citizenship, just dumb. And she vomits over lying but not the site of a man cutting his own throat?? I love Daniel Craig and I don't think his accent was bad but it wasn't the usual so it throws people. But it was funny that despite Rupublican or Democrat, all convictions out the window when money was involved."
193,"Gee, do I really need to watch a mystery movie to hear that immigrants are good and alt-right people are Nazis? Give me a break. Maybe writer/director Rian Johnson was trying to give some cultural context to the picture, but unfortunately the culture he is reflecting is his Kalifornia leftist echo chamber.
Aside from the distractive injection of immigration open borders advocacy, the film is a competent ensemble mystery comedy, easy on the comedy. In fact, if you aren't really looking for it, you may miss the humor, it is so innocuous and low-key, pretty much reflecting the state of comedy in America these days. Mustn't offend anybody with our humor, except of course rich white conservatives, who have no feelings, being pure evil.
The identity of the killer (who is of course rich and white) is kept well hidden for 95% of the running time, and for that, I give Knives Out 5 stars. It would have merited perhaps 7 stars, had Rian Johnson taken a few more chances in the comedy department, and withheld his dopey open immigration politics."
194,"Reviews are so good for such a boring film. Missed the mark.
Too many famous actors, no convincing roles."
195,"Actually i do not know what to think, the movie is normal and it cointatins not good performances, for me, the best was Martha, but the rest too much normal, mhmmm i guess i willonly watch this movie onece because my expectative were above than the movie, it is a normal movie, even more, it is not funny and the final part does nto contain surprise or a sort of inteligence, I did not like it"
196,"We always hit the movies over the Thanksgiving holiday with whoever is in town. 4 of 8 fell asleep at one point and all 8 of us were underwhelmed. Kept waiting for the plot to ignite, never happened."
197,"Sorry, not for me. Was really hoping to enjoy this. But, similar to the last highly rated whodunnit, Murder on the Orient Express, I was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed and, dare I say it, bored. Give me Lieutenant Columbo anytime over this."
198,"This little film was boring. I can't understand the good reviews it was given. Seemed more like a bad Columbo as someone else stated. Interesting that they cast Jamie Lee as a mother, looks more like she's 80."
199,"When not spoon-feeding you its plot through lots and lots of dialog and flashbacks, Knives Out takes ridiculous short cuts, the dumbest of which is a main character who throws up anytime she lies. In its better moments its obviously meticulously crafted but your ability to enjoy it will hinge on whether these amateur crutches sprinkled throughout are tolerable to you or not.There's another problem with this murder-mystery comedy. Neither of the main characters are very funny. Daniel Craig is trying too hard to stay on top of his (bad) southern accent and Ana de Armas basically has one facial expression the entire film: worry. All the funny is in Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis, who are completely underused and eliminated from the list of suspects far too early in the film. They never even elevate to credible threats to the protagonist by blunderingly interfering.Knives also can't help but wade into the current Hollywood vogue of jamming politics into literally everything. Exploration of political or social issues is a wonderful thing in film... when it's done right. Knives just hamfistedly tacks it on, and not in a subtle way. 40+ years after Blazing Saddles and this is what passes for progressive today. Of course she's poor and hardworking and can't even lie without throwing up. And because of her unrelenting honesty she wins in the end. But you know, those are generally *good* stereotypes so you critics better give it a good rating or else.Beyond its politicizing, Knives Out unfolds with a kind of smugness that's irritating. A self-assuredness of it's wit and writing it never quite achieves. What it does achieve is something approaching a diet cola version of a Coen Bros film. I'll be surprised if anyone still remembers this film once its early shine, and especially it's politics, wears off."
200,"UnderratedI disliked TLJ as a SW movie and particularly disliked some of the comments made by Rian Johnson; I therefore completely understand why people are annoyed with him. However giving fictional ratings to a completely different project is just childish.There is no way this movie is worth only one star, I give it 5 stars because the acting for the most part was decent and the overall story was fine, as was the cinematography, editing, directing, etc.OverratedThere is no way this movie is perfect and giving it a positive fictional rating is just as childish.To be honest, I became bored during the first half of the movie, the second half picked up somewhat. I expected more from the cast, none of them got me emotionally involved, I was happy enough to find out how it all played out but didn't find myself caring whether any of them did it or didn't do it or were ultimately 'good' or 'bad'.Red FlagI should know by now that when a trailer has to quote critics about how funny it is then it probably isn't. I laughed out loud once during the movie and was elsewhere amused literally only once or twice. I certainly did not get the humor that everyone 'talks' about.Go see it if you like this kind of movie and judge it on it's own merits...please."
201,"Politically charged, over rated film. Had potential. Unfortunately, one will need to endure conditioning from the Hollywood elite. Very disappointed."
202,Storyline is lame at best. If you just want to watch something while you munch on popcorn you may like it.
203,Daniel Craig and Toni Collette must be laughing all the way to the Bank. I saw this piece of rubbish tonight in Sydney with two friends. They both dozed off to sleep during this tedious nonsense. I can't believe some of the Actors putting their names to this. DON'T BOTHER !!
204,Go rent or stream clue and save yourself a few dollars
205,"It has a great cast that doesn't get enough work.
It confuses subverting expectations with cleverness.
It's a very very average if not outright bad movie.
Full of pop culture references that you're going to need a wikipedia article on standby if your kids are going to understand any of them in five years.
No idea why it gets the hype it's getting."
206,An entertaining film but i thought the script was a bit lazy. Too many obvious 'twists' that are hand fed to the viewer. You can work out most of the plot from the first 10 minutes. Daniel Craig's accent is one of the worst ive heard.
207,"Knives Out is a new crime drama directed, written and partly produced by Rian Johnson, the director of Looper and Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi.In the film, the successful crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead on his estate. Harlan recently had his 85th birthday which makes all the guests of his birthday party a suspect of the murder. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is now trying to investigate what happened and who is responsible for the death of Harlan Thrombey.This film is a new murder mystery film such as the 1985 film Clue, the film version of the board game Cluedo. As a viewer you try to discover together with the detective who is responsible for the death of the murdered character. Unfortunately, as a viewer you get more information about the murder mystery at a time than the characters in the film itself. So as a viewer you already know a little more than the characters and you can start to get ahead of the story. Rian Johnson tries to confuse you as a viewer with astray. Many of these traces are unfortunately not appropriately or clearly brought forward in the film, which means that final disclosures may seem somewhat unclear. Because of this lack of clarity, the film comes across as somewhat lengthy. With the film they try to explain everything to the viewers at the end, but this goes against the self-examination for which fans of murder mystery films watch such films.The cast of this film consists of many great actors and actresses such as Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Christopher Plummer. Daniel Craig uses a separate accent in the film all the time, which sometimes makes him look more comical than really as a serious detective. Of the cast, Ana de Armas comes out best in the film as the maid of the deceased. As maids, she plays a major role in gathering information about the murder mystery, because she knows all the family members and worked for them. Furthermore, Michael Shannon manages to provide a few comic moments in the film as the youngest son of the deceased."
208,"After going to the theater and watching this movie, I have come to the conclusion I should have stayed home, saved my money and watch paint dry on a wall, anything would have been better than that flop."
209,"Outstanding performances by the all-star cast, great directing and cinematography, and the score was fitting for this amazing whodunit story, but I felt the screenplay needed some trimming and/or the pacing sped up in the first half of the film. The 130 min run-time felt too long and was evident when the perfect pacing started towards the ending. This film should've been no more than 100-110 mins. Nevertheless, a really entertaining story of mystery, thrills, suspense and a touch of comedy in the right places."
210,"So, this is a bad remake of Clue... but...""The bad scores are because of Star Wars fans"" And, honestly I am sure that some of them are... but once more we see people attacking anyone that doesn't give a Rain Johnson 10 out of 10.""The bad scores are conservative trolls"" And once again we see people, and Johnson, attacking anyone that doesn't like this film.Once again people are throwing a fit because other people don't like the exact same thing they do.But to be honest, again, I can see that. This is overtly political, and by ""overtly"" I mean that they are screaming through a megaphone, at just about every opportunity, to inject their politics into it.Other than that, it is kind of like Clue... if Clue was very careful not to insult some people in their jokes, and very focused in an attempt to insult others with a sheer and unadulterated prejudice. And that kind of makes for a very awkward film where the jokes are so self-aware they can't help but fail.So, basically that is what you are getting, Clue with jokes aimed at the politically correct and a hearty injection of politics. And that is all you are getting.But, hey, if you haven't seen Clue, you might like it. And, if you share the politics and think they should be shrieked in everything, you will totally like it.The rest of us are just going to watch Clue."
211,"I love the atmosphere and style of this movie... but that's where the accolades stop. Okay, shots are nice and acting is good too. The main problem is the storytelling. You find out so much about the ""mystery"" so early that it completely deflates the tension. Rather than the story building toward an exciting conclusion, it plods along to the inevitable. To call this is a mystery is not accurate. It's a character story where characters lie and try to outmaneuver each other. But it wears thin, because it mostly feels like an acting showcase."
212,"I watched it on a rainy Fall afternoon and it helped to set up the whole mood, as that's when the storyline happens. A movie full of twist set in beautiful scenery of Michigan. The cast is great. Especially Toni was brilliant!"
213,"Loved the movie.the gripping storylinelocationcostumedialoguesacting, everybody was amazing. I personally loved Toni Collette, Chris Evans and Michael Shannon"
214,"As interesting as this movie was I think it could have been a bit better. But who am I to complain. The Who done it kept me guessing for most of the movie. It was well acted and filmed, good entertainment"
215,"Watched this on the weekend 22/08/2020. All I can say is.. I just can't get enough, every second of this movie is just beautiful. Amaze me from the start 'till the end. I love the scenery, screenplay, the way the story told, the unexpected plot, and obviously all the great cast in it. Especially Ana De Armas, her character is so pure and kind.This is the movie that will satisfy you in everything, not only the whodunit part. One of the best movie in 2019, hands down."
216,"Going into this movie I thought it would be predictable, but I was wrong. This movie has a different spin on murder mysteries and that's why I liked it so much. Captain America and James Bond had a great performance. I liked the energy I saw from them tonight. I had a phenomenal time."
217,"With Rian Johnson, I hated the work he did on the last Jedi, but his work on Knives out was exceptionally an amazing experience to watch! I always love these kinds of mysteries with twists but his twists were so unexpected and nothing like I've ever seen in these crime thrillers. Especially near the end of the movie when my mouth was hanging down!! Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Katherine Langford and especially Ana de Armas, along with everyone else in the cast, were fantastic! I don't know what the sequel will be about and how it will progress to continue this story that left off on such a deserving and only ending, but whatever it is, I'm prepared and excited! Watch the Movie!! Please!!!!!!!!"
218,"JUST WATCH IT. I promise, you will not be disappointed. My 14 year old son ""ok I'm going to say it, it's my favourite movie ever"". Xx"
219,"This film went above and beyond. It sucked for 2 hrs and 10 minutes. A whodunnit where the viewer is hardly involved, just presented sterotypes of outlandish people (get ready for SJW speak and the naïveté that comes with the extreme left). Everyone's repulsive, except for the Colombian maid whose purity rivals that of the baby Jesus. Like I said, you just watch the narrative unspool, but it's no fun because you're not given enough character development for the viewer to turn into a participant. Screenwriting seems to be a lost art form, more and more. The last 15-20 mins of the movie is nothing short of the detective telling the viewer and other cast members who did what to whom. It's essentially what should have been the pitch for the studio, but instead of turning it into a film, they just let Daniel Craig explain it all in one breathless and BORING ""finale"". The Neverending Boring. Like I said, it sucked for 2 hrs and 10 minutes. You'd expect a better climax."
220,"The whole story line was stupid , what a waste of time . can't believe people on here are actually giving this a 10 ...like seriously ?"
221,"This is one of those films that leaves me actually annoyed. Why? Because with an outstanding cast the end result is far less than the sum of its parts.I had no issue with Daniel Craig's southern accent. I think he was thoroughly enjoying himself throughout. Others, such as Jamie Lee Curtis, were totally underused. Having Ana de Armas' character vomiting whenever she lied was a pretty silly idea.But what the film really lacked was genuine intrigue and a great big twist. Seriously, an episode of Poirot holds more, or either of the very good Sherlock Holmes reboots.No point seeing it at the cinema."
222,A Moderate Paced Setup Turns Into a wonderfully woven tale of intrigue and mystery. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was suspenseful and well played. Two thumbs up.
223,"Definitely one of the best Rian Johnson films. Film that takes us to one of the most modern Cluedo imaginable, despite the presence of characters, environments and plot already potentially seen, offers an original vision and a remarkable signature of Johnson in this genre, a very unique one. Stellar cast, characterized at the right point to intrigue and capture attention all the time. Plot with a rhythm that never tires and that always keeps on thorns thanks to the brilliant direction full of tasty dialogues amd amazing framing of each situation and character. Picture that fascinates, albeit by treating such a dismal plot with genius, but which highlights the fun with which it was conceived."
224,"Probably the best film I have seen this year and one of the most memorable theatrical experiences I have ever had seeing it at its world premiere at TIFF. Thanks to the success of his previous studio film, The Last Jedi, Johnson gets to create a passion project that is so desperately needs to be seen in theatres.Johnson shows his love for the murder mystery genre but avoids falling into its predictable plot mechanics. The opening of Knives Out sets the table of what you would expect from this kind of premise on paper. The death of the celebrity author Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) brings in all the family members seeking the opportunity to selfishly claim his inheritance and the strange circumstances of his passing calls in private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) to solve the case. But once most of the character archetypes are established within the first act, Johnson allows his originality as a filmmaker to take over. From they're the perspectives shift and the twists elevate the story in a direction that is refreshing and surprisingly really funny. The humor becomes unrelenting and infectious, as everyone in the theatre could not hold back the laughter, with Johnson playing on genre's tropes and being meta about it.Johnson lets each of the cast members have fun and stand apart from one another with each playing really dynamic and complex character he has written. Chris Evans just relishes in playing the ruthless and yet complex grandson Ransom and doesn't hold back on spitting insults to anyone including his own family members. Michael Shannon plays a role slightly less antagonistic and more pathetic as youngest son Walt who gets no respect from his family. Jamie Lee Curtis continues to be a force of charisma to watch as the eldest daughter Linda. Even smaller but no less significant roles like Noah Segan and Lakieth Stanfield are also worth calling out.While Daniel Craig may get top-billing in the poster, the movie completely rest on Ana De Armas to carry the story and serve as the audience's perspective into this world. As Harlan's nurse Marta, she shows how isolated and alone she feels with the rest of Thrombley family despite they pretend to have her best interest. But as the plot progresses, De Armas gets to show range including some unexpected comedic moments and becomes more of a pivotal role in the mystery.
Daniel Craig gives full commitment to his over-the-top character. Craig as Blanc gets some of the best and most hysterical lines as he spout bizarre and confusing analogies in a super-thick Southern accent. He strikes a good balance of intelligence and hysterical as a man who is very perceptive of people's intention but also being really exaggerated and ridiculous in a good way.Similar to what he did with the Star Wars franchise in the Last Jedi, Johnson brings in social political commentary into a very old and tired genre to make if feel relevant. In this case, he uses the Thrombey family dynamic to tackle issues on the wealth of the 1%, immigration and self-entitled privilege. In the opening interview, Harlan's adult kids and in-laws all say they believe that each of their successful careers come from hard work despite flashbacks reveal they leech off of Harlan's own self-earned wealth and celebrity name. And with Marta coming from an immigrant family and being Harlan's personal nurse, the Thrombey's keep acknowledging subtly and (unsubtly in a heated family argument about politics) her lower status in society to boost their ego even they think it comes from a sense of sympathy. The oblivious nature and lack of wokeness most of the family retains (particularly with Don Johnson's and Toni Collete's characters) shows how much they have been too sheltered in their own rich bubble that creates a lot of great satirical humour.Regardless if you liked or disliked The Last Jedi, are fan of Rian Johnson in general as a filmmaker or just love the murder-mysteries in film, Knives Out is a big crowd pleaser that uses its huge big name cast to full efficiency. Just when you think you have the plot figured out, it adds twists upon twists that don't dragged down the story but elevate. Once it comes out in nation-wide theatres, see it as soon as you can."
225,"Don't waste your time. It was obvious who ""dunnit"" from the beginning of the movie. Lazy, terrible and laughable attempt at a detective movie."
226,Let me start by saying I knew who the killer was 15 minutes into the movie. The acting was all OK. The sets were OK. The casting was a little unusual. But the story was a stinker! If you couldn't figure out who the killer was in the first 15 minutes you were probably unconscious. There's a segment of the movie about halfway through that's at least 40 minutes too long. I wanted to get up and go sit out in the lobby and wait for it to end. It was so boring and tedious to watch. Save your money on this one. Watch it on TV when it comes out on TV next year.
227,"Comparing the writing of this movie to whodunit TV serials and other film in this genre, I was particularly annoyed in how the move decides to blatantly tell me the facts rather than allowing me to come to logical guesses and for the characters to explore and accuse based upon logical guesses and come upon the actual truth and expose the perpetrator. This is done directly through the dialogue and focal points in certain shots.
I give it a 5 out of 10 for the effort within the acting from each individual. They do provide good embodiment of the characters that they are to be and sell it well."
228,Nothing special to see here. Just a tired old cast rehashing cluedo. Poor writing and direction. Don't waste your money.
229,Rian Johnson is terrible at his chosen profession. This movie is predictable and it's attempts at humor are juvenile and fall flat. It felt like it was 4 hours long as I found myself wanting it to end about 30 minutes into it. Not worth your money or time.
230,"Started out nicely in a big house with a rich dad. Fun seeing Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Don Johnson. Then it went downhill. The detective includes one of the member in his investigation (and she was no Jessica Fletcher). Soon it dissolved into the current theme of our times that immigrants (legal or illegal) are good and white people are bad."
231,Omg. This show was sooooo stupid. Just a chance for good actors to play dumb characters together. Don't waste your un theatre movie budget
232,"Film is complex, but in a way that's unclever and unnecessary. Very poor storytelling and directing. If you're planning on watching the film to see the star-studded cast, you're better off just spending your time watching Endgame or What's Your Number again."
233,"Knives Out has found a way to turn many of the genre's tropes on their heads and that very much deserves to be praised. Ana De Armas is touching, vulnerable, truthful, endearing, and outshines pretty much the entirety of the remaining star-studded cast, which is also very impressive.
Overall, after a very clunky beginning, we get into the story and it moves pretty smoothly throughout, and the movie keeps its momentum going until at the very least, the end of the second act.But when we get to the third act, it starts to feel like the need for never ending twists takes over at the cost of logic and realism, which obviously is often the case in these kinds of movies. But, I would argue a truly successful murder mystery should end with the realization that we have been staring at the truth all along and yet couldn't quite see it - and in that respect, I feel like the movie fails.
It also fails in portraying characters that feel real for the most part - with the exception of Ana De Armas, everyone feels a little bit like a caricature, best exemplified by the sixteen year old teenage boy who spends his entire time on his phone to promote the alt-right. Many of such cliches are played for humor, but for the most part, the few comedic moments of the film fall flat - in particular, Daniel Craig's sadly clumsily delivered Detective character, meant to be an American Hercule Poirot, but whose quirks are simply forgettable and frankly, unimaginative.Finally, the story simply does not fully deliver on its themes, its conclusion feels rushed and shallow: good people end up happy, and bad people are punished, no redemption or nuance whatsoever, the story is black and white, and that may have worked during Agatha Christie's time, but I don't think modern audiences will accept it as easily."
234,"Hollywood loves this director, most people do not. When you read the bad reviews they point towards unfunny jokes, slow pace, and some bad acting leading to that score. When you read positive reviews it says they are retaliating against Star Wars fans who dont like Johnson. I figure they are deserved either way."
235,"But the movie was just plain boaring, formulaic and predictable. Fair acting and little character development."
236,"Overacting, poor script and an end you can predict from minute 1. What a waste of time. Daniel Craig should be al ashamed."
237,"...After I already wasted mine. I should have known, after he had ruined Star Wars. Daniel Craig was pretty disappointing as well, but he might have fared better with a stronger co-lead. Smh"
238,"He did it again, and he keeps getting away with it1.How conveniently Marta's weird puking condition is suitable to the situation, and how anyone could have use it to crack the case in 5 minutes but no one did.
2.The sweat on Harlan forehead and how it's a symptom for morphine overdose.
3.How conveniently you can burn all evidence by one overpowered Molotov cocktail with no digital database back up.
4.How conveniently did Marta have a magnet to erase the VHS which never brought up after.
5.How conveniently stupid Fran was by agreeing to meet the killer in a secluded place alone.
and don't get me started on ""You"" and ""Hugh"".on the plus side the frame shots and the cinematography were great....but they weren't able to overturn the abysmal lazy writing.yet another overrated work from Mr. Johnson to put next to his previous overrated works:The Last Jedi and Looper."
239,"First things first, why did Ransom hired Benoit Blanc as a detective if he thought the toxicology results would find positive morphine?The police would think that only Marta could have access to the morphine (and her finger prints would be on it) and thats it!! No need for a detective like Benoit!"
240,"As a lover of the old ""whodunnit"" genre, I really had high hopes for ""Knives Out."" It does, after all, have many of the essential ingredients: an all-star cast, a big house, a slew of self-interested characters, an unexplained murder. However, the biggest mystery in ""Knives Out"" is how it murdered itself.There are several suspects. Was it the casting director, placing such a well-known English actor into the role of a Southerner with a drawl? I mean, Daniel Craig isn't just British, he's James Bond.Was it the cinematographer, designing grandiose camera moves into every scene, including simple dialogue scenes?Was it the actors who-outside of Toni Collette-didn't seem to understand this was meant to be a comedy?Was it the producers, who couldn't decide what this movie should be, a comedy, a thriller, a satire, an homage?In the end, I suspect it was the writer-director who did it, on the page, with a fountain pen. Only he decided that each character needed to explain their story to the viewer, rather than leaving us guessing. Only he failed to add the humorous touches that could have made it entertaining-and extract some truly lame jokes. Only he was responsible for hiring actors who couldn't deliver the right quirk or humour.It's a shame, because I really loved certain elements-the homage to ""Sleuth,"" the not-so-subtle political message, some of the twists. But I couldn't help feeling I wished it was a bit more like ""Hot Fuzz,"" with its humour, memorable characters and witty dialogue. And a bit more like ""And Then There Were None"" in terms of its suspense and mystery.Normally, I'd recommend a mildly entertaining film, especially one with a good message, but this one is way too much of a mess."
241,"Clue, Ten Little Indians, Murder by Death, and Murder on the Orient Express have been done before, with a cast of great stars that made the movies great.Knives Out is the B-movie version of Clue or Murder on the Orient Express. The cast is pretty good, but not great. It is great fun watching a lot of good actors talking to each other and hamming it up. The story lacks action. The plot twist creates more questions, than answers."
242,"This is the type of original film that I like to see come out of Hollywood, and it's a shame there aren't more original films of this quality being made. It's worthy of Oscar nods for Best Picture, Writing (Original Screenplay), and Film Editing. With that said I rate it a 7 (definite rent, might watch it again, easy to recommend to others) for a few reasons. First, I think the replay value on Knives Out is fairly low after you've seen it once due to the fact that it's a ""who done it"" mystery film. Once you know ""who done it"" and the various twists and turns involved, I'm not so sure it's as riveting with repeated viewings. Second, despite a star studded cast the only performance that impressed me was by Ana de Armas as the sympathetic Marta. I'm not sure if Daniel Craig's supposed to have a cajun accent or a more standard southern accent, but whatever it is it's not very good. His detective character is very well written though, so I was able to tolerate the accent. Chris Evans does a nice job of playing the unlikeable rich and spoiled grandson even though he only seems to show up for the last third of the film. Michael Shannon, and Christopher Plummer are always impressive and are solid in their limited screen time, but Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette seem almost non-existent. I had a little trouble with Detective Blanc adopting Marta as a sort of Dr. Watson, and Marta's illness for lying seems a little too convenient for the story, but everything else about the screenplay and editing is so tight that I was able to overlook those two items as me just nitpicking. Definitely check out this movie, it's one of the best films I've seen in 2019."
243,"Is so bad that i want to leave the cinema after 20 minutes. Poor acting, poor script and very predictable."
244,"This film is just awful. It's just really boring. Didn't enjoy it at all and what is going on with Daniel Craig? His voice/accent is just terrible.
I would not recommend this film."
245,"Knives Out is entirely built around a pretty clever twist that comes early own. Once that's out, it slowly putters out of ideas until dragging itself back to the mansion where all is revealed ... to be an average episode of Murder She Wrote.Editing, cinematography and acting is all top notch throughout. But bent on delivering its one twist and nothing more, the story has left the characters without fleshing any of them out. Everyone is such a paper-thin stereotype that quite a while it feels inevitable they'd eventually turn out to be something more but instead they all end up being just as completely one-dimensional as they first appeared. Poorly written characters also ruin heavy-handed attempts to say something useful about immigration and privilege."
246,"I don't know what motivates the people who give this a 10/10 review or claim that it is the best movie ever. To be honest the movie is below average, and I found it more annoying than entertaining.
Daniel Craig's accent is ridiculous and he can't do comedy, although in fairness to him the attempts at comedy in the film are universally poor.
I was bored/irritated. Wait to see it at home."
247,"One of the worst crime movies ever.
Terrible acting, specially by Daniel Craig, who fails totally with his on-and-off accent.The plot does nothing to help this boring faliure."
248,"Just watched Knives Out, What a disappointment! Ive seen better episodes on ""Murder She Wrote"". What a waste of talent, time and money. Not funny at all, just a benign movie. Don't waste your money."
249,"Film looks good. Great cast. Intriguing at the start. Humorous. Interesting feel. But then I got confused. Was it a comedy, a thriller? A whodunnit? Then the story got a bit slap stick. Then I got excited. I was waiting for the sucker punch. The intelligent twist. But it never came. The last act was like they run out of money and had to wrap up the filming fast. The story ending was dumbed down. The reasons laughable. The ending weak.This film had promise but failed to deliver. All the fake high review scores will high this though. It is a watchable Sunday afternoon film. That's all. An anti-climax."
250,"The trailer is a lot more fun than the movie. it's like ""murder on the orient express"". if you liked that, you'll like this. chris evans might have a career after super hero life. he's pretty good here."
251,"'Knives Out' was written and directed by Ryan Johnson, the man behind films like 'Looper' and 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. I have my problems with The Last Jedi, but I can't rate a film based on a directors earlier film.Let me start with what I didn't like. This isn't your normal run of the mill who done it. The first act you learn something very vital to the plot and from there you don't feel much tension until the third act. With that in mind, my friends and I were still glued to the screen trying to piece together everything that was going on. It in the end was a bit predictable, but this didn't ruin the experience for me. The other thing I really didn't care for was Johnson's use of politics. Now I'm not a very political person, but he uses this to make some characters look ""evil"". I didn't see it when I first watched the film. I was very surprised he even added it in the script, but after thinking about it, he used it as a tool to make characters look more sinister. It's understandable why, but you can write characters to be hated without being political. I even laughed at one of the jokes that was said during this scene until I realized he was actually making a jab at people who think that way. But again, I'm reviewing the film - not people's political views.Now what I liked. The acting was phenomenal across the board. Everyone was a stand out to me except for actor Jaeden Martell (Lieberher). He was previously known for his role as Bill in 2017s 'IT'. He does the best he can with what he is given but he really isn't in the movie, his character just sits around on his phone like me writing this review. I wish I could commend every performance in the film but we would be here all day. My two stand outs would be Chris Evans and Toni Collette. There was also a fun cameo by Frank Oz which was great. This film also has a great fresh style and direction. The way he opens the film really made me cheese. The way he wrote the film was also great. The little clues he gives you throughout were very clever and it kept me on the edge of my seat, literally. The film was also very funny; I was very surprised on how much comedy was in it.Ryan Johnson's 'Knives Out' was a great film with fantastic acting! The story was engaging with a satisfying ending! It was a great time at the movies and I recommend checking this one out. It's no masterpiece, but this gets me excited for what new and engaging stories Johnson has up his sleeves - just stay away from 'Star Wars'.Final verdict: 7.5 / 10That's my 2 cents!Alex Bioni"
252,"The feeling washed over me of just how nasty the film actually was. It is both literary poison and too obsessed with getting good grades to get its hands dirty, bridging the polarities with an aloof and misanthropic superiority. It wants us to hang it on the fridge. Problem is the effect is more like a brother hitting the other then crying he was hit back. The film takes Trump America and splits it with left v right, within this dishonest frame of neutrality while his agenda couldn't be more clear. Of course, he's too passive-aggressive to be forthright. Then the patriarchs epiphany is as if Scrooge lost his mind; but even Scrooge stopped short handing Cratchit his fortune settling on giving him a duck. Today the artistic acts of millionaires must be greater because money is twice as shameful. So it's about capital and globalization. The transfer of power is societal and economic and race is a funnel of that, a symptom, a copout, an excuse. She becomes Queen. The world is now a different guard--now this could be effective as do you break the code and go with rage the hyperbole entertains and provokes. Poison is fun. We love a murder mystery. But I'm not sure Rian Johnson in his great position quite knows what he's trifling with, attacking the giant bodies of society through the frame of the erudite whites v underclass. Rather society is a disguise for his personal grudges and failures, then it all makes a little more sense. I think he's obsessed with internet culture. I think he's furious Star Wars fans came at him and he made this film as some grand revenge saying, 'I get the last laugh trolls.' Knives out, plainly. The film is then a tantrum from the very wealthy 'white male' he seems to be sending up, for how the others didn't take his blockbuster properly, so let's destroy the world. Its pettiness is a kindness I offer because the alternative is even worse, and that is its politics. Because if there is honesty to this piece it is that he belongs firmly within the family ranks, not directorially outside of them. He hides, per usual with his oeuvre, through deceptive frames, one-upping and manipulating us with narrative trickery doing anything he can to avoid giving us a sincere experience. We're just there for Rian's entertainment. As he's incapable of anything but frames (a common trap for the midwit) we are suddenly forced to see Johnson himself as the frame--the ultimate irony they don't quite learn is the more you hide the more we see you. So the director as moral arbiter hides in the 'statement', its politics and the personal are so fused, they are echoes, holograms, projections of the other, then relishing hurting wicked people can only be an act of artistic sadism, same as Plummer. Then, the film's dishonesty is it never questions he was a lousy father who raised these very kids he's chosen to punish. See the indignation of the brother speaking of the sister: ""Self-made? She had a million dollar loan"" inadvertently damns Johnson who goes with no self-reflection, mercy or pity at all within the mud-flinging. Constantly it's saying they don't deserve it. They botched it. They didn't earn it. Did you, Rian?"
253,Guy has NO BUSINESS ever making another film. GARBAGE.
254,"To be honest, I enjoyed this movie a lot in the cinema. In other words, this film has a nice rhythm in narrating. But also explodes the secret in this film. I wanna especially talk about the fun part closing to the ending, Captain America contributes his brilliant comedy talent. In order to avoid spoiler, I decided to skip this plot. I like the way the director tells the story, And the cabbage-like way of telling it, holding our attention. AND, I really like this shot--the heroine holding a cup which writes three short sentences vowing his sovereignty."
255,"When the millionaire writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead at home, the police investigate his apparent suicide together with the famous private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who was mysteriously hired by someone interested in finding if Harlan was killed. They interview the dysfunctional family members and the servants that lived or worked with Harlan in his mansion but when his testament is opened, the investigation presents twists and surprises.""Knives Out"" is an entertaining but overrated film in the style of Agatha Christie. Benoit Blanc is a kind of Sherlock Holmes and the cast is excellent. The screenplay begins without any character development and the viewer learns the characters along the investigation. Consequently the beginning is a little boring. But it is worthwhile watching this film without expecting the hype around. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Entre Facas e Segredos"" (""Between Knives and Secrets"")"
256,"A very well crafted film, but contains a plot hole so big that ruins the whole film. Earlier when talking to Harlan, marta tells him that because of the morphine, he will die in 10 minutes. But later, at 8 am Ransom gives same dose to fran and when at 10 am, after 2 hours, marta arrives, fran is still alive. She confesses the truth to save her. Now this much big mistake is not good for a murder mystery."
257,"It potential for being a really good movie! But sadly it isn't. The characters are very ""black & white"", no one has a layered personality, they are all just how they seem at first. Everyone are uppermost unpleasant people, except the old lady and the helpers ofc.
But now the real deal breaker: no even halfway through the movie you know who the killer is. I mean ofc. It is not the kind main character who it is supposed to look like it is. The police tells what happened through the night of the murder, the young Martha hears the dogs 03:00, when Hugh comes back at the day of the testimony opening, they go wild again. I mean if that isn't a giveaway I don't know what is. And if you didn't get there they make it completely obvious with the grandmother who says ""is you again Hugh?"" (Well she uses his second name, but can't remember it right now). When the detective at the end reveals what really happened it sure is a good and unusual thing that happened, but when you already know so early in the movie who it was, you just feel like the hour and a half in-between are wasted time. The actors and especially the main role where REALLY good actors, but if the movie is that poorly written they can only do so much. The ""funny scenes"" were also just to planned, you could feel the punchlines coming from miles away, before they even happened cause they just weren't that clever, and felt really unnatural.
In the defense of the movie, it maybe just ruined it a little cause I saw it in German dub. I plan to see the movie again in English and with a friend who hasn't seen it, to see how they feel about it. And then I will revisit, and update my critic."
258,Starts of good but then just becomes boring ..I found myself looking at my watch alot . Predictable NOTING NEW . Better to wait for it on a free streaming site
259,Buncha salty Star Wars fanboys didnt like TLJ so they think he can never make a good movie again.No matter. Glad to see people with brains are seeing the film and giving it the marks it deserves. The movie is fantastic and a thrill from start to finish. Tons of twists and turns and smartly written. Go see it. And then give it a good review here so intelligent filmmaking can prevail.
260,"Another disappointment from Rian Johnson, this movie was so badly written and acted, I'm glad I used my AMC A-List to see this bc I would have demanded a refund!"
261,"Had potential, mildly entertaining but it lacked the witty tongue in cheek humour one expects from this type of film. Very slow, very flat and Daniel Craig's performance was cringeworthy, he just couldn't pull off the role and it seemed forced and unbelievable. I think all the reviews raving about how funny this film is are from people that haven't actually seen it. All round it was disappointing and lacking something."
262,About two hours to long constant while people bad illegals great. If the nurse properly did her job the guy would have survived plus later something that should have taken just ten minutes to kill had the person still alive near two hours later. Of course if nurse actually read the bottles like any true professional should when dealing with drugs instead of going by feel he'd be dead or perhaps she'd have questioned it and found out everything. Also didn't care for the guy giving this nurse who was only in his life late everything because his family needed to earn it on their own. Thought it would be good but it's a sleep through movie should have stayed away once I saw the hack was involved.
263,Plot does twist and turn which is fun. Daniel Craig accent is horrible.
264,"Slow convoluted plot well acted and beautifully photographed but frankly boring and badly written nonsensical with pretentious political overtones
Never reaches the edge of your seat feeling or The Who done it moment of wonder"
265,"First of all, this so-called ""Knives Out"" might just be a goofy remake of ""Gosford Park (2001)"", even all the characters were almost alike. But the 2001 movie is more original, this 2019 one is so mediocre and generic. From 2001 to 2019, there are so many movies, screenplays, scenarios and plots that the screenplay writer(s) could borrow, steal and copycat into their ""Knives Out"" script. So~~~
The big magnetic disk of knives was copycatted from GOT's throne. The boring, formulaic and deadbeat humorless dialog, the storyline, the scenarios and the plot were heavily copycatted from those BBC's ""Masterpiece"" and ""Mysteries"" dramas, most were written, scripted and adapted from a bunch British housewives kitchen writers with poor logic and reasoning. Then,
The two police detectives were extremely poor cast, one clown, the other one, a greenhorn. They didn't look and act like seasoned plain-clothe detectives. There's no way these two guys could even be qualified as entry-level uniformed patrol cop, albeit for being senior plain-clothe detectives. It's a joke and insult to the police system.
Daniel Craig's role in this movie is the biggest joke, totally unnecessary, albeit another wrong cast, but since the screenplay writer(s) of this heavily copycatted movie needed to harvest all the roles of those existing movies and their existing screenplays so readily available to them when they wrote their script for ""Knives Out"", they simply could not include those obvious, already-there free chows, so they just copied everything available and threw into their mix.
Another character borrowed and capycatted from those typical BBC British detective crap, so-called DCI, detective inspector or some other titles.
When two American detectives investigated a suspicious murder case and questioned all the family members one by one, you think a civilian P.I. would be allowed to sit nearby those two low I.Q. American police detectives? And what's the purpose of asking him to speak with a southern accent?
All the family members in this farce were like cartoon's caricatures with dramatic exaggerated acting, talking, facial expressions, gestures....none of them looked natural and realistic enough, just gave a strong impression that they were trying very hard to mimic those characters in BBC's ""Mysteries"" and ""Masterpiece"".
Spent so much money, signed up so many Hollywood talents, but ended up so inferior if compared to ""An Inspector Calls (2015)"". Just don't know how and why so many viewers are so excited with high praises. I rest my case."
266,"Rian Johnson must be seething that he didn't make the singular Spanish ""Help"" a Black one given that, a year after KNIVES OUT hit theaters, we'd have a pandemic (closing all theaters) followed by a political uprising of African Americans, making the whole ""Undocumented Worker"" issue... which owns 51% of the story-line here... as dated as the Sony Walkman, leg-warmers and bellbottoms...And Johnson has successfully resurrected the All-Star Cast Whodunnit, including Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and Michael Shannon. But in the olden-times, they would be playing rich, white, crooked culprits who are also eclectic, darkly-humorous, interesting and intriguing enough to create an entire story around. But as noted in, ironically, another review featuring Michael Shannon (THE SHAPE OF WATER): Antagonists are no longer people who do bad things, but simply, bad people...From one pivotal argument concerning illegal aliens breaking the laws of American-only America, the already obvious message of KNIVES OUT becomes far too clear, and the aforementioned cast merely serves to back up the most heated side of that debate, hardly having anything to do with the Mystery at hand or fleshing out their roles in it...Only Daniel Craig, as a cocky Southern private-detective, and Ana de Armas, as dead millionaire Mystery writer Christopher Plummer's trusted nurse and household maid, have anything to do with how things not only pan out but... following Craig's overlong ""finally explaining the murder"" diatribe... ultimately turn out...That's if you don't include the entire third-act finally providing Chris Evans his second-star status; he begins a sort of likeable anti-rich rich jerk who eventually provides the preachy agenda even more unbearably preachy wordplay...And one of the most banal plot-points involves the maid's reaction to lying, making an extremely important character even more of an agenda with a pulse. And hardly even that. Ana de Armas is merely a pair of pretty pouty-lips here... Leaving the best character to be the least important...LaKeith Stanfield plays a local detective who would have failed at solving the case had the quirky Daniel Craig not been hired, and his job here is to ground a possible crime that writer/director Rian Johnson seems to have created to reshape/end all Cinematic Mysteries... But unlike this down-to-earth lawman, KNIVES OUT needs some serious grounding.""Why was I hired?"" Craig's Benoit Blanc desperately asks Stanfield's Lieutenant Elliott. Probably the most logical question raised all along. And like so much else here, without either a logical or halfway satisfying answer/conclusion."
267,"I cannot believe. It was so predictable.
From the start, their conversation while she was giving him his medication i knew what was gonna happen, and that he would cover her for ""poisoning"" him, then the maid in that warehouse, that guy being the person who set police station on fire... Like, come on guys...
And God, Daniel Craig's accent...ugh so irritating
I don't understand how it has such high rating when even the story's not that good, plus there's so much better movies with lowest rating who are so underrated. Shame..."
268,"After reading reviews I thought this would be a fun return to the murder mystery genre. But it just fell flat.I really dont understand the hype around Rian Johnson.
His Star Wars episode was terrible and destructive to the franchise but I went into this film thinking that this might be more his style given his past work on Looper and Brick (which were ok, though a little overrated).
I was wrong.Decidedly average film from an over hyped film maker."
269,Wow so disappointed in this movie. Like watching clue but in slow motion. Two thumbs down
270,"30 minutes into movie and I'm playing with my phone.
Sub par acting. Terrible accents.
A tonne of makeup.
Lacking realism to say the least.
Trying way to hard with camera angles.
Cluedo...but way way more boring.
Colonel Mustard in the library with a candlestick.
Maybe it will improve after 30 minutes. Can't say.
Better things to do."
271,"A great whodunit? I don't know about all that. No spoilers here, but you know exactly whodunit at the very beginning of the film- it's just the story evolves around that information, adding convoluted plot twists involving a couple other characters. The trailer makes it seem like it's some deep mystery up until the end when in reality you know exactly how the murder happens within the first 30 minutes of the film and very little changes, except the story becomes unnecessarily complicated as it progresses (they had to fill 2 hours somehow). Plenty of pointless political commentary provided as well, with the scales tipped heavily in favor of Leftist ideals, needlessly injecting opinions from the filmmakers about how Republicans are Nazis, and other lies. So edgy...so woke! What an over-hyped waste of 2 hours."
272,"A somewhat-watchable mystery/comedy. Frankly it was an effort to finish this. I had mostly lost interest with 20 minutes left to go, and my patience wasn't rewarded.First of all, the plot is completely implausible. It forces a suspension of disbelief. This is a dark film, which takes a particularly dim view of the wealthy, and perhaps even with white-colored Americans. There's a nasty racist joke at the very beginning about Italians.I guess my biggest disappointment was the ending. It wasn't much of a reveal.Decent performance from Daniel Craig in something other than a James Bond movie. The lead actress is cute but I'm not totally sure if she had quite enough presence for the role.Good rainy-day movie."
273,After hearing the reviews I was ready for an amazing movie. This is not it. It is boring and is one of those subverting expectations movies.. where every 10 minutes a new shock happens. This makes for a disjointed movie but not a good one. You can tell from the cast that the liberal elite wanted to make this a great movie but it is clear no one knows what that is anymore. Rent Clue.
274,Terrible and unfunny. I don't really get why this guy is allowed to direct movies.
275,2 hours and 10 minutes of watching someone puke isn't my idea of a good move.
276,"Beautifully shot and the old house was a fantastic set but the story was confusing, hokey and ridiculously boring with a final twist that was so drawn out it felt painful trying to get to the end. Watching Daniel Craig struggle through his fake Kentucky accent along with Chris Evans playing a villain was bad casting. They are both type-cast in their roles as Bond and Captain America and it just didn't work. The rest of the cast, although big stars, were incredibly unlikable and it made it hard to care about anyone in the film except the puking Ana De Armas and Christoper Plummer, who is always awesome. I think it's safe to say I'm just not a fan of Rian Johnson movies."
277,"It's an ok movie.You watch it once, you'll forget it in a few months.The characters are a little too cartoonish and simple, the plot is weak and simple as well.The Latina girl is portrayed as way too nice throughout the movie...we see everything coming from 2 miles away. No depth of character. Just ""nice and obedient""...takes no decisions and just follows the wave of the story which conveniently works for her.This movie deserves a 6.5/10 at best."
278,"1st - Daniel Craig sets the ridiculous pace of this absurd movie by sounding exactly like Foghorn Leghorn.
2nd - One of the main characters pukes if she lies? What? Instead of walking away she manages to struggle to find a bowl, a vase, a cup... and stay to talk to whomever chooses to push her for the truth. Which she doesn't tell. Really?!
3rd - This storyline would have made a mediocre TV movie.
4th - If I wasn't pinned in the corner of the theater I would have walked out! Don't waste you time and money."
279,"Murder mysteries are formulaic. You set the scene, fill it with the requisite sub-plots and characters to sustain curiosity, confuse and generally lead the audience up multiple and erroneous paths. Punctuate the storyline with revelations, flashbacks, re-enactments and twists and conclude with a satisfying reveal all.
All that is left is the dramatisation and the delivery.
Sounds simple enough.
Where this latest contribution struggles, stumbles and falls in a heap is the the casting. It needed actors. Ironically, there is no shortage here but the ones who can act be they stars or has-beens are all in minor roles while the main players are wannabes or never-wases who are unproven or in some instances disproven in dramatic roles.
What were they thinking?"
280,"It's clear Ruin Johnson hasn't learned from his past mistakes and once again, has come up with a mediocre movie that is being protected by the media for being politically left leaning. The story put me to sleep, the characters left me yawning, and the ""twists"" were predictable. It's clear that people and ""critics"" are giving this good reviews because of the round headed baby's political views. This movie is absolute garbage and everyone should avoid this movie like the plague."
281,"This boring predictable rehash of an murder she wrote episode, is another social conditioning exercise disguised as entertainment. I gave it two stars instead of one because I like Christopher Plummer."
282,"I won't get into the social commentary the film is trying to convey. It just seems the ""mystery"" was an after thought and the agenda was the primary. I wanted a true mystery in Agatha Christie fashion but was let down. The acting is great and I did laugh but wait until it's on HBO."
283,"This movie is plot-centered. Character development is limited to what is necessary for establishing motivations and relationship dynamics among the characters. This is similar to a movie like Murder on the Orient Express, while I am not comparing the quality of the two movies.The little details explicitly shown or mentioned in the movie are paid off by the end. There are a few times when there's a bit of a question about someone acting out of character, but they're points that can be explained away.The big negative is the politics. One character development point involves the legal status of one character's family, so discussing that particular point is fair game. The grating yelling match about politics in the middle of the movie is not. It had nothing to do with the plot or motivations and took viewers out of the movie. But just hold on -- once it's over, the movie resumes.It's an entertaining movie with Daniel Craig again showing he can do a believable southern accent, if you can overlook the pointless political shouting."
284,"First of all, for people complaining about the rating/score: NOT EVERYONE LIKES THE SAME THING. Just because it's a score you don't agree with doesn't mean it's a conspiracy theory or botsNow onto the proper review.Like others have said the premise alone is simple and we've known it for ages because a that very simple premise is a board gameSadly all the star power in this movie can't save it from the cliche and plodding of the movie and it's pacingIf movies have to result to padding because they don't want such a short run time maybe they should suck it upThe wokeness  shocking considering the show is done by Roam Johnson who along with JJ Abrams have been ruining the Star Wars trilogy"
285,"Knives Out is a murder-mystery movie in the key of old-fashioned Agatha Christie or Edgar Wallace novels and their cinematic adaptations throughout the sixties and seventies of the last century. This sounds worse than it is because a movie without an overdose of special effects that goes back to the basics is actually quite refreshing. Elderly audiences will adore this movie and it might as well introduce younger audiences to this almost forgotten type of cinema.This thriller works well for numerous reasons. The actors and actresses are veterans and talented youngster who complement one another perfectly. Young Cuban actress Ana de Armas delivers the goods as good-hearted caretaker who ends up mingled in a crime. Veteran Christopher Plummer is excellent as eccentric author who despises his own family. The diversified Daniel Craig convinces as mysterious investigator who tries to put all the pieces of the puzzle together.The locations and settings are simple but very efficient in this movie. Most parts of the film take place in a gorgeous mansion and even though the architecture and landscapes look splendid, the tight rooms and sinister decorations give the film a gloomy vibe. The few scenes that are filmed away from that location offer some refreshing diversity in form of small appartments, charming downtown areas and rural restaurants.The plot obviously comes around with a few twists and turns. However, those don't come as big surprises if you are familiar with this type of storytelling. Another minor issue is that too many details are revealed rather quickly through flashbacks. This movie would have been even better if it had given its audience the time and occasion to come to its own conclusions and put the pieces of the puzzle together.Still, Knives Out offers one hundred thirty minutes of old-fashioned but well-executed murder-mystery entertainment and convinces thanks to a solid plot, great locations and gifted actresses and actors. In addition to this, this film also offers some soial criticism by pointing out the egoism, greed and manipulation of the rich and the famous. If you want to know what kind of movies your parents or grand-parents enjoyed when they were younger, give this film a fair chance. Sometimes, going back to basics means advancing in the right direction."
286,"As the key character, the Latina nurse, Ana de Armas majorly under-acts whilst everybody else majorly overacts, particularly Don Johnson, Toni Colette and Jamie Lee Curtis. Chris Evans, the bad-boy grandson, seems to be channeling Rupert Everett.Writer/director Rian Johnson is clearly torn between homage to Agatha Christie and a send-up. If you're going to spoof Christie, you need to spoof one of her grander whodunits like MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. KNIVES OUT, with its gothic-ish country house setting, is more reminiscent of THE MOUSTRAP, Dame Agatha at her creakiest. The Sondheim-scripted THE LAST OF SHEILA (1973) was not good, but it wasn't as clunky as this.This is tosh - and really not 'quality' tosh. Mildly - very mildly - entertaining. After his Southern-fried piss-take on Poirot, it's gonna be hard to watch Daniel Craig back in his 007 tuxedo next year."
287,Yeah uh I spent valuable money because this movie looked good in the trailers. When I saw it i didn't like it at all. Very boring movie.
288,"Man watching this movie just reminds me of a lot of movies we have seen before ABSOLUTELY nothing new and it's so obvious who done it after 30 mins, Chris Evans done it but it's so boring I was gonna leave but stayed in case there was a good twist but no ..noting. sux really"
289,"Harlan Thrombury (Christopher Plummer ) has built an empire writing mystery novels. He is found dead in the morning of an apparent suicide by his nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) seemingly innocent and naive. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) a private investigator of mystery writer quality has been hired anonymously to investigate the incident as someone suspects foul play. During the interview process, we discover the events of the night in flashbacks. Everyone lied and had a motive. About 30 minutes into the film we discover who killed Harlan.The film has twists and clues as does any good mystery. Everyone was a quirky character. Harlan lived ""on a Clue Board"" and has written his family out of his will as they will not get a ""single red dime."" They need to grow on their own. If you love an entertaining old-style mystery you can't go wrong here.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity."
290,"I enjoyed parts of this movie, my husband and I love a good murder mystery and this one was decent!
But good gracious could we keep the self loathing, ""white privilege"" ideology at a minimum for a quick second!?... And this is coming from the daughter of a Mexican (former) illegal immigrant! I'm tired of the same narrative, it's getting old and it doesn't need to be slathered into every single aspect of our lives!"
291,"Everything in this movie is an Agatha Christie story ripoff, stem to stern. Totally unoriginal!"
292,I was captivated i enjoyed every bit of it. The plot was so misleading you will think you got the movie figured out but out of nowhere another factor comes up
293,KNIVES OUT borrows from countless other whodunit films that have come before it while still managing to put a fresh and original take on it. It's everything that's great about the genre with just the perfect amounts of satire and parody added for good measure.It's one thrill after the next. It's hilarious and a whole lot of fun. Don't try to figure it out yourself. Just enjoy the ride! Recommend.
294,"Hidden in the image of paying homage to the traditional British reasoning novels and movies, it is actually a wanton rebellion against this classic type. Such absurd settings and nearly naked political implications as a number of unreliable narrators plus an absolutely reliable narrator are rarely seen in hard core reasoning works."
295,"Knives Out was no great. I found it to be dull and just a bad mystery. The mystery gets lost right at the beginning until the very end. Plus the person who did it is so predictable it's just sad. When I saw Murder on the Orient Express I was always excited every second. It was fun to see the detective find clues to who did what. And the ending was even more exciting. This was just dry and had no clues. With a cast this amazing I was hopeful but everyone was pretty bad except Ana de Armas.
I wouldn't recommend. Watch Murder on the Orient Express instead."
296,"Basic subtext: Noble, virtuous hard working immigrant receives the inheritance that a bunch of undeserving, lazy, greedy, self-entitled, white people assumed they would be receiving. The inclusion of lots of avarice and infighting attempts to make you feel great about a father disinheriting his family. So much better that the help ends up with what the rich folks never deserved."
297,"I didn't like Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi but this is a clever little comedy/murder mystery with some interesting twists; Rian's brand of irreverent, postmodern humor works better here than in Star Wars, where winking at the audience while mocking characters and lore was noxious to the whole thing. The cast is great and efficiently delivers the required ping-pong of quips and zingers.See also the much darker (and superior) thriller/black comedy Sleuth with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, which probably served as one of the inspirations for this, starting with the setting, the secluded mansion of an eccentric mystery writer.7/10"
298,"Knives Out is a film in which Rian Johnson, formerly of Star Wars: The Last Jedi and Looper fame, redirects the main points of contention from his previous outings into a more suitable genre for his particular brand of directorial vision - a whodunit Agatha Christie-inspired murder mystery. As such, the less one knows about it - the better, but since this is a recommendation, perhaps the deal needs to be sweetened, before you are fully convinced that the film is worth your time. What follows will probably diminish your viewing enjoyment.
Featuring a star-studded cast, Knives Out spins a delightful web of intrigue surrounding the sudden death of the eldest member of the Thrombey family - Harlan, a writer and proprietor of a publishing company as well as vast amounts of wealth. Contentions arise concerning his will and the distribution of inheritance, as things usually go.Through a series of interviews with his decedents, one begins to paint a picture of the events that transpired on that very night. Said interviews are so cleverly bolstered by the films clever editing scheme, displaying just enough information to keep you interested, but reward you for being observant as well. One could go as far to say that part of the subtle humor of the film is a direct consequence of one paying attention to details and remembering what seemed to be insignificant red-herrings beforehand. It is honest to god fun to see Rian Johnson subvert and twist away in a genre that was built on exactly that ever-shifting foundation, rather than more generic linear narratives. The amount of foreshadowing and Chekhov's guns littered around is nothing short of amazing, whenever the guns do in fact go off in the third act.The film isn't without action, as everyone scrambles to uncover the truth, usually getting themselves caught in situations they'd rather not be in. There are thrills and suspense waiting around every corner, as you begin to believe you've finally got it and a new lead opens up unexpectedly from the unlikeliest of sources.
This is no less a product of the film's wonderful script, which features clever word-play galore, giving everyone a wonderfully fleshed out persona with its own unique quirks and still maintaining a level of realism in their depiction as real people. The performances also lend themselves nicely to the often quippy nature of every line of dialogue. Many battles of wit are held with a level of wordsmanship that leaves you laughing or shivering on a constant basis.The film even pays homage to the pieces of media that inspired the genre in some less that subtle ways; like the single-color attire everyone seems to wear and the wildly different personalities, reminiscent of Clue (1985) or the bearded sailor dummy referencing 1972's Sleuth, and many more.
The soundtrack is frankly very traditional, in the way that it plays it straight, by relying mostly on orchestral strings and short spirts of piano. It serves its purpose well in establishing tension whilst also maintaining this ever-present whimsy, but regretfully falls on the not-so-memorable side of things. A fitting score, but probably not something you would be listening to in your free time.An overall fantastic time with a film that wraps up nicely, accomplishing everything that it set out to do. If not one of the best original screenplays of the year, it is definitely one with heart and a good sense of humor. A wonderful murder mystery that keeps you asking questions and rewards you for noticing its intricate details in a way that nothing has done for quite some time. Rian Johnson shows his true talent in flamboyant display of filmmaking, that will keep you enamored until the very end. Watch it!"
299,"""Knives Out"" is a Crime - Drama movie in which we watch a detective trying to solve the mystery behind the death of a very famous Crime novelist who was found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday. From his children to his devoted staff everyone is a suspect.I enjoyed this movie very much because it was very interesting and had many great scenes. I also liked very much the plot and how it changed through time and the combination between plot twists and comedy made this movie even more interesting. The interpretations of Daniel Craig who played as Benoit Blanc, Ana de Armas who played as Marta Cabrera, Jamie Lee Curtis who played as Linda Drysdale and Chris Evans who played as Ransom Drysdale were simply amazing.Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Christopher Plummer's who played as Harlan Thrombey, LaKeith Stanfield's who played as Lieutenant Elliott and Michael Shannon's who played as Walt Thrombey. Finally, the direction which was made by Rian Johnson who is also the writer of this movie was very good and his hard work was obvious in the whole duration of the film."
300,"I believe if you're not guilty Only telling the truth can save you, just like what we saw in the movie. the story was perfect, I'm little obsessed with writing the dialogs during the watching movies and so it tooks something like 4 hours to watch whole movie with a lot of backward and forward to write down the dialogs. I believe the dialogs and the story was totally perfect. it is absolutely satisfied me. and one other thing that I should add is : this was one of the best performs of Daniel Craig that I have ever seen."
301,"This one is trying so much to be a Hercule Poirot type of mystery. It is not that it is bad but it feels a little off at times. Craig's character jumps to conclusions easily, the members of the family are full of stereotypes, the plot twists are somehow predictable.It is a good try, but if they want to make a franchise with Craig's character, they have to try more."
302,"Well, with all the hype and publicity going on right now about Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"", it's safe to say that I expected to see something much more captivating than this."
303,"Really bad. So bad I created an imdb account to spread the word. A strange and bizarre waste of time. The plot was so bad even with some good actors the movie was still a miss. It was half serious and half trying to be funny but missing both marks terribly. If it were free on TV, I would rather watch antique's roadshow."
304,Full of extreme political stereotypes and propaganda.
305,"It's truly a good movie, a pleasant to watch and have some good times, but not good as ""a mystery whodunit"". Everything is good apart from the ""twist "" and the story was clear halfway, its just a good entertaining.... that's all!"
306,Feel I must be living in another world. Despite some good acting and occasional moments of fun this quickly developed into a sluggish bore. Relieved when it was over and didn't have to listen to Daniel Craig's drawl any longer. Staggered to see it got such positive reviews though heartened by the fact that my partner had similar view.
307,"Oké wow if your making a movies based on a board game and just role the dices to get you to the next level... Well this is your movie.There are just random ""smart"" scenes pasted together to make a movie with more plot holes than a Swiss cheese. People who see the movie and find it amazing are the one who think they are smart (like playing the game) and the people who are disliking it are the one who quessed wrong (like in the game)It's just a over scripted movie of a director who can not make or write a movie a last attempt of his brain to proof that he can write and direct movies... It was boring"
308,"The movie was below par, the story was so predictable from the beginning. When you cast Chris Evans and give him a lesser screen time, it was obvious he is the antagonist. However, apart from my prediction, the story was so boring, non - humorous, less intriguing and dragging screenplay.
This movie is either over hyped or certain critics lost their taste for good cinema."
309,"After a really strong setup the movie falls apart after the first act and never regains its footing. The focus is lost amid several twists and turns, some predictable, some nonsensical, which is exactly what a twist shouldn't be. The direction is good, though there's a little too much bathos and again a loss of focus on the plot, which isn't the worst thing, since the plot falls apart. The movie feels about an hour too long and towards the middle you just want it to be over. It's a real shame, because it started so promising."
310,"Knives Out is an okay movie. There are so many haters of this film rating it 1-stars just because they don't like Rian Johnson and what he did to the Star Wars: Last Jedi apparently and a lot of others who rate it 10-stars to revoke the 1-star ratings. But the movie is basically ok. And I'm sad to acknowledge it as I really, really wanted to like it. I mean c'mon look at the cast!Knives Out is ok for basic entertainment when you don't have anything else to do and just want to have fun at the movies but it has soooo many plot holes and insults to the viewer that I can't just close my eyes on them.You know there's this saying that if you start explaining the joke then it's not funny. It's about this movie exactly! They do so much explaining that your brain hurts. It's basically an insult because I kinda sat there and felt that there shouldn't have been so much explaining. I mean sometimes you gotta trust the audience. That they'll get it. This is either inconfidence in yourself or in the audience. There's at least like 15 minutes of the movie explaining itself and what's going on but they could've done it in a more subtle way with hints, looks and feels. Not with words. The movie has so many shifts and turns that you kinda look at it funnily. And not only the plot turns but also the movie and genre itself. It's almost like it's not as self-aware.This might be one of the very few times that I'll say I didn't like the acting in an American film. They all are great actors and Americans are somehow natural at this but this film didn't even require a whole lot of range from them. It relies on its script of a ""whodunit"" and beautiful cinematography and scenery to carry out the film. Actors were acting like in a play or smth. Do you remember those theatrical experience where acting is over-the-top? When it's just too much? There's a scene at the end where a man is trying to bribe a policeman by waving money in the air, in front of them, when everybody's looking. That's zero subtlety. You feel like you're getting spoon-fed smth that could've been done in a more serious fashion.When you turn 180 degrees, you're basically back at the same spot Rian. Quit turning.
It's a solid OK"
311,Knives out had the potential to be a very good movie. It has a great cast and it is very well acted. The story though was shallow and the only thing funny was Daniel Craig's accent. The pace is slow and the misdirection to me was obvious. I enjoy mysteries and had this one this partially figured out right after Blanc's interview with Marta. Rian Johnson once again tried to outsmart himself with poor humor and lazy writing. I think his head is swollen from Star Wars and the controversy it created.
312,"Wow I mean I expected it to be good but wow.
This movie has you guessing until the very end and subverts your expectations to the fullest.
The humor is so good and classy.
CHRIS EVAS wow is he good in this movie and it's so fun to see him playing other characters than CAP (witch I love) but he shows off his acting skills like never before.
Daniel Craig is amazing in his role and is truly a stand out of the movie.
All the cast is amazing and the new actors we see like Ana de Armas show great talent.
Ryan Johnson really does it well after receiving so much hate for Star Wars the last Jedi (that I personally liked) he shows how good of a director and story teller he is.
Over all a must watch, and one of the best movies of the year."
313,"What acting? With the exception of Christopher Plummer, the acting was lack luster and painful."
314,It's boring . Maybe a home watch but surely not a theatre watch.
315,"Another hyped up whodunit that didn't deliver. Another 'Murder on the Orient Express', great cast, great concept but boring and disappointing. Overall, not impressed."
316,This movie is for dumb people. Way over rated and just silly.
317,"Terrible movie, poor plot.Daniel Craig seriously miscast.And his accent, awful. A lot of good actors on show in a woeful movie. Stick to what you're good at,and this ain't it."
318,Tries way too hard to be funny. The writer attempts to create quirky and interesting characters and fails miserably. If you wanted to make a funny film you should've used funny actors. Every attempt at comedy fails in this unoriginal.on't hold it.
319,"The movie starts really high. The presentation of characters is superb. Entertaining (and needed) exposition mixed with funny dialogue and great performances, ultra natural. But after 15 great minutes, the real protagonist Marta (Ana de Armas) takes center stage. The movie promised by the trailer (""Clue"" but in a movie, and funnier), just wasn't anymore. She was the victim's nurse. The victim was the patriarch of a family, owner of millions and murdered the night of his 85 birthday. The supporting character is detective Blanc (Daniel Craig), motivated by a curious anonymous contract to investigate the crime.From there, the focus is on Marta and her connection with the family and the crime, and the detective trying to unveil the truth, leaving the rest of the cast in the periphery. The film's pace suffers. Even with great writing, the story just gets more conventional. Chris Evan's character, Ramson, gets a bigger part after an hour, but by that time, the movie just had lost the intensity. It ends up being dense. A mix of repetitive ""investigation scenes"", good jokes, bad jokes, little twists and bigger twists, and it turns awkward.With a lack of emotional weight and skin deep social commentary, the solved mystery doesn't satisfy.The idealization of the minorities (in this case, Latin-American), creating a character almost impossibly virtuous without any defect, felt clearly condescending."
320,"This movie is like a Hitchcock movie but funnier. Rian Johnson did a bad job making The Last Jedi, but Knives Out... hell of a movie. Watch it."
321,"When I see IMDb top 250, and sort by date... it's saddening to see. Super hero movies. Super hero movies. Since when this became a thing? I have no interest for Marvel characters in spandex, no matter how ""mature"" the storytelling is. Yeah I've seen a few, and they didn't deserve their score, while some were ok.Okay there's Bollywood movies too, but I feel they get higher rating than deserved also because India is a massive (and growing) country, and Indians vote their native movies. National pride sort of thingBUT this movie. Good old style story telling, a real whodunnit, with humor and some social commentary sprinkled on top. But the main emphasis is on the Agatha Christie style murder mystery. It's like playing the boardgame Clue, trying to figure out the killer, but in movie form. Great entertainment, so well written.Only thing I didn't like was Daniel Craig's accent, I mean it was a bit overdone. Everyone else seemed realistic, and this character seemed like a caricature. I like Daniel Craig in Casino Royale, Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and bunch of other films. His acting was good here too, but I wish he just did his natural accent.SPOILERS AHEAD:Small other criticism, I did find the ending a bit implausible, even an experienced nurse would check the labels when the stuff she's giving is potentially lethal. And not just trust the hand-feel of the liquids. Besides, how different can two bottles of liquid really feel, if their size and amount of liquid is the same?SPOILERS ENDAnyway, it was a small thing... otherwise one of best movies I've seen in many years. And deserves it's high score (unlike those superhero movies)About the rumored Knives Out 2, writing a story as good as this twice in a row... seems unlikely. But hope they succeed, definitely interested"
322,"Exceptionally well written and directed. The editing and shot compositions tell the the story stunningly. This is unpredictable. Twists are traditional in a whodunnit story like this. We expect them and try to nut them out them out beforehand, in order to outwit the film. But here, that pursuit is a little more difficult :)Rian thankfully destroyed the kiddie film aspect of the Star Wars franchise by creating a long overdue Star Wars film designed for adults, then this! Thank you Rain.Well acted by all, with a jolly score, 10/10 for this masterpiece."
323,"The story spoiled itself,so it doesn't have any excitement to watch , because you know most of the secrets and the other secrets are predictable .(i just wrote about some disadvantages."
324,"This was a pretty good movie in the Poirot and Mrs. Marple style. However, the detective was Daniel Craig, and his awful, phony, amateurish accent was so bad it made me want to pull my hair out. He needs to stick with playing James Bond, where his poor acting skill is partially covered by the continuing action scenes. I can't begin to understand why Craig was cast in such a key role. Well, he blew it, embarrassingly so. It could have been much better with Dilbert cast in that role. Seriously, Daniel Craig?"
325,"I told myself I wouldn't watch any more Rian Johnson films, but ended up watching this anyway. Go figure.Anyway, for a whodunnit to work there has to be a sense of mystery, or paradox, you have to wonder, 'who did it' when anyone could have, and there is no clear explanation. This movie kind of has that in the first half-hour, only for Rian to abruptly reveal everything that happened, and spoilers, it is a suicide. Once he reveals this, the 'whodunnit' pretense completely falls apart and the movie just becomes the story of a Spanish woman inheriting a fortune and dealing with greedy manipulative family members. Sure, you know there's going to be some future developments, but nothing can change the fact that the death was a suicide and then we know that none of the other family members could have 'done it'. Therefore there really isn't that much mystery. Rian shoots himself in the foot once again with his labored cleverness.Side note: Pretty good cast here. Avengers: Endgame convinced me that Chris Evans couldn't act to save his life, but now this movie showed me otherwise. Maybe he was just playing himself. I'm glad Daniel Craig had that absurd accent because it made the movie more entertaining. Also some of the jokes were funny."
326,"This movie is another example of a trailer REALLY making the movie look good and then having The movie pretty much be a Dud. The acting was horrible(Don Johnson, seriously buddy time to hang it up.) They revealed the killer half way through the movie, which made the rest of the movie watching everyone else trying figure it out. It was almost predictable when the old man left all his belongings to his nurse. I have never watched any of Daniel Craig's Bond movies but I certainly hope he's better in them then he is in this train wreck. I only gave it three stars because it was cool to see Chris Evans play a jerk. Two hours of my life that I won't get back with this one"
327,"I was searching good murder investigation Genre and saw Knives out with 8/10 IMDB rating so I decided to watch.
I am very specticle how shall I review and rate this movie! It seems to me the ending Half of the movie right after the ""will reading"" is Directed/written by some different Team...
the first half of the movie is SERIOUS about investigation and the Plot seems strong but after few twist and turns the writer got carried away and kept looping audiances with more twist and turns until to the point where I felt like lets skip to the end.""Knives out"" feels like CAMEO of classic 1985 ""CLUE"" ( ONE HOUSE MURDER MYSTRY with ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO COMICAL MOVIE)Knives out could also be inspired by some Episode of TV series THE COLUMBOanyways I didn't enjoy the movie very much! script is also weak,"
328,First 80% -85% of the movie was literally a day time episode of Murder She Wrote (think that's what the series was called) remaing 15% was decent Sherlock Holmes slightly inspired drama making it somewhat worth it in the end.
329,The raving plaudits for this undercooked whodunnit indicates to me that no one reads mystery novels anymore.
330,A twist of the classic Christie-esque whodunnit with a great cast. I hope there Will be more movies starring detective Benoit Blanc. Just do it with the same professional crew!!
331,Funny characters in a story line done to 'death'. Some good twists vas expected.
332,"Nicely shot, but it's just sooo unnecessarily long. I didn't particularly like any of the characters either, and I found Daniel Craig's accent a bit distracting.Stick with Poirot!"
333,Not all it's cracked up to be.I was expecting more of a classic cluedo style movie adaptation but it was lacking something to hold my attention
334,"Knives Out kept me interested to the bitter end and just like a big bowl of my favorite ice cream, after I finished it all and licked the spoon, I wondered what the great appeal was all about after experiencing the same let down time and time again.It is a dark comedy and the cast alone is what makes Knives Out worth watching. Is it a great classic film? No, by no stretch of the imagination is it a great classic film. Is it a memorable film? No, I watched it just last week and I am already having difficulty recalling any favorite actor/actress in any special scenes or clever dialogue.I am though happy to be able to say that I saw this film and I can now with a clear conscience express my singular opinion of the film even with its stellar cast as a simple ""meh""."
335,"Knives Out is an interesting take on a murder mystery. I will admit that the comedy is not completely on point, but it's still fun anyway. The mystery is definitely on point though! I love the whole over-the-top delivery of the story.It is an overall good, light-hearted movie you can watch if you just want to be entertained. Agatha Christie would definitely approve!"
336,"This is a short review, because I read other critics make most of my points.This movie could have been great. Great cast, decent action, nice backdrop, great cinematography. I thought I might give it 8/10 until I saw the last act.The last act is so flawed, it ruined the movie for me. The biggest problem is that every one of the characters turns out to be just like the prejudices you are supposed to hold against them upon the first glance. People are just good or (most of them) evil. The detective turns out to be a mentalist and just knows things.The end also makes the victim and the protagonist look like terrible people on closer inspection. This would be OK, if the viewer wasn't supposed to believe them to be the ""nice ones""."
337,"Like the title said, Daniel Craig was really good in this movie. chris evans and armas made it kinda hard to watch and made it all seem long and dragged out. It looks like a rather amazing cast on paper but it just feels like it isn't playing to it's strengths and some of these rather secondary characters shows a lot of personality that you'd expect, but then seem to fade away in the story. having someone like LaKeith Stanfield in the movie and only using him to ask stupid questions, it just seem like such a waste of talent. It's not a bad movie and it does achieve somewhat what it tried to. would probably rate it somewhere between a 6 and 7."
338,"This is one of the top rated film of the recent months.
I went into it with higher expectations.
True, it is funny and dark, with an engaging ensemble cast.
Daniel Craig's southern detective didn't really shine. None of the large suspected knives out-ers were likeable.
The one who shines is Anna de Armas, the young Cuban actress who played the maid.
The movie is entertaining but seems trying a bit too hard to prove the point."
339,"Words cannot express how horrible this movie is.
Watching paint dry is quicker & more interesting.
Bore yourself to death.
Worse Than Passing a Kidney Stone.
My compliments to anyone who managed to stay awake for the whole film. My sympathies too. The movie is so badly acted, so cheaply made and so boring that most people will be gently snoring 20 minutes in."
340,This movie was very hard to follow and never stopped throwing in more people and scenes that added confusing to the whole ordeal of sitting through it. I thought it would never end and get its conclusions. I wanted to get up and walk out.
341,"Casting and the picture (scenery) were the only good things. I could not focus on Daniel Craig's American accent and he seemed out of it too. Marta was made this incredible person with the best heart in the world, fighting all those mean white people.. I think the characters could've had more depth to them. Storyline was manic. The bad boy, outcast, the most obvious choice was the one who did it. I could say that the bits of the plot were unique but not very intriguing or shocking."
342,"The nurse actress is gorgeous, and the home is attractive, but all the characters are two dimensions, there were no surprises, and the politics get in the way of telling an interesting story."
343,"I don't even know where to begin. It's soo boring. The bad accent of Daniel Craigs, the girl who wommits when she lies, the underwelming performance of Chris Evans. The plot, the twists. Everything. I can't... I... no... the end."
344,"The trailers for this film led one to believe we were in store for a comedy. Funny it is not. Quirky maybe? And that's pushing it. It does fall into the realm of a ""who done it"", but given the list of actors I certainly expected a lot more. Virtually zero character development. Daniel Craig's role was completely miscast. His acting was pedestrian and his accent even worse. Save yourself some time and go find a copy of ""Clue"" from 1985."
345,"Unpopular opinion- this movie was not that great. I knew who the killer was the whole time! Maybe I'm a crime drama snob, so since this was a comedy also, it didn't impress me much. The main reason I watched was so I could admire Chris Evans in the cable knit sweaters, but his character ruined that for me 🙄"
346,One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. Very overrated. Not at all funny. Wish I would have not paid $4 to rent it. I wouldn't sit through it again if you paid me to.
347,I never knew Daniel Craig actually can act!The flow is a bit slow paced but the rhythm of the movie is top notch. Doesn't feel like 2 hours.
348,"If you've half a brain cell you'll guess the criminal long before the end. Huge cast, lacklustre plot and some truly horrific acting in places."
349,"Knives out is a typical murder-mystery movie. It is the first movie Rian Johnson made after Star Wars the Last Jedi, and that in itself is more puzzling than anything that you see in the movie.It is very classical in its approach: there is a murder; it is a mystery of who done it. The twist on the premise is that the murder is not actually a murder and we follow the investigation through the eyes of the perpetrator.I feel in a lot of ways similar emotion as when watching the Last Jedi. In theme, tone and subject these movies are obviously very different, but there is something distinctively Johnson-esque, to both of them. They are a re-telling in a Rian Johnson fashion of movies/tropes that we are familiar with (that lead to an end-result that is arguably underwhelming).For one thing all the ingredients are good or excellent. The actors are all great to the point where I regret not seeing more about them. The characters are somewhat stereotypical but that is expected from these types of movies. The set design is cool, it is a mix of quirky and gothic. There are callbacks to classical horror/thrillers, but it remains light and playful. The costumes are also very well made and are used to convey information efficiently. The cinematography is not anything groundbreaking, but I felt that there was an effort to emphasize the sets and the costumes and therefore the put forward the tone and the plot.The plot is Achilles Heel of the movie. Not that it is bad, but it is merely passable. For all the flair and ingenuity the movie displays it is rather bland. The plot has twists, it had turns. Some characters are charming, some characters are despicable. There not really any element that stands out.Also you don't really get anything form it. There is no moral, no metaphor. There is not really any kind of reflection on anything.
To be fair, there is a mention of politics in the film, and there might be some commentary on immigration or immigrants. But it is too subtle to be taken seriously. The political commentary the film has, is more evocative than definitive. It feels sneaky. It feels more like a way to ground the film or to do characterization rather than an honest take on the topic. There is one character that is alt-right, but it does not inform on his behavior or his motives. He is just alt-right.
There is no broader meaning to the film.In a way that was not what I was expecting from the movie, and it is not something the movie advertised. The feeling I have is that this movie, with everything that it is and that is does, could have been a quiet masterpiece. Instead it is rather prude, bland and frankly forgettable."
350,"I watched this due to the starry cast & Agatha Christie elements. It's a shame that many of the actors are given little to do with barely fleshed out characters..Toni Collette, Don Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis are all given short shrift. There's no great suspense or mystery and for me the solution was a bit dull. It was a nice movie to look at & had some funny moments..but not that gripping."
351,"The direction is great, the performances are wonderful, and the pace is mostly good. It is predictable in most aspects, and is heavily flawed, but accept the good with the bad and overall you get a smart keen movie. If I could I'd give it a 7.5."
352,"Benoit Blanc - you would think that a lead character with a strange accent would sound more like a Frenchman who draws escargo into the plot. Nope, this might be one of the best tung-in-cheek characters ever on the trail of a murder. There's Comedy afoot here but it is not realized immediately. In fact so many viewers are misled by Rian Johnson's plot that a lot of the reviews I have read here don't even realize the classic comedy put into this which is actually funnier than the all-star Murder By Death where Obi One Kanobe is a blind butler.When I started this film, I thought well an opening scene murder is not new. Then it seemed like it was a night mare of sorts. Then I got a Columbo twist as it seems too obvious who guilty and thought this was going to be a comedy more than mystery as Benoit Blanc appears befuddled despite obvious facts and guilt right in front of him. Then the twists come into play.The party on the night of the murder-suicide is replayed like layers of an onion several times in the film. Each time as it is unwound there is a different aspect of the party revealed. It's actually darned fine writing, a surprise to be sure. Could it have worked if there was another ending? Possibly, but this ending is so funny and a little twisted that the entertainment for this genre film is way above average.Folks here tend to look at the names in that cast and think that they should have been given better dialogue? Benoit Blanc gets some of the best humor lines ever in a film like this. When you make a comedy and disguise it by making it a mystery as well, you have to remember casts do not get a lot of great lines or acting in a comedy. So while handing out an Oscar for Best Supporting role in a Mystery film, you have to ask yourself why back ground characters would get great dialogue? Not gonna happen, though the caretakers role here is the best played. Daniel Craig proves he is great at subtle comedy as Benoit Blanc.When all is said and done, this film grabbed my attention because it is different. I like it because by making the comedy so understated it twists the plot into a neat mystery within some classic lines. If your not entertained here by the holes in the donut, then your missing the point. Rian Johnson is laughing at you as a viewer if you do not get what he has done here. Considering a Benoit Blanc sequel is on the way, he is laughing all the way to the bank. I am laughing with him, because I am wondering how the sequel is gonna be anywhere near as entertaining or as funny as this one is? I am looking forward to finding that one out.It's obvious who the murderer is only this one sets a trap that a few viewers got out of. They didn't seem to get the jokes. Maybe the sequel should just use the same cast and locales and rewrite the will? No, that would really be confusing though Benoit Blanc could then bring in the knives?"
353,"The way this movie started, I thought this would be a masterpiece. Great acting by Daniel Craig. However the movie ended up being with a predictable ending."
354,"Typical hollywood. Very predictable, would have stopped watching if not for Daniel Craig."
355,"Kind of boring, it was just okay I don't understand all the hype."
356,"It's a fun enough movie to sit through for some casual entertainment, but don't go into the movie expecting a clever crime / mystery story. The ""culprit"" is revealed way too early, making me expect there was more to it, which it hardly was. The rest of the ""reveal"", isn't much and is obvious at the point it's being revealed. If you have ever read a good crime mystery novel, it will leave you disappointed.The acting overall is fine. But Daniel Craig's southern accent is terrible, he should have stuck to speaking British accent. It wouldn't have hurt the plot or movie. But I guess Ryan was subverting our expectations on that one.There are a bit too much underline throughout the movie as well. Not gonna spoil anything, but it's jarring scenes that only a woke person could ever believe would be a realistic line of dialogue or portray of character. Immigrant worker good! Rich people bad!"
357,The story is nice but it's stupid and not realistic. I didn't get the whole hype about the movie. Its just exaggerated.
358,"I honestly can't understand the many positive reviews of this movie. A great cast does definitely not make a great movie, and this movie certainly proves that. The ridiculous and badly done accent from Daniel Craig draws all attention away from the story, and it's uncanny how any director can fumble up a movie with a cast like this... But apparently if anyone can, Ryan Johnson is your man. After ruining The Last Jedi, he keeps on going strong...."
359,After all the hype i was looking forward to be surprised but this is just another whodunit movie in Christies spirit. If you like the genre its worth a look but dont expect anything special because you have probably already seen a lot of the same through the years.
360,"Seems there's a lot of hype about this movie on IMDb, but the overwhelmingly positive reviews don't reflect reality at all, so I'm adding my own here. I guess some heavy shilling happening here.I expected a nice, captivating murder-mystery going by the synopsis, and I've seen my fair share of them -- and the cast looked good too. Was it? Not at all.The overall best one-term description I can give this movie is ""dull"".While I understand the angle of trying to reconstruct things through interviews, it was presented plainly, dry and with no real attention to flow -- in fact, it felt very fragmented, often switching between characters without hints only causing confusion and preventing any sort of story flow, coherence or character development. Whomever edited this should be fired.
Daniel Craig's performance was also underwhelming to say the least.With the movie and story overall scoring in the ""mediocre"" range, pulled further down by these points, I end up on a solid 4 out of 10 -- hardly worth more for anyone being honest in their reviews, IMHO."
361,"Rian Johnson has jumped genres throughout his career - the noir Brick, the comedy of The Brothers Bloom, the science fiction of Looper, the big blockbuster that was Star Wars: the Last Jedi and now Knives Out. He also helmed an episode of Breaking Bad that won him a directing Emmy.Since 2005, Johnson has had this Agatha Christie-influenced film in mind. He also cited films like Deathtrap and Clue as cultural touchstones for this movie.So what's it all about? Well, crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead - a suicide - at his estate the day after his 85th birthday. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired by an unnamed party to investigate the crime. From Harlan's dysfunctional family to his devoted staff, Blanc sifts through a web of red herrings and self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's untimely death.First things first: my attention span has been ruined by a steady diet of grindhouse movies, Hong Kong cinema and the works of Italian gorehounds. A movie over two hours long is quite intimidating to me, but I did my best to stick with it.So the good things: Daniel Craig is absolutely having the time of his life playing private detective Benoit Blanc and every scene with him is a joy to watch. I really enjoyed the twists and turns of the plot, as well as the detection flashbacks, which brought to mind the original Murder on the Orient Express. And it's always great to see Plummer in a movie, as he was, after all the emperor of the galaxy in Starcrash. Yes, that's my cultural callback for this venerated actor.This movie is a chance for Chris Evans to break out of the superhero mold he's found himself in. And Ana de Armas - who is also in the Eli Roth film Knock Knock - is great as Marta Cabrera, the nurse who finds herself inheriting the estate of the murdered writer who is the patriarch of this family of liars and thieves at the heart of this story.Hey - there's M. Emmet Walsh, filling in for Ricky Jay who died during production. And Riki Lindhome from Garfunkle and Oates and the remake of The Last House on the Left (and also Under the Silver Lake). Plus, it's cool to see Frank Oz in his first onscreen role since, well, Blues Brothers 2000.But man - there are so many characters here that have little or no time to shine. Jamie Lee Curtis is basically playing a cameo role and you could say the same thing for Toni Colette, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson.When we reached the one hour point, my wife asked me, ""How much longer does this have?"" I told her that we weren't even halfway done yet and she replied, ""What else do they have to tell us?""I liked the film more than her. Despite reading reviews filled with hyperbole saying things about how this movie has reinvented the murder mystery and turned it on its head, I thought it was a pleasant enough diversion. It's not going to replace Agatha Christie movies for me, but for an audience that has probably never seen the films like Sleuth and Gosford Park that Johnson is inspired by, it's certainly a revelation for them.Your mileage, as I always say, may vary."
362,"I like a good murder mystery and Hollywood hasn't been making them since the 90's so I was looking forward to this based on the glowing reviews and the 8.1 rating on imdb. Unfortunately as murder mysteries go this one doesn't really have anything original to add. It's also quite boring. It started very slowly with loads of scenes of people sitting in rooms talking in long boring monologues. I love a good dialogue driven movie like The Social Network, Reservoir Dogs, A Few Good Men, Moneyball, The Lincoln Lawyer etc, but the dialogue in Knives Out is bland and full of pretentious waffle.
It finally got interesting in the last half hour, but the way the crime was solved was lazy. Daniel Craig calls the guilty party into a room and then explains exactly how the crime was committed despite the fact he hasn't really done much in the way of investigating. It's just lazy. It's meant to be clever, but I was expecting a further twist because I couldn't believe it would be this basic, but it is. Basically Daniel Craig chats to everyone for an hour or so then in classic Columbo style reveals he has all the answers and you're supposed to be blown away by how clever it all is. I wasn't. I'm giving it a 5/10 because at least it was something different coming out of Hollywood for a change. I'm fed up with reboots, superhero movies and big franchises so I'm happy that this was made. I just wish it was better."
363,"Ok, it was a nice enough film, poor in the first half but got better. But seriously - an 8.2 rating (immediately before I went on 14/12/19) - someone has been rigging the system."
364,"I thought this movie was going to be a mystery, the only mystery was solved in the middle of the movie and your easily able to narrow it down between two people. It wasn't that surprising of a reveal and the other characters stories were almost irrelevant. I wanted to be confused and surprised. But they focused too much on one character. It wasn't a terrible movie I just regret paying to see it."
365,"Apart from the great production design and Christopher Plummer the only other reason to watch this movie is to listen to Daniel Craig's accent. The cinematographer clearly is not a fan of making his cast look like film stars. I've never seen so many crows feet, wrinkles and dark sunken eyes."
366,"A norther political driving movie from Star Wars Killer Rian Johnson. A 2 hour and change movie that I spended more time looking at my watch than the actual movie. Tries to be smarter than the audience, but for me it was just stupid, dumb and no actual reason for people to pay money to watch this. I thank God I didn't pay to see this movie. So if you are an SJW this is for you, but if you are not skip this movie and don't waste your time."
367,Blows my mind this movie has an 8. Drags on and on and on.
368,I've yet to like anything this guy has made. Maybe he just needs to quit. I've had more fun watching paint dry.
369,You already saw looper star wars this is another anti parent moive
370,"I really was not expecting a ""spoof"" of a movie. Especially with Daniel Craig in the movie. Slap happy is good sometimes but with all these fantastic actors I was shocked and so bored with this movie."
371,"Once again, Rian Johnson proves himself to be a great director (particularly with visuals) but an absolutely awful writer who's obsession with exploring social/political themes always comes at the cost of turning almost every plot point and character ark into MacGuffins. For the record, I actually agree with his politics so please don't me. But good stories make for intelligent social commentary, not the other way around.The cast are brilliant though so that's something!"
372,"Believe me you don't want to waste your time on this. Even though I love Ana de Armas, this movie is so bad I had to leave early. All key characters are incredibly dumb which you can't have in a detective movie. Somehow this movie just doesn't claim to be realistic."
373,"Not quite as entertaining as expected. Maybe my expectations are too high. I really didn't find any of the characters to be too believable, in spite of the high caliber of the cast. Just a bunch of stereotypical spoiled trust fund babies with no redeeming characteristics. Anyone of them could have been the murderer and it really wouldn't have mattered. Just flip a coin and work in some back-story at the end and it still would have been the same story. To me it was more like a Who cares whodunit"" than a traditional whodunit."
374,"I love a good slow-burn film. This film was just slow. I think the folks who loved the train wreck Star Wars film Johnson directed went out of their way to praise this film. If you prefer politics, political correctness, and putting your worldview over actual good storytelling, then Ryan Johnson films are for you."
375,"So, I went into this movie expecting a ton of enjoyment and was left utterly dumbfounded. The story starts well, with an awesome ensemble cast, and a who done it vibe.
About an hour in it falls apart drastically, the script and casting of the main actress largely to blame. Ana de Armas is Awful. Why couldn't they pick an actress that can actually, well, act? Beyond me.
For all it's good intentions this was a failed opportunity. If you are.looiing for a murder mystery, look elsewhere.
Boring, pathetic nonsense."
376,"Who dunnit like a good whodunnit? (See what I did there?)Knives out looks great on paper. Ensemble cast filled with great talent, all sure to be delivering quirky, eccentric performances through a roller coster plot with a twist at the end. What could go wrong?Overall, I thought the actors delivered well, no real faults. Indeed, the performances are all the more impressive considering some of the odd casting.
Craig, who was horribly miscast, puts on an unexpectedly enjoyable performance as a sleuth from the Louisiana Bayou. de Armas puts on a very strong performance despite the horrible character device she was handicapped. Special mention for Evans who does a wonderful turn as creepy bad guy. Clearly Evans has been miscast in the past in all those hero roles.The dialog is decent enough as well. A wee bit Hollywood at times but not achingly so. And a fair amount of good jabs as the quirky characters cut into each other.And I'll tip my hat for good cinematography. The film did look wonderful.So what went wrong? In a word, the plot. Points for novelty, but the circumstance is just too improbable to accept Plummer's reactions. But that really isn't the worst of the film. The biggest problem is that the plot places far too much of the story on de Armas' character. So much so that all the other characters fall away and become largely irrelevant. And when one particular character stands up to assist de Armas, well, you know then and there whodunnit. That whole ensemble cast, who each should have been vying for a place as the bad guy right up until the very end, instead relegated to a bit of shouting and noise from the sideline. It's the pre-school toddler's, 9 piece puzzle version of a whodunnit.There you go, a fair and honest review without mentioning Rian or Star Wars........"
377,"Knives out is a somewhat tedious, somewhat hammy whodunit.Despite the director's imfamy for mediocrity, and the telltale sign of disapointment that is a star-studded cast I still decided to see the film. Got what I deserved - a slightly achey backside and that awful feeling of having been ripped off.Too many of the cast appear miscast. Daniel Craig especially. The accent he was using did not work and breaks immersion every time it is audible.4 and a half stars."
378,"While I recognise that people have different tastes and all that you would be best advised to ignore all the 1/10 reviews on here. Please leave baggage, politics (this film is not political - it's a social satire) and Star Wars at the door to the auditorium.
Brilliantly acted by an A list cast, a humerous direction, a film that captures every little nuance. And a plot that develops wonderfully.And remember that it's no good to fill a donut with a donut..."
379,"Awards season is the only time of year I feel like theaters are full of movies for adults, when films focus on mature and serious subject matter. But I like to laugh and have fun at a movie too, and man did I do both at ""Knives Out."" Rian Johnson embraces the murder mystery genre wholesale and delivers a twisty-turner thriller that's both wildly entertaining and very funny. A superlative cast, witty screenplay, and brilliantly quirky production design are three of this movie's standout qualities. Daniel Craig, complete with Southern Gothic accent, and Ana de Armas are the leads, but they're surrounded by a cast of supporting actors performing at the top of their game. Indeed, if I have any criticism of the film, it's actually a compliment, and that's that I wish the supporting players -- like Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield, and Don Johnson (of all people) -- were in the film more.""Knives Out"" is mostly just a good time, but it's also got some serious barbs to throw out at its presumably mostly liberal audience about a certain kind of liberal progressive hypocrisy that rears its ugly head when issues like immigration and economic equality take center stage.Grade: A"
380,"Saw this movie based on the generally good reviews and because I am a fan of Mystery/Detective movies. Unfortunately, it is just another liberal propaganda movie - illegal aliens good, white people bad. The acting is average, the ""mystery"" non-existent and the script is predictable. There are no laughs even though it is billed as being partly a comedy. I can only assume the good reviews are from people either trying to curry favor from Hollywood or people who agree with the liberal message."
381,"Guarantee the majority of people who rated this film 1 Star and scroll through the reviews marking them as uninteresting are simply children who didn't like The Last Jedi. News flash, that was a great film and so is this one. It's tense, funny, witty, and interesting from start to finish."
382,So many rave reviews. Why? I found it far too long. Deadly BORING. Plot contrived and infantile. I dozed off a few times and was completely unmoved. No laughs. Was it supposed to be a comedy? I think my score of 2 is generous.
383,"I will say the performances and cinematography was great, but this film honestly just annoyed me.Before they get a chance to finish the motives they show the biggest details on Harlan's death and Marta running away from it.They end up having Marta taking the entire will from this family as the right ending and just thing to happen.. are you serious Rian?I get this family has some dirtbags in it but Harlan is showing that he is the biggest dirt bag of all. There are 4 members in the family who get cut off for bad actions and only two of them truly did a bad action to deserve being removed from the will. Richard cheating and Joni stealing.Richard cheats on his wife Linda so Harlan wants to expose him, fair enough. But why make Linda suffer more? He should expose Richard and let her handle it, but remove her from his will? Come onJoni steals 100k a year which is also fair to cut her off for, but that means Harlan will no longer pay for his granddaughters education? Is he really that big of an asshat?Other two ""vultures"" in the family didn't do anything. Ransom does nearly nothing before he gets cut off. Walt is only trying to do his job by growing the business and he gets fired for trying to convince his father what he thinks is best? And on top of that is out of the will? I mean Harlan is the worst!Yet we are supposed to be happy that this plan of his to screw over these people In his family (let's not forget the other number of innocent family members) and hand off his money to a young girl he likes is a good thing. It's a joke and clearly has anti-rich undertones in the storytelling.The entire film has flawed logic for what is right and wrong."
384,"I agree with a lot of people that the first part of the movie was good, but it falls kinda flat after that. The acting is good for the most part but the plot twists are mostly predictable and not that clever. The humor is ok.
I am also not a fan of the the left liberal politics thrown in to the movie where white people are bad and greedy and immigrants legal or illegal are good. Sorry the politics were forced and unnecessary.
Overall its entertaining but nothing great or memorable. It doesn't deserve anything higher than a 6 or 7."
385,"This movie isn't good. I know the director has his fans and that's cool but this is definitely worth skipping. The all star cast is wasted by hardly having any screen time. The plot, despite being billed as clever, is derivative and easily figured out. The acting is mediocre. It seems the director peaked with Brick and continues his downward creative freefall. I had very high hopes for this, lower your expectations."
386,"Heavy spoilers ahead.This movie paints the nurse as a poor innocent victim, despite the fact that she's heavily negligent (no, you are not a good nurse if you ""know"" the drug by its viscosity. If you're a good nurse, then you check and you double check.) lies to the police, tampers with evidence and obstructs justice. I enjoy a good anti hero or anti villain, but when a character is hailed as a good person, despite all of this.... The movie seems more concerned with jumping on the bandwagon of todays political climate than tell a good story. I'm angry I wasted two hours of my life on this."
387,"Why the hype? I have no idea. Fortunately I had one advantage over the audience at the theaters: fast forward. It was so painfully slow throughout, by the middle of the movie, I was thinking this is either gonna end like the usual suspect or dumb and dumber. It became clear after the lawyer read the will. I mean, think about it, even before the sweet and caring Marta can gain control of the assets, she has to clear a lot of hurdles. The family members can file for a court injunction, sue her for wrongful death, undue influence and theft. If she's really lucky, she wins every legal battle and gets to run a small company, but does she understand corporate accounting and intellectual property laws? If she's less lucky, she gets to settle all the lawsuits by selling or giving away all the assets to the circling sharks. If she's out of luck, she'll be incarcerated and tried for murder. The old Thrombey had basically put Marta in a living hell. If I were her, I'd give up all the assets in exchange for not pressing charges and move to Uruguay and live a normal life."
388,"Very, very boring. Go see Midway. Go see Midway !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
389,"The whodunit seemed to be a dead genre, confined to the 60's and 70's, but with Knives out, and Death on the Nile set for November, maybe there is still some interest left.This is a seriously stylish, well crafted and all around awesome movie, huge credit to the writer for coming up with a plot that was relevant for present day, and which was quite brilliant. Plenty of twists, turns and red herrings, it's a smashing mix of drama and humour.Terrific acting from the ensemble cast, Daniel Craig, Toni Colette, Jamie Lee Curtis all wonderful, Chris Evans was awesome.It has been a success, it'll be interesting to see if it does reawaken the whodunit genre.9/10"
390,"I don't mean to be unkind,..... however this movie missed the mark for me. I've been watching whodunits from Charlie Chan to the Thin Man to etc etc. This movie in my opinion was just awful, just awful it was slow, the story was slow you kept hoping that something is going to happen and finally at the very, very end..... it did. but it took forever to get there. I'm sorry I do not recommend this movie wait until it comes out a year from now and rent it for 2.99 do not rent it for fifteen bucks it's not worth it.
This movie made the actors a great deal but I think the movie goers were left flat. I'll sum it up in one word.... boring"
391,"I don't get all the love for this movie. I mean it certainly starts off well enough, introducing a big cast of great actors playing what look to be some pretty interesting characters, but unfortunately all these potential-filled characters fade into the background pretty quickly and the majority of the film is just the adventures of Ana De Armas and Chris Evans in what has to be one of the worst murder mysteries I've ever seen.That's huge mistake #1: Pushing the majority of the cast to the side, which not only deprives the audience of all those interesting characters, but also has the side effect of making it very obvious that all these sidelined characters are in fact not suspects at all.Huge mistake #2: The movie then shows us explicitly exactly how Christopher Plummer's character died. The mystery is ruined before it even really starts because we know already know almost everything there is to know very early on except for which member of the family somehow caused this incident, but then...Huge mistake #3: After De Armas is revealed to be the scapegoat protagonist, all of the suspects are quickly pushed aside like I said before...all except Chris Evans, the black sheep of the family who out of nowhere decides he's going to be nice and help her prove her innocence! GEE! I WONDER WHY HE WOULD DO THAT? WHO COULD THE KILLER BE I WONDER? Since these two are now almost the sole focus of the rest of the movie they are now the only two possibilities SO GEE WHICH ONE OF THEM COULD IT BE? HMMMHuge mistake #4: The finale. After we learn that the ""killer"" is in fact the one painfully obvious suspect we're treated to a ridiculously contrived explanation for how the things we already know happened happened. It's so unnecessarily convoluted and changes almost nothing about what we already know happened to the victim. It's just a small, pointless piece of emotional manipulation to make us feel extra sympathy for someone who was already the sympathetic wrongly-accused-of-murder protagonist. It just feels like an empty non-twist.I give Johnson a little credit for the stylish setup and interesting cast of characters, both of which had a lot of potential, but not credit much since it's all completely wasted on a generic, predictable, bargain bin mystery with no real substance. This is a 5 or 6 out of 10 at best."

393,Such a fun film. This is an old school who-dun-it with great acting and excellent plot twists. So refreshing to see a movie done in this day and age. What fun!
394,This is a fantastic movie.. Great acting from everyone in this and a wonderfully written story.. Thanks to everyone involved.. great job
395,"Hidden in the image of paying homage to the traditional British reasoning novels and movies, it is actually a wanton rebellion against this classic type. Such absurd settings and nearly naked political implications as a number of unreliable narrators plus an absolutely reliable narrator are rarely seen in hard core reasoning works."
396,"This is the best murder mystery movie. The movie is funny, suspenseful and the ending is just what everyone wanted. By the way Daniel Craig is amazing."
397,"Just what the doctored order in these troubled times: engaging, surprising with lots of twists, well crafted and acted..definitely worth watching but don't expect a message. This is pure entertainment."
398,"I figured out the murderer very early on it didn't actually make you even think very much. I'm a hardcore crime and mystery fan, but I've seen better TV series mysteries than this."
399,One of the great movies. Good for all family. There is no disgraceful scene.
400,"""Physical evidence can tell a story with a forked tongue, and as we've seen from this morning, everyone can lie.""
~ Detective Benoit BlancThis beautifully shot Agatha Christie-type whodunit film pipped with clever details and surprises alongside some transparent plot twists.Daniel Craig is charming and fun as Detective Benoit Blanc who is hired by an anonymous source to investigate a possible crime. The maybe-murder-maybe-suicide takes place in the home of a wealthy family filled with tragically flawed, deliciously unlikeable people played enthusiastically by a talented ensemble.Ana De Amas is the likable protagonist with a convenient character flaw that if taken too seriously will be annoying; I accepted the habit in context of the farce, so I enjoyed the movie.For all it's foibles, Knives Out is a great watch.*Warning - there is a moment when a character slits his throat, which was horrible for me to see.*"
401,"With a cast like this, you'd expect great things for a film billed as a great murder mystery.
The entire plot is revealed in the first 5 minutes, and the end ""twist"" was hardly a twist. You could see it coming a mile away.
Save your time and watch a real murder mystery from classic authors."
402,I was really waiting to watch this movie after watching the trailer. This reminded me of the famous Agatha Christie's Poirot. Everyone acted well. The script was bounding.
403,"It wasn't mysterious enough to be a mystery, wasn't funny enough to be a comedy(everything funny was in the trailer), wasn't dramatic enough to be drama.There is not enough of anything to explain the hype over the film outside of the casting of Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson. The acting was on par but everything else was pale in comparison. By the end I did not care who, what, when or why...just wanted it to be over."
404,"Excellent who done it? But.......Loaded with Hollywood politics takes away from a very descent movie. People go to the movies to escape, not be indoctrinated. Good try though."
405,"I mostly enjoyed this movie, it was fun, with it's over the top characters and a lush mystery house mansion. Toward the end of the movie it began to dawn on me: all the white people in this flick are bad, irredeemably bad, bad to the bone. They even looked bad. So much for complexity of characters (which is usually the backbone of a good mystery!) The only family member that seems slightly redeemable is the owner of all this wealth, because, in his old age he's come upon the wisdom that the only way to fix his evil evil family is to cut them all off with out a red cent.My take away: at the end of the movie I turned to my husband and said, ""white man bad"". Nuff said"
406,"Does anyone really believe that it is a coincidence that the new film Knives Out by Rian Johnson, who failed so colossally as a director of Star Wars The Last Jedi and has probably delivered the worst film of all time, comes to the cinemas a few days before the world premiere of Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker ???
The only reason this man could get all these famous actors for Knives Out is because Disney needed a good film by Rian Johnson after his disastrous The Last Jedi in order to rehabilitate him as a director and justify further Star Wars movies. Everybody knows that Star Wars The Last Jedi is so incredibly bad that it destroyed the whole Star Wars Universe."
407,"Refreshing Murder Mystery
Beautiful shots
Amazing combination of star casts"
408,"Just another left wing open borders political statement under the guise of 'entertainment'. Message: white Americans, bad; Honduran maids who are brilliant 'Go masters' good. In Hollywood's dreams."
409,I usually watch slow movies but this one is boring as hell. don't waste ur time
410,Lots of famous actors going through the motions of an extremely predictable and pedestrian story. Wow. Disappointing.
411,"Wow what a complicated plot for what really amounts to ""white people are the devil and brown people are literal angels sent from heaven."""
412,"Rian is not good script writer. He thinks how smart he is, but he is not. He is just conceited and stupid. This movie is the proof. To show the murderer 20 minutes from the beginnig of the movie is just plain stupid. After that you have no motivation to watch another hour and half, because there is nothing more to watch. There is no mystery, no connection to the actors, nothing.Every episode of Columbo or Moon Lighting is better."
413,So predictable.. don't waste your time .. it's not nothing special .
414,"Had all the makings of a great film, but an incredible cast and their stellar performances couldn't lift this film out of ""dumpster fire"" territory. What a shame the storytellers couldn't keep their latest weird Californian politics out of it. The sooner Trump gets voted out, the better, then Hollywood can return to good movies.Decent cinematography and a great performance by Daniel Craig especially might make it tolerable."
415,This is one murder mystery movie in which I knew the murderer in his first scene itself
416,"Great cast. But as expected,.. nothing original. Don't waste your money and time.
If you're into murder mystery genre... then go watch Murder on Orient express.
Way more fun."
417,"85 year old Harlan Thrombey, a hugely successful novelist, has brought the family together in order to deliver bad news about his will. He is found the next morning with his throat cut and it appears to be suicide. But with so much motive around, who knows. There is also the mystery of who hired private investigator Benoit Blanc and why. And is Harlan's weet carer Marta all she seems? Might she not have a secret?This darkly funny who-dun-what is brilliantly cast and acted. But the writing and direction is stellar, too, so the fantastic cast just puts the cream on top. The plot appears simple, but is very well conceived - you think you should know what's going on, but you never quite do.And I must give all credit to Rian Johnson, a man I was perfectly willing to hate for the rest of my life for the way he wilfully scorned his audience in Star Wars: The Last Jedi. But his writing and direction here have redeemed him in my eyes. If there is a flaw in this film, it is Daniel Craig's excessively fruity southern accent. In all other respects this film is nearly perfect."
418,"This film start with an old man ""Harlan"" die in his room, and all the family member of Harlan been summon to interrogate by a detective ""Benoit"" scene! As turnout, this film is about Ransom after knowing Harlan giving all his inheritance to a nurse ""Marta"", he mess up the medicine of Marta use to cure Harlan, Marta think she giving Harlan wrong dose, and eventually Harlan kill himself to help Marta cover up his wrong doing! Entire film quite slow, and full of boring conversation! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, a bunch of cops chasing the car drive by Marta and Ransom! Barely laughable scene is, Marta vomit at Ransom! At the end, Ransom kill Fran! After deceive by Marta, Fran still alive! Ransom try to stab Marta with a fake knife! Ransom eventually get caught! All the remaining family member of Harlan stare at Marta! That's it! Talking two hours more to find a real murderer! Zero action and zero intensity! Wasting time to watch!"
419,This was a great movie. They need to make more like this! It was like clue. I love a good who done it murder mystery movie.
420,"It's very rare that a newer movie will keep my attention and glued to it for the entire duration, but this one impressed me! Full of twists, turns, plot twists and red herrings that really keep you guessing. It's like a reinvented old classic who-done-it but in a modern time frame, think back to a classic Alfred Hitchcock flick or a movie adapted Agatha Christie novel. The only thing that might've (and I say might've because this movie was just so good otherwise) been cool is if it were set back to an older time rather than a modern one but still, very very cool movie and very well done! More than likely going to be buying this one."
421,"Let's address the elephant in the room. The family threatening to deport someone if they don't give up a multi-million dollar inheritance make no sense. Why would you give up millions to stay in America, when you could go back to your home country with your million dollar inheritance and live like Bill Gates."
422,"White rich people are evil and the poor illegal immigrant anchor baby is the victim/hero. Whatever.
Such a great cast to be wasted on such horrible writing."
423,The story was perfect with happy ending even the director of the movie is smart
424,"I had some high expectations before watching it, but found it utterly disappointing. As a detective story, it is both predictable, buggy, and weak; as a feature film, it doesn't have much real content.So does the movie wanted to promote or warn:1. Americans are good-for-nothing greedy kids;2. Immigrants are kind and innocent;3. Immigrants should/deserve to take over ""America""?"
425,"Wonderfully written, directed and well played. No a dull moment."
426,"Holy moly..what i have just seen!
This movie keeps you at the edge till the end credits.
I am so lucky to watched it on first day first show.
The story is fantastic, the tensions in the scenes are fabulous, the acting, the direction blah blah...everything is to the mark. Like every detective movie we get to feel that the suspect is this, that etc but the twist makes us flattered.
The plot is simple but kept hidden very cleverly till the end.
We love Daniel Craig here. Every time he comes to the house there's a spark in the scenes. His accent is very nice to hear as detective blanc. I really felt satisfied at the end and the ending song is a perfect choice. I loved this movie and urge you to go and dont waste any freaking time watching any other movie of this genre.
Must see movie for movie lovers."
427,Great movie that is based on murder mystery game. The acting is great and the story is well-paced.
428,"The one liners and over-the-top performances make this a fun who-dunnit, even though the movie gives away its ending at the halfway point. Because you think you know everything there is to know by the end of the 2nd act, the beginning of the 3rd act seems confusing and disconnected... that is until the final reveal hits you and you realize that the writer has far more tricks up his sleeve than you were ready for.The final reveal is done with an old fashioned great big soliloquy by Daniel Craig's character (who is a PI with a cartoonish Southern accent.) I, personally loved it."
429,"Sorry about the headline -- just got a little excited,
because you don't see these types of movies all the time, and if you do, they're usually cheaply made, or are not movies and are TV shows.The whole cast was great. Edi Patterson is getting more famous even though she has a small (but significant) part, and Daniel Craig actually does a good job acting with a southern accent. D. Johnson and M. Shannon also did their great usual acting jobs -- both very solid.The plot you'll never see coming -- I didn't. Just watch it. Everyone won't like it, but if you like mystery movies, you will."
430,"BEWARE. Boredom warning: this movie came from the same director who made ""Looper"". Fascinating and SEEMINGLY intricate at the start, but after half an hour this director was ONLY capable of PRETENDING to be interesting, because anybody who knows LOOPER knows it's masterfully photographed and acted, but COMPLETELY lacking in coherency, lacking in ANY kind of grit, gut, spark or punch. Basically all the movies this director makes are somehow MESSED UP.The story: Agatha Christie detective story. Intelligent, well acted, but TOO complicated who dunnit story about a murder.The good: the acting is great. Really. It's a bit too much, a bit OVER acted, but that is done for the comedy effect. But the actors and the acting is enjoyable.The bad: the story is a mess. It just does not mold together. It's going everywhere and nowhere simultaneously. It's simply put, TOO MANY PLOT LINES glued together, just for the sake of it. Wannabe smart writing. Wannabe smart direction. Disappointing..."
431,"Forget ingenious twists- this is more about the comedy. An eccentric crime writer (Christopher Plummer) appears to have killed himself but is there something untoward? Anyone of his equally eccentric self-centred family could have done it.The details to watch out for, the important lines to remember for later are well signalled so it's more the comedy and anticipation for the pay off.Daniel Craig as detective Benoit Blanc (basically Poirot's Southern cousin) is having a lot of fun in the role- nice to see the comedy that has been missing from his Bond films since Casino Royale. Maybe it'll open up some lighter comedy after he finishes his stint as Bond."
432,"1. It is entertaining I liked it.
2. Its not like Clue where everyone is a suspect and your guessing who the real culprit is.
3. The plot and motives are very unclear for the central characters in the movie. Some people are ""bad"" for no good reason...some are ""good"" for no good reason....
4. typical stuff, as a ""minority"" its so annoying and exhausting that our only identity is related to your guilt..."
433,"A movie of two halves - the first is so slow & boring - the second speeds up & becomes more interesting but rather ridiculous.
The worst thing about it is Daniel Craig's appalling accent that comes and goes. It really needs an American in this role (and I'm a Brit who's lived in Atlanta) - he seems totally mis-cast to me. I really can't imagine how he's up for a Golden Globe?!
I think I expected more from such a strong cast."
434,"Knives out Is an enjoyable reworking of the classic whodunit format which can be found In Mystery's such as Agatha Christie.Directed by Rian Johnson after a wealthy novelist ,named Harlan Thormbey Is found murdered In his Study his family gather at the House to be questioned by Police Individually, until a mysterious Columbo esque Detective named Blanc played by Daniel Craig wanders onto the Scene and the mystery begins to unfold.I enjoyed this film because of how self aware It was giving subtle nods to cliches found In Murder Mysterys as well as the Performances the standouts In my opinion Include Daniel Craig whose accent I thought was Just fine and Chris Evans as the disgruntled son Ransome.
The other actors complimented each other so well you'd think they were a real family.My only gripes Include the Script which I felt could've been written a bit tighter, and the climax which I think was gross and lacking In Imagination and the Inclusion of Modern Technology which I felt was an gimmick that was not needed.Overall Knives out Is a pleasant murder mystery with some funny throw away lines and In-Jokes from other Storys,
If your a fan of Murder Mystery's and want to see the format from another perspective give It a try."
435,"This movie was close to a future classic, but there are a few areas that it fell flat in. First the good: it was very well acted(of course!) it was beautifully shot, it was Funny!, the mix between humor and action was balanced
The bad: the mystery side of it was shallow and very easily foreseeable, they could have built up a better sense of suspense and made it a real ""who done it"", the humor was absurd and over the top sometimes(depending on your point of view could be good or bad), the political message was weird and heavy handed in the end, it managed to avoid being too political until the finale. When it is broken down as moral message it didn't really make much sense at all. If it was a better mystery I would have given it an 8, if it got away from political blah blah it'd probably have been a 9."
436,"Can't say much about the plot without giving away spoilers, but I can say everyone should go right out and see this when it hits theaters. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun watching a film and enjoying the audiences combined reactions to it. There were so many laughs and gasps and then outright cheers and clapping when the movie was over. It was THAT good! The whole cast was amazing! I mean, why wouldn't they be, considering what an incredible list of actors there are in this? But really, they all were on top game with their acting. You know you're going to get great performances when you can see that the actors are genuinely having the time of their life playing their characters. They were just chewing it up and the banter between them was so entertaining to watch. Rian Johnson is an amazing writer and director, there is no doubt about it. I did not want to see the movie end because I was just having a blast and then when it did, I immediately wanted to see it again. For hours after seeing it, I just kept playing parts over in my head and thinking ""My God! That was brilliant!"" With the theaters recently over-dominated with superhero movies, it's so refreshing to see a classic who-dun-it movie, and one done so perfectly well. I can not say this enough; you MUST see this when it comes out in theaters or you'll be missing on a great gem of a movie. This is brilliant film-making if I ever saw it!"
437,"If I had a chunk, a piece, the tiniest little fragment of Rian Johnson's mind, I'm still not sure I'd know what to do with it. Forgive me for the number of superlatives in this one.Knives Out is astonishing. An immensely entertaining, thrillingly escapist whodunnit that pulls the rug out from underneath you more times than you can count. Every line has a payoff, every hint has a resolution. It's razor sharp and uproariously funny, with Johnson giving every cast member enough juice to play with but plenty of room to still have their own unique kinds of fun. It's a writers' movie through and through, but the cast still shine.Saying any more and properly diving into what Johnson is really doing here risks spoiling elements the film, and Knives Out is not a story you want spoiled. Johnson reliably plays with formula, he riffs on Vertigo and adds layer upon layer, having a blast as he does so - and it's infectious. Sharp, fast, funny and beautifully satisfying down to its body-tinglingly cathartic final frame. Knives Out is a fiendishly and relentlessly clever film, but Johnson does what he always does - he makes it look easy.My favourite film of the year."
438,A canny movie written with the intent of calling conservatives Nazi's.
439,I couldn't watch more than 45 minutes of this movie. What was the point? I couldn't stand the fact that nothing happened. I'm not interested in watching a movie where non-funny actors talk about nothing.
440,"Basically, the guilty party is exactly the person entire cast thinks is the guilty party throughout entire movie. it's weird that director has whole this thing where he goes on and on about how much he loves plot twists and why they are important, yet he fails to deliver one. I mean they are literally all pointing finger at the guilty party entire film, and you sit there waiting for it to turn out to be someone else, but no, it is who they told you it is from the get go. the only mystery that remains is ""how"" and answer to that is ""in a very convoluted way that character is definitely to dumb to think of"". yup.there's nothing to save this film, where it tries to be charming, it fails cause it's too hollywood, and charm of this genre is british kinda thing. where it tries to be funny it fails, nothing more to say about that. where it tries to be clever, it fails cause it's either too in your face, or too convoluted to seem realistic. it's just load of nonsense that you can't even care for. and the characters are bland and boring. the characters they want you to feel most for, are so obnoxious you want them to be guilty, and there are side characters that fall together with the rest, for no reason, like some of them did nothing wrong, at any point, definitely didn't deserve what has befallen them, yet they all end up in same stew.it just makes no sense"
441,"I thought about going to the cinema to watch this movie... The plot was so interesting, the cast seemed good and couldn't stop feeling a bit of a cliché pre-viewing. I have to admit that I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie! Always trying to guess who did what and trying to connect all the dots. It's a superb suspense and intriguing movie but I also laughed so many times, a lot more than I was expecting. The cast was amazing but congratulations to Daniel Craig, really enjoyed his character. The thing is, you can watch the movie several times and even though you already know who commited the crime, if you pay close attention you will always discover and connect something new and sooner than before. Really entertaining and overall very good movie"
442,"'Knives Out (2019)' is the kind of movie they don't make anymore, a mansion-based whodunnit with an all-star cast and a charismatically quirky lead, but that doesn't mean it's old-fashioned. In fact, it feels fresh, modern and genre-literate. It uses its cinematic awareness to craft a devilishly enjoyable fable, a fun and evolving mystery that delivers the goods on pretty much all fronts. Despite what the marketing would have you believe, Daniel ""Bored Of Bond"" Craig isn't the protagonist. This makes for a detective story in which the detective isn't the one you want to see succeed, even though he isn't an antagonist in any shape or form, and this is rather refreshing. By giving certain aspects of its story away shockingly early, the flick leans away from suspicion and head-first into suspense. Johnson still manages to add an ample amount of wrinkles to the plot as it thickens, though. It's unpredictable and engaging throughout, peppered with the sort of surprises that the genre demands. Even though it does end with the typical, detective-led exposition dump, it's an incredibly satisfying experience. This is primarily because you're always engaged by proceedings, kept on your toes as the ultimately rather unique story unravels. It's a crowd-pleasing affair, a clever twist on its well-worn premise that still conforms to certain expectations. It's also fairly well-written, dialogue-heavy but not plodding, and has a good sense of tone, playing with the absurdities of Cluedo-esque situations without reducing its overall sincerity. It's aware of what it is but it isn't annoyingly meta. The crisp cinematography compliments its almost timeless feel, while the assured direction establishes itself as stylish yet subdued. Every core player plays their role excellently, no matter how much time or attention they're actually awarded. That includes the previously mentioned Craig, whose chewy southern drawl actually isn't as distracting as it could have been. Shannon, Evans, Plummer and De Armas stand out as being particularly good, too, regardless of the size of their role. Much of the family is side-lined for the majority of the time, but their presence is still keenly felt and they sufficiently support the more important characters. It's hard to imagine a cast better than this and everyone delivers on the unspoken promise of their inclusion. In the end, this is a surprisingly intelligent and entertaining experience. It generally keeps getting better as it goes on. When everything falls into place, it's hard not to get a smile on your face. It's great. 8/10"
443,"I am a huge fan of mystery novels, but when it comes to films there isn't much to love. But this one came along. I really love the story, the cast itself is already likable, the acting is superb especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. The set is just amazing. Will definitely see this one again."
444,"The magnetic Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc is by far one of the greatest filmic creations of 2019. This film, and specifically Blanc, brilliantly walks the line between campiness and seriousness; and, in doing so, is one of the most enjoyable theater-going experiences of the year. Just one of Blanc's ridiculous, Southern, overlong monologues about the pursuit of truth will have you laughing in a confused awe.This film's screenplay is smart, as it reveals crucial information early and still surprises and excites throughout. Similarly, this film tricks you into thinking you know the right information, just to show you how you've been missing it all along. Every detail matters, as crucial information is quietly planted in the first few scenes to end in loud, surprising payoffs. Knives Out is a tautly written whodunit.This movie is beautifully clever, and I recommend it to anyone with a free afternoon."
445,There's nothing good about the movie -boring plot and terrible acting. I got a headache now .Iwish I could lie but this movie is nauseating. Am sure all the people who've given this pos 8 or 9 are just paid reviews.
446,"I was genuinely poised ready to love this film. A mystery movie with great reviews and a stellar cast? Definitely my thing. And... I liked it. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it either. I liked the cinematography, the characters and the acting a lot, even if Daniel Craig's accent got on my nerves a bit. It was really an enjoyable watch. But if I'm being honest the movie frustrated me, in that for the majority of the film it seemed to be solved in the first half hour. Of course, I knew straight away that what was being presented wasn't actually what happened, but it took a while for me to feel like everything was all heading in a direction and that's what was frustrating. As for complexity in the mystery, I had solved it a half hour before the ""big"" reveal. I also figured out the minor twists before they happened, like with the knife and the ink, because there were some pretty displaced clues and comments. Which in great mysteries, these clues would have been hidden well enough that you miss them the first time so that the twists and reveals are shocking, and the clues become apparent as you understand what happened or when you see the film a second time. But they were pretty obvious straight away in this film, that I predicted everything before they happened. So although this was a good mystery, it did not reach great. I like what they were trying to do, but they definitely thought it was cleverer than it actually was. Hence, sorry Rian Johnson, but you are no Agatha Christie."
447,Rich people are evil. Poor immigrants are the salt of the earth. It's an old tale. I thought the mystery would be a lot better given the reviews but it was average and Daniel Craig's accent was really annoying. You stop caring half way through.
448,"Daniel Craig's Accent makes the film ""comedic"" in all the wrong ways.
Daniel Craig's Accent makes the film ""comedic"" in all the wrong ways.
His accent is as bad as, no even worse than Kevin Costner's in JFK. I think the only reason can be that Daniel Craig's was the money behind the film and he wanted the part, I can see no reason that a sane person would have given the role to play a southern American to him. His acting and accent is embarrassing. Why not let him play a character with an British accent or get a an actor who can talk the accent required. Shame, Daniel Craig's performance ruins a decent film. Hence 2/10 from me."
449,"This movie features an amazing, well placed plot with a great style. I love all of the twists and turns it takes. I didn't expect any of the twists on my first watch, but on my second watch, I saw the foreshadowing, Wich is exactly how I like my twists. It has great comedy that didn't distract from the mystery or the drama without creating any bad tonal shifts. That's impressive. It also handled an ensemble cast incredibly well. The cinematography and soundtrack were both incredibly fitting and good. Every scene was absolutely perfect. This movie is an amazing, well done masterpiece."
450,"I went with four friends and all four of us this felt it was meandering and pointless. They revealed everything far too early so nothing was surprising, and even the reveal was meh. Lastly, Daniel Craig's accent was like a parody of a southern accent. It grated so. I'd say wait till it comes out on Netflix."
451,"Knives Out was a delightful experience from beginning to end. At first I assumed it would stick to the general conventions of the whodunnit, as the movie started with Agatha Christie style suspect interviews. But from there it diverted slowly into its own modern twists. As the stakes got higher and events kept getting stranger, I became both excited and apprehensive for the story's direction. Could the ending really tie up all these loose threads? How will Marta or Blanc resolve any of this?Several times I thought I had the answer. And then I realized I hadn't. This movie was really good at that: keeping me in the guessing game until the very end. It had this push and pull with the pacing so that I always felt like I was just one step away from solving the mystery myself, only to get to the final reveal and get blown away. It was just so satisfying.And the performances were great too. As humorous as Knives Out was, there were also some politically charged scenes. These things can get a bit awkward depending on the performance, but I felt it was handled with great wit and care. It helped that all the characters were written very well. While the Thrombey family were all entitled rich pricks, they each had their own special shade of entitlement that I found very amusing.There is nothing bad I can say about this movie. All the beats and characters worked for me. Especially the star sleuth, Blanc. I would love to see more of his patient, observant style of detective work in the sequel."
452,"Knives Out is an aggressively underlit movie throughout, from the first scene to the last. It doesn't take long for that to become annoying. Even the outdoor scenes are dark and dreary. It drags on for 2 hours 10 minutes, laborious and slow. The director may have been trying to add portent to the long pauses, but the result is just a lot of long pauses.There are characters that are featured in many scenes without adding anything to the dialog or action. They're just there, getting face time for no discernible reason. I finally fell asleep sometime during the second hour. The people I was with told me there was one funny play on words late in the second hour, but I missed it.I can't recommend this movie, and unless you're a diehard Daniel Craig fan, which I am not, there is little to to enjoy."
453,"When I first heard about this movie, I thought, oh, ok, another murder mystery movie. It looked good and thought. Ya, I'll see it. But then my friend talked to me about it and said that it's in his top 5 films of all time, like it's ""revolutionary."" So he saw it again with me, and all I gotta say is. Wow. It was so full of hints and clues that I didn't think it was possible to for there to be anymore. This film was great, not gonna talk about it too much cause I feel like this one will be so easy to spoil and I don't want to spoil it. So just go see it."
454,Is this supposed to be a comedy? I think I might have chuckled twice. It's like Kevin Hart. You like the guy and you want to laugh; but he is not Rodney Dangerfield who had some good material.
455,"This could've been a perfectly enjoyable 1h40m popcorn flick for the Christmas season. It would have been okay at its over 2 hour length, had it been sitting at 71% on the tomatometer. However it's at 97%, and I fell asleep during the slow part in act 2. After that, it picks up and becomes a decently satisfying comedy thriller. Chris Evans character really spices things up, and Michael Shannon finally gets to do that thing he does at his best. Daniel Craig's campy foghorn leghorn performance is so over the top, that they call it out to the audience. He was at least oddly entertaining. Ana who plays the main character is dressed way down to look average, but it's impossible to hide her beauty and charm. I wish her character had more depth. She ends up mostly being stand in for the audience, rather than an active participant in the story.There was a rather pedestrian twist at the end, which wasn't really. Everything plays out as expected. There are several overt political lines and issues in this movie. It's hard to know if Rian Johnson thought he was making a grand statement about classism in the United States. The politics just felt kind of tacked on to the kooky family mystery story.See it if you have time to kill. Just don't expect to be blown away."
456,"This movie is good but it isn't that great. The Agatha Christie style who dunnit with an all star cast is involving and fun to watch. The tension you feel for the character Marta played well by Armas is unique. So there is an inventiveness that keeps the viewer concentrating for clues and wrapped up in the dynamic of the characters. The in fighting in the family is funny. And the way they turn on her is painfully real. The way nasty relatives are shown may be too close to home for some viewers.Christopher Plummer is amazing actor - he in his late eighties and the rest of the cast hams it up including Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis and Daniel Craig with an exaggerated but intelligible accent. In ""Fierce People"" Chris Evans acted a similar role so it was a bit of a déjà vu how his character turned out.But there are some flaws. The grand explanation with the switching of the medicine is confusing and unconvincing. Also the family wasn't that bad to justify a total disinheriting. If the patriarch wanted to help Marta he didn't have to leave her everything. She was doing a job well and a sizeable legacy would have sufficed. There is a political slant to the story that Agatha Christie wouldn't have had. Here the writer pits the sweet good hearted daughter of an illegal immigrant against the evil white entitled wealthy mercenary people. Too cliched.Despite the flaws it's worth a watch because movies like this aren't that common anymore."
457,"I loved this movie, very clever! It reminded me of the Agatha Christie Poirot or Miss Marple movies. I can't wait till it comes to the small screen so I can see it again!
My only complaint was Daniel Craigs accent, I'm sure it was deliberately referencing someone but I am not sure who?"
458,"Who dun it? knives out is rated a 8/10 so i figured i'd watch it for myself. honestly, this movie is a solid 7 at most. its definitely not the best movie of the year but it has its moments. everyone did shine in their roles, but daniel craigs accent was unnecessary. his british voice would have made the movie much more pleasant and entertaining. at times the movie did drag but that tends to happen in 2+ hour long movies."
459,"Not gonna lie, the plot being revealed halfway through kinda ruined it for me, despite the great performance."
460,"Rating this movie 1 star because 2 hours and 10 minutes is just too long, 0 stars for Rian Johnson for obvious reasons, but giving the cast 10 stars (that includes the location as well).Went in with a open mind but man that was brutal. Where was the mystery, suspense, and thrill?? It took over 1 hour and 10 minutes for things to ramp up but never answered the questions.Clue-board game, Clue-1985 movie, Columbo, and Murder, She Wrote were/are better this dumpster fire."
461,This movie is nothing but garbaaaaaaggggggeee....really you had to use a horrible southern accent to get away from double O...whatever this movie was not good in any way...predictable and stupid...only the bad guy would have picked her up...maybe try...less...only way you could be less worse
462,"No, it wasn't perfect. No it was not Academy Award material. But it was a delightful story with lots of classic whodunnit elements. I thought we got to know each character well and, like in an Agatha Christie novel, fulfilled their roles. I thought Craig did a nice job and kept things moving along. Plummer was good in his limited screen time. Once again, I'm so fed up with people who decide that IMDB presents an opportunity to destroy a valid system by giving a movie such as this a rating of One. Do you really think this film ranks down there with Alligator Women on Venus. That's what the One ratings are for. It's usually because a film gets a little hype and those with no imagination or who are unhappy with their lives feel the need to throw everything off. Use lower ratings, but try to show some objectivity."
463,"What a wonderful who dun-it movie!! The entire cast was superb. Chris Evans did and exceptional job!
**SPOILERS**
Chris Evans was an excellent villain. It's good to see him in roles like this one. I hope to see him play more villains than the goody two shoes, Captain America.
Bravo!! Loved this movie👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽"
464,"This movie had me laughing out loud at numerous spots, and sometimes it was the little things you just catch. To call this a ""murder mystery"" would be deceiving imo because it was more like a comedy or a spoof. I haven't laughed so loud watching a movie in a while like I did with this. From the cracked cell phone to the political arguments, to the car chase (lmao) to the knife attack at the end (which I did see coming since I was accustomed to the vibe and humor by that point), I loved the humor.I also drew many abstractions from Breaking Bad, which Johnson played a pretty big role in directing some of the most famous episodes. That was a nice treat to see the homages.All the actors were great, but especially Craig, who really impressed me here since I'm not the biggest fan of his. But in this, I felt like he really embraced the comedy, humor, and eccentric role perfectly, showing range. The other actors and actresses all played their smaller parts well too, especially the one family member with the cane.8/10"
465,"If you like those ""Who Dunnit"" crime stories and movies a la Agatha Christie you will like Knives Out a lot. Good story, good twists, some funny moments and a top cast - Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curties, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Christopher Plummer to name a few. Production is also on the top, so all in all a good one."
466,"After watching ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" I had little hope for upcoming Rian Johnson films, and then the trailer for ""Knives Out"" came out. I knew I would watch this movie, but it still seemed that Rian Johnson was trying too hard to recover from the bombshell that ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" was. After watching ""Knives Out"" however, I was surprised, even if he was trying too hard to makeup for ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" it certainly paid off. ""Knives Out"" was an engaging and funny movie including a stellar performance from Daniel Craig (although his accent caught me off guard at the start). It paid homage to the ""Whodunnit"" genre but I do not think it was ""A Whodunnit Like No One Has Ever Dunnit"". I felt several moments of the film were very predictable. and cheesy, but is still an overall fun movie.""Knives Out"" follows Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) who was the ""murderer"" in the movie. We later find out she didn't kill Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) and it was all a set-up from Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans). Chris Evans character was entertaining to watch, but writing for his characters dialogue was extremely cheesy and momentarily cringe... MOMENTARILY. Besides his characters introduction and the cafe scene with Marta, Ransom or ""Hugh"" was a good and entertaining character, a great attempt for Chris Evans to be known as Chris Evans not Captain America. Another negative about the movie include ""Hugh did it"" which was frankly an unintentionally laughable moment in the movie.All movies have their flaws, and luckily this movies pros outweighed their cons. The cinematography was fitting for the story, helping immerse. the audience in the story, especially paired with the score. The twist was creative and its comedy didn't seem unnecessarily, unlike most modern movies.The movie knew what it was and followed one overarching theme,""Knives Out"" was entertaining and probably the best movie experience you will have this year.8/10"
467,"""Knives Out"" is for sure one clever and hide the stab whodunit, as the on screen talent and chemistry between the players is plenty to take in. While underneath it all lies and rep tape unfolds as a murder mystery tries to hide. Christopher Plummer is the family patriarch and most famous novelist of mystery and suspense and it's crazy when his 85th birthday party becomes a crime scene of it's own. His assorted offspring which consist of kids and in laws(to name a few Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, and Toni Collette) and these folks start to squabble and dodge the truth.Enter detective Blanc(Daniel Craig) who stalks the case in his own manner as the film twists and turns and reveals things you as the viewer don't see coming, it's like the film is just a tweak of classic murder mysteries as the Drysdale group is so combative and eccentric(also look for a stand alone performance from Ana de Armas) that this picture puts plenty on the viewers plate as many entertaining themes are present."
468,"Predictable... Too long... It should had been a Netflix film, not for movie theatres."
469,"I came for this movie looking for a laugh but ended up satisfied, nevertheless. I don't think this movie should be under comedy. The funny moments during the film could be counted on one hand, two if really pushing it. However, it excels as a whodunit movie. I was surprised when the movie's main mystery was solved halfway through. I thought that was it. However, it unlocked another impressive twist. The things that are left untied are tied and many clues make sense at the end."
470,"The ongoing repeats on UK television of Poirot, Miss Marple, Midsomer Murder etc illustrate a still healthy interest in the 'suspects gather in the library for the unmasking of the criminal' genre and box-office returns in the next few weeks will indicate whether it's one thing to watch in your living room gratis but another to schlepp to the multiplex and shell out good money. My first impression at the opening, as the camera tracked through the grounds of Gotrocks Manor, then entered and trawled past paraphernalia like that seen in Mank's adaptation of Sleuth with Caine and Olivier was that we were in Rip-Off Central but whereas Sleuth was a two-hander here we have a matching set of suspects aka red herrings to banish all thoughts of rip-off. It's well done, glossy, slick but ultimately empty as an election promise."
471,"Rian Johnson is a fantastic director. Even though many criticise him for ruining Star Wars with The Last Jedi, he has proven his skill in previous films like Looper. His new film Knives Out may be his best.Knives Out follows Benoit Blanc, a detective hired to solve the mysterious death of Harlan Thrombey, the patriarch of the eccentric and conflicting Thrombey family.I'm a big fan of the murder mystery genre so I was obviously very excited to this and the ensemble cast increased my anticipation. Rian Johnson has very cleverly and skilfully put together a fantastic homage to the ""whodunnit"" genre. The film has a very old fashioned feeling to it, despite its modern aspects, that is reminiscent of murder mysteries from the 1900s and the Clue board game. The set design, cinematography and costumes built up this incredible atmosphere to the time it's set in.One of the best parts of this movie is the cast. Everyone did a fantastic job as their characters and played off one another exceptionally well. Daniel Craig, with his Southern accent, was really funny at times and his acting was really good especially during the third act. For me, personally, I thought the standout was Ana de Armas. She plays a crucial role in this story and this is the best I've seen her act.Rian Johnson's direction is fantastic throughout as he incorporates a range of style to each shot but it's not just style over substance as his script is witty, hilarious and keeps you invested through the film's entirety. His take of this genre is vastly different from whodunnits in the past which made the experience better in my opinion as I constantly doubted myself on what direction the film was taking.A character I felt was really underutilized was that of Jaeden Martell since he does not contribute much to the film compared to the rest of the cast. Apart from that I don't have any other complaints regarding this film.Knives Out is a really fun time at the theatre. Just the premise of a whodunnit is interesting enough to watch but Rian Johnson's amazing direction, script and ensemble cast make this film shine and unique from previous whodunnits in the past. This is definitely my favourite film of his and cannot wait to see what other ideas he comes up with. Knives Out is one of the best films of the year."
472,"The mystery writer Christopher Plummer has died. Although the police have just about wrapped up their investigation, his nurse, Ana de Armas is nervous; she knows that she had given him the wrong doses of medicine, the antidote was missing from her bag, and he had slashed his throat after arranging with her an elaborate charade so she would would not be suspected. The family and police were satisfied, yet here is the great detective Daniel Craig, holding it open. He has been hired to investigate, although he does not know by whom. The plot thickens when the will is read, and the heir to Plummer's vast fortune is Miss de Armas.Once upon a time, the movie theaters ran full programs of selected short subjects, a feature film, and quite often a second feature. The second features were generally lower-budgeted movies, meant to be rented out to the theaters at a flat rate, and often genre films.... like mystery films. Some of these second features were series, and quite popular; it was no unknown for people to go to a show specifically for the second feature, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, or a Charlie Chan mystery, featuring stars who perhaps did not shine brightly enough for the major studios' A pictures, but would bring in the customers.Eventually, the program shortened: no more selected short subjects, no more second feature. Nowadays, a movie show usually consists of a feature film and previews of coming attractions. Yet, long as it is, and with such a varied and interesting cast as it has -- Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and half a dozen others -- this movie strikes me as a B picture, with an ornate plot, some small and gratifying witticisms.... in short, a superior example of the form.If you are wise enough to see this movie, you will be sorely confused, as mystery is piled atop mystery, and how to untangle them all. I know I was. At the end, all will be revealed, and the journey from start to finish will have turned out to be worthwhile."
473,"To put it mildly, director Rian Johnson's experience behind the camera last time around was a highly interesting and career defining one.Charged with taking over the new Star Wars saga in the form of the hotly debated The Last Jedi, Johnson found himself victim of countless online trolls, critics and universe obsessed fanboys, as his franchise turning feature found itself scrutinized like very few films do.With its issues, The Last Jedi was still a film with some great moments and interesting ideas and the man who gave us Brick and Looper has always been a fine filmmaker with runs on the board, so it's great to see the keen aficionado of mystery and whodunits deliver an enjoyable and fun romp without any pre-conceived constraints holding him back.Knives Out is the type of mystery film of old, filled with a rag-tag collection of characters and possible suspects as Johnson builds off the foundation of authors such as Agatha Christie and filmmakers like Alfred Hitchcock, to concoct an extremely well-written and acted film that is sure to insight much fandom moving forward.It's not a film of much lasting substance, despite some already looking to deep into its underlying political themes born out of the Trump era, but Johnson and his cast are just having an old-fashioned good time here as Daniel Craig's ""KFC"" southern detective Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas's (Brazilian, Ecuadorian or other various countries of origin) nurse Marta Cabrera team up to uncover the mystery of author Harlan Thromby's untimely demise.With Craig on top form here and going the whole nine yards and de Armas continuing to prove to us all she could well be the ""next big thing"", Knives Out is a joy to watch whenever they get too command the screen and surrounded by one of 2019's best ensembles, that is highlighted by an against type Chris Evans going to the dark side with his loathsome Ransom Drysdale and Michael Shannon dialing it back as Thromby's son Walt, Knives Out is always watchable.It's a shame Johnson included one too many characters into his film though, as not all of the supports feel that needful to the story, particularly Jaeden Martell's teenage internet troll (regardless of what Johnson intended, this feels like a character getting a say at the Star Wars keyboard warriors) and Katherine Langford's granddaughter Meg, these type of characters feel like mere wallpaper in a film that shines best when focusing on its best components which remains throughout de Armas and the usually gruff Craig.The other slightly disappointing aspect to this murder mystery is the fact that its final pay-off doesn't exactly come off as much of a surprise and at over two hours, it would've been nice to have felt more rewarded with a genuinely mind-blowing reveal, but they're high expectations born from a film with a great premise and some lovingly staged ideas.Final Say -A fun statement from a director who seemingly had the world against him with his last film, Knives Out is a well-played whodunit and while the film doesn't quite stick the landing, there's much to enjoy leading up to it thanks to some great central turns and whip smart script work.3 1/2 doughnut holes out of 5"
474,"It is even better after watching it twice.I like to start my reviews with the positive sites of a movie. First of all knives out is a good movie with a few weaknesses but i will talk about them later. So lets start with the things i like in this movie. The characters are very well writen and very diffrent. The costum design is really good in my opinon because every character has his own dress code wich makes the characters visual diffrent. The editing is also very well done and underlines the important things on the screen without being to quick when jumping from one shot to another. The story has a few weaknesses but is very solid and picks up a lot of speed at the end. Another positive thing about this movies are the actors because they all played their characters very well.The story is (after watching it a second time) amazing there are so many little hints in the plot that i only realised after watching it twice.the only negative thing i can is that the story may lacks some speed at the end.in summary good murder mystery movie with a little weaknesses but with good characters acting,editing and set design."
475,"It was a long movie comparitively, but the brilliance of the Direction and the videography made it so pleasant it cannot go unnoticed. The storyline was hell of twist man! I mean I swear I never thought I'd see Chris Evans as a villain in any movie but woah! this movie just made it real with awesome plot twist. This story would've made a helluva book if written as a novel... It'd be like one of those antique pieces of like Sherlock Holmes or a book by Agathe Christie. I loved this movie, totally recommended."
476,"I can't understand how anyone is rating this 9/10. The cast and production suggest this should be quality but after a strong start, the story falls flat. Standouts: Daniel Craig's terrible southern accent, an utterly stupid vomit based plot device for poor Ana de Armas, a make up artist who needed to be fired for caking every cast member over the age of 35 in an inch of foundation and an overly contrived finale which isn't really much of a surprise."
477,"I loved this AWESOME ensemble cast, murder mystery thriller, the talent is mega here with a huge cast of fantastic actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween franchise,The Fog) & Daniel Craig (James Bond) & Chris Evans (Captain America) & Ana De Armas (Knock Knock) & Michael Shannon (Man of Steel) & Don Johnson (Machete) & Toni Collette (Hereditary) & to top the rest ensemble off with Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell & Movie Legend Christopher Plummer!!!! A hell of a great cast.The exciting, interesting & super smart story is about a renowned crime novelist Harlin Thrombey (an excellent Christopher Plummer) is found dead at his huge mansion estate just after his 85th birthday & a Brilliant & debonair private Detective Benoit Blanc (a Brilliant Daniel Craig) is mysteriously enlisted to investigate. From the crazy & dysfunctional family & his devoted staff, Blanc has to sift through a huge web of red herrings & self-serving lies to uncover the truth behind Harlan's death. Each actor brings so much richness & detail to their character, it's a beautiful piece of filmmaking in my opinion with a truly stunning setting with the massive mansion setting that is just beautiful, old looking & richly detailed & a place you would want to explore, the look of this movie is gorgeous too with a lovely cozy look & set during the Autumn & simply lovely cinematography. The real knockout performance here is from the beautiful Ana De Armas, this lady is truly a phenomenal actor who really carries to the whole movie & interacts with everyone of the huge ensemble cast of characters & holds it all together perfectly, her performance is fantastic as she struggles to help others & keep secrets & its a great performance. I was also really impressed by Chris Evans as he's moved onto such a different role than what we know him as (Captain America) & it's a fun part from a guy who is only really known for his Marvel movies work, he's a great actor here. This is also the best I've seen Daniel Craig in a film, he's excellent here as the smart Colombo type Detective with a deep southern accent, another great performance. Jamie Lee Curtis is another legend of Cinema & as usual she's great here & alot of fun, always been a Jamie lee Curtis fan since i grew up watching the Halloween films & The Fog. The whole cast is terrific fun & the movie is a huge piece of entertaining fun & with a real cozy atmosphere.
A perfect late night murder mystery Thriller that really the whole family can enjoy as it's loaded with dark funny humour & wacky characters. Loved it."
478,"""Knives Out,"" (2019). Directed and written by Rian Johnson. Starring, Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Don Johnson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. This is a movie worth watching several times! In fact, it reminded me of sitting in front of our brand new 1952 Philco black and white snowy, stripey first tv, watching a 40s ""The Butler Did It"" film. Complete with a New Orleans creepy mansion and a cast of devious and deceitful characters. And a convoluted, intricate plot. It had more twists and turns than a dog's hind leg. But for me, my favorite character was Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig. Who would have thought that he could nail a Southern accent? I am thinking that the setting was supposed to be New Orleans, complete with architecture and props. However, Daniel's accent was not quite a Nawlins accent. But close enough! I loved this film. I give it 5 of 5 stars."
479,"Knives out was alright, but still immensely overrated because of a little ""Revolutionary"" twist."
480,"A very great film, from the events and dialogues and the sequence of the show and the performance of the actors in addition to their creativity in photography, as for the beginning, the narration of events is vague and that is required in such a kind of movies to attract your attention and attract you to the upcoming events, so it was very fun, I enjoyed every minute of it.that's what should we call a movie. thank for all who worked on it."
481,Few movies out there that are very entertaining/interesting and this is one of them. similar to Sherlock Holmes. Daniel Craig's American accent is very funny though.
482,"Knives Out is a brilliant crime movie that actually keeps the suspense nearly air tight up until the final credits.The acting was quite top notch and all of the cast delivered their scenes delightfully. The film progresses quite quickly and when you think the show's over, you're taken on another thrilling ride.The infusion of comedy makes this more a joy to watch alongside the racketeering of rich large families which was equally brought to the foray.While the key piece of the plot hinged on the main character's medical condition, which seemed quite fictitious, it added a new perspective to the movie."
483,"I could not understand the truth before the climax.
So the scene that the detective solves the mystery was so excited and satisfying."
484,"This movie is very well made in most aspects. the reason i didn't like it more is because i predicted almost everything, sometimes LONG before the reveal. i also was barely laughing at the funny parts. but i still thought it was a good story overall. i just wish it could have surprised me. maybe i just watch too many movies. (1 viewing, 4/5/2020)"
485,"The trailers for this film were great! Very quick, witty, and clever. The movie.... slow, dull, and predictable.The only good performance is Toni Collette who plays a Gwyneth Paltrow type. Everyone else was wasted.And Daniel Craig as a Southerner? Please!From now on just watch the trailers and skip the film."
486,"My sense of humor must be atypical or others are doing more drugs than me, I didn't find much humor in it. The best part of the movie was the ending. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas gave great performances, the rest were adequate."
487,"Like all crime movies, this contains plot twists, some major, some minor. I can say that most of the spoilers were, quite honestly, surprising to me, and I did like the movie overall and Craig's and Chris Evans' performance were good. However, I did predict one of the main plot twists from the beginning which made the movie from that point on to be not as enjoyable as it was before. Although because I didn't reach the right conclusions from the plot twist that I knew, the hole in the donut if you will, was coming, it was still enjoyable as a whole (pun intended.). So I do recommend watching it. If you're looking for a mystery movie that is amazing watch murder on the orient express. The Suchet version was more enjoyable for me but you could also read the novel."
488,I'm hardly impressed/entertain with a movie and this is for sure one of them
489,"The whodunit is one of modern cinema's most underserved genres, and it's always exciting when someone decides to make one.The movie features an excellent performance by Daniel Craig as a laid back southern detective plus a bunch of other excellent performances by the suspects. The movie is mildy satiric of the wealthy, but mainly it's about the mystery and the characters.While I liked this movie, I didn't like it quite as much as I expected to considering I love whodunits and it got rave reviews. It's no Last of Sheila. But it is the best whodunit that's come out for years and very entertaining."
490,It's a great movie. just one annoying thing i wanted to say is Daniel Craig was'nt right person this role.Maybe an older or suitable person could be better. Too exaggerated role. He is not that guy. But the rest of it great welldone 👏👏👏 ps : I love Daniel Craig
491,"Don't waste your time, unless your their to look at pretty actors on a pretty set deliver the most banal plot I've seen all year. Luxuriously edited to have no regard for my time, and boringly predictable. There were no actual red herrings besides the maid, and that late comer sibling. This all seems like a changed white savior tale. This is apparent by the ending. The female protagonist is put on a VERY high moral pedestal. And this film says ABSOLUTELY NOTHING original. It's quite frankly sad that this is in talks for best film."
492,"When I was watching this movie I enjoyed most of the dialogue the character interactions but then when it was all said and done I realized it didn't amount to much. There were way too many convenient plot devices that made it seem a little contrived. I think the whole thing fell apart at the end when to me it stopped being believable and turned a little silly.Rian Johnson is probably one of the most politically correct filmmakers in Hollywood right now and I think that greatly limits the effectiveness of his movies because of the rules he sets for himself. I think there were a lot of good opportunities squandered in Knives Out. There were some very interesting characters that were wasted in the favor of the story being focused on a very bland albeit pretty one. For me it just ultimately didn't deliver a satisfying experience, mostly entertaining but forgettable. 6/10"
493,"I'll be honest, I was expecting more. The movie is ok, predictable to a certain degree. Daniel Craig's accent really started to grate. Solid enough, but not sure it was worth such high praise and acclaim."
494,"Very good whodunnit but it's a one time watch, a highly enjoyable watch nonetheless. However, does every damn American movie has to say something about Trump. Make no mistake this is a straight-up mystery film but it has an overarching theme, which is a little irritating. I guess directors feel like they need to be on the right side of politics to be engaging. This reminds me of one of the critics' review of 'Dragged Across Concrete', in which he called it a right-wing propaganda. I guess other films could be called left-wing propaganda? Maybe just maybe, film-makers should focus on films, rather than social commentary, especially when it's not particularly profound and are based on over-all ""feelings"" among the artistic types and the enlightened. That being said, if you also notice this trend, don't let it stop you from watching this. As stated before - a very witty and escapist whodunnit!"
495,"I didn't expect much from this movie at first, then by the interim i was quite enticed by the storytelling and the unraveling of different events,All lead to a good premise tbh..I was extremely disheartened how it ended with all the potential it had carried through, I don't mind a good narrative or social message in a movie, but if that entails an erosion of the solemnity of a movie, i'm better without one."
496,Perfectly mediocre. Didn't hate it. Didn't love it. Watch it if you've already seen everything else.
497,"Solid entertainment. I was kept pretty much interested for two hours. I really liked the first one-third: the mix of characters, their personalities and backstories, the beautiful house and detailed interior decor.Then came the girl who vomits if she lies (frankly ... ew). One expects things to get really good from here - this could be a special ability that helps our detective piece together the mystery. Except it is quickly revealed that there is no mystery and the whole case, motivation process and outcome, is played out in front of the audience before the movie is half through. What?I held out hope when the morphine overdose was revealed. No throat has been slit, so surely, something is left to solve. Nope. Turns out to be wholly a suicide. We realize everything before this is kind of useless, and follow the main character on her quest to escape culpability (except I did think she was at fault and should be caught, so was not really convinced).The middle section meanders and loses itself in inheritance drama. A blackmailer appears - is murdered. I frankly could not figure out if the second murder was done to hurt or help the main character - could be either and I did not much care. Only wanted to see the ending where I was sure there is a twist.The last part of the movie picked up and was almost as good as the first, although the denouement was somewhat predictable (many plot points follow so much hinting as to make them predictable, even if they were not at the start). The black sheep turns out to be ... really the black sheep, I had high hopes that the most like grandson to the grandfather would continue to foster the family's special bond to the main character, nope that was all false. Also: overused motifs of the game Go, being a good person, seeing through if knives are props, etc.Final note on what I perceive to be the misplaced idea of guilt in this movie. Main character did not directly kill the grandpa but did indirectly cause his misguided suicide. In a civil lawsuit, would she not still be held accountable (somewhat) for his death? So the slayer's rule would still work? Consider also the case for her negligence and that she had champagne.And in the alternate scenario, even if she was the one to administer what she thought was medicine (actually morphine), she would not be held guilty if it's proven someone swapped out the drugs? (which is possible given the eye witness of the housekeeper).It is tragic that the old man must die either way. Overall, pretty good/not bad, really good performances by the cast, less than solid plot (if it were more of a comedy it would have worked - alas), too much vomiting, and too indulgent towards the main character who at best I think is a neutral not morally superior person."
498,"After seeing Uncut Gems the previous night, my wife and I needed something a little more fun. This is a visual pleasure but a light light script.If you like a little weird, You are going to enjoy Toni Collette in this film, particularly her interaction with JL Curtis.JL Curtis would have stolen the film if she were given the same screen time as Daniel Craig - She's just got the right role for her to be endlessly enjoyable.I also really enjoyed the shady grandchild role of Hugh or ""Ransom"" that Chris Evans offers as well as the patriarch played by Chris Plummer, Amanda's Dad.Many many scenes are filled with campy light fun and enjoyable acting. But it did feel as if a producer thought the film was running long, so the writers were directed to have Daniel Craig talk out the conclusion to the mystery - like someone trying to cram in words to the end of a thank you note.From this film, my wife and I wanted just a little more for the evening. We immediately then set out to see Eastwood's Richard Jewell. As our evening closed, it was difficult to remember a single scene of Knives Out after having Eastwood's fully engaging film take hold of your short-term memory."
499,"'Knives Out' performs as a pleasing entertainment without ever creating characters or situations that require any real amount of belief on the part of the viewer. A whimsy of a film that doesn't overstay itself and offers the chance for a few ripe moments of both character and physical comedy.In every respect I found 'Knives Out' to be adequately interesting and amusing without ever exceeding that mark.In my estimation it is a strong 5/10 heading upwards to a 6 but I think that frankly there were no stand out performances, or remarkable direction, writing, technical credits, etc: so a good 5/10 film that I would tentatively recommend to prior fans of murder mysteries of the Agatha Christie variety and to fans of the director; and to those who generally like a sprinkling of mildly quirky material."
500,"I'm in 2 minds about this film.On the one hand, the story and plot were very good, on the other hand, it could've been a lot more entertaining in the build up.
The film had many stars that barely showed their worth, this frustrated me and eventually I started to find the film boring. I just wanted it to end to see who the culprit was."
501,Would be a lot better if we didn't have to listen to that awful false voice put in by Daniel Craig.
502,I actually dozed off twice during the movie. I thought the movie was slow and not enough action. To me it was boring.
503,"Once again I left a Rian Johnson film asking myself, did I enjoy that or not? My first instinct was 'no', and remains the same ever since. The film has all the elements of a classic whodunnit story, but the film turns out underwhelming. The biggest problem is within an hour, we are told what happened. The main mystery is solved, and the film transforms from a ""Whodunnit"" into a ""How They Got Away With It"". However, being a Rian Johnson flick there is no way he would not try to ""subvert expectations"". Once you realize this, the outcome is very predictable. This happening halfway really hurts ""Knives Out"" because it takes you almost completely out of the film, which is something Rian is also guilty of doing in his previous film. Figuring out the ""murderer"" by simply paying attention to something as simple as screen presence and on-screen time, downgrades the mystery element of the film. Other successful comic-style whodunnits which featured a large cast of big name performers, had all the suspects together with the investigator for the majority of the film. This is not the case with ""Knives Out"". I could easily dismiss over half the suspects in ""Knives Out"" based on how little involvement their characters were given. Too few lines, rarely mentioned, scarcely involved or seen, little to zero motive = easy to dismiss. In ""Clue"", every character had a good motive and could easily have been the murderer(s). ""Knives Out"", you have maybe 3 good suspects and everyone else can be dismissed. In any whodunnit, a key factor is the setting and location of the crime. The house in ""Knives Out"" is a character on it's own, which is never used to its full potential. In fact, when the film leaves the house over halfway through, I found myself longing for the film to return to the house. In ""Clue"", the house is dark, creepy, and adds a lot to scenes of tension and comedy. The Knives Out house's foreground is well balanced to scenes of comedy as well as scenes of crime. The house in ""Knives Out"" is well designed for a whodunnit, but outside of the cool circle of knives, the house is never used to its full potential in this comedy murder mystery. Unlike the ""Star Wars"" franchise, ""Knives Out"" is more of Rian Johnson's territory. There is some cleverness, decent comedy, the story is fresh and original, with solid performances, but at the close of ""Knives Out"" it's underwhelming. I'll stick with ""Clue"". Also, I LOVE Daniel Craig, but Johnson has him do a charming southern gentlemen style accent. Or as it's commonly referred to more many times in the flick as a KFC Colonel Sanders accent. Really Rian? Daniel is British. Have Daniel be British! British have charming accents too. Daniel Craig reminded me the whole time of Tom Hanks in ""The Ladykillers"". Trust me I was not the only audience member asking this at the end of the film why on earth would you give Daniel Craig this accent."
504,"I like whodunits, movie or bookwise, so it was a no-brainer to watch Knives Out in premiere. The acting, costumes and scenery was spot on but the plot was way too predictable for a whodunit. From the moment Chris Evans began with his lines there was no more guessing, and the roles of the family members didn't hold up because literally nobody was seen as a suspect in my eyes. From the moment Ransom asked Marta if she had checked her mails, the gig was up and this was not even remotly close towards the finale so in my eyes a lost chance. Non the less, very enjoyable movie and time flew while watching. Daniel Craig was candy to my eyes with his accent, the chemistry between him and Ana de Armas was holding strong, maybe due the fact that they are playing together in Bond 25, so that's a plus. Would recommend."
505,"This movie isn't bad but it's not good. I didn't get my hopes up and I was still disappointed. The Director and Editor both did a pretty good job constructing and piecing the story together. However, the Director did not do a great job with the camera. . The actors did their best but again, The Director failed to use them in the right way. It also comes with a disjointed mix of politics and attempted clumsy messages.Skip, wait for tv"
506,"Waste of time and talent. A nonsense plot that will make you DIE waiting for this to end. Ive heard of actors/actresses doing a movie for a lark,this is defnitely one of those."
507,"This movie actually does something quite interesting, it tells you whodunit right up front. To be honest this took me by surprise and I was pleased to find out that what follows is where the mystery starts actually unraveling. Actors are all great in their roles , although most are barely on screen and that's a shame with such a great cast . But it flows very well and things find a way to make the audience react at the right moments , this is due to some nicely directed moments and some perfectly read dialogue. I would have loved this film and given it a much higher score if it just had a little something more . If the twist wasn't so damn noticable to the point of making you say 'it can't be that because it's to obvious' . If there was just a tad more meat on its bones. I'm being a tad picky , it's a fun and perfect way to enjoy a couple hours. Go check it out."
508,"I don't understand reviews that are 10/10 .. Shouldn't they be for mind blowers ?This movie is fun, its undeniably a well thought out clean piece of cinema . a ten no ..If your into who done its . go see it .. Its fun .."
509,"This is good - but it isn't great. Ana de Armas competently, if not vibrantly, takes centre stage with Daniel Craig - sporting a deep Kentuckian accent - playing the Poirot-esque private detective role. Chris Evans leads the remainder of this accomplished, if somewhat under-utilised cast in a murder-mystery caper that doesn't quite have the brio I'd hoped for. It moves along well enough, though and is good fun to watch. It just doesn't quite catch fire. It dips a bit in the middle too, and could probably lose about 20 minutes without compromising the story very much (if at all). You won't guess the ending - unless you have a crystal ball - so it's certainly worth going to see."
510,"'Knives Out' is a mostly-light-hearted timeless ensemble ""whodunnit?"" Essentially, Blanc (Craig), Elliott (Stanfield) and Wagner (Segan) are investigating the death of the patriarch of the Thrombey family, Harlan (Plummer). Thankfully, there's plenty of flashbacks in the first hour, so Plummer does get some screen time. We then meet the extended family and start to unravel various potential motives and inconsistencies in their stories.The cast is huge and all solid - Marta (de Armas) as Harlan's nurse, Linda (Lee Curtis) and Walt (Shannon) as Harlan's children; Richard (Johnson), Joni (Collette) and Donna (Lindhome) as their partners; Randsom (Evans), Meg (Langford) and Jacob (Martell) as Harlan's grandchildren. I think that the main 12 characters - needless to say, not everyone gets enough time to shine, as the focus is on Blanc and Marta trying to piece everything together.This is Johnson's first film since 'The Last Jedi' and it's very assured - excellent set design and cinematography, with a simple score. The hose is literally a life-size Cluedo game. The film drags a tiny bit in the 2nd act, but comes home strong. There's plenty of fun had by the cast and Craig clearly relishes the non-Bond role - even if his Southern accent gets annoying at times! Satisfying ending - nothing revolutionary, but enjoyable. I think we'll be seeing more of Ana de Armas in the future."
511,"Knifes Out has more twists and turns than San Francisco's curvy Lombard Street. Once you think you've figured out who did this mysterious killing of an 85-year-old crime novelist, then your thoughts are discarded and you immediately think another suspect did the mortal deed.
Knives Out is a clever movie with an honest, plausible script. The actors are brilliant, and the dialogue is top-notch. But for those who get uncomfortable with an excessively talkie setting (and what who-done-it movie doesn't have a lot of dialogue), then this film may not be for you.
Knifes Out has its merits, and it is entertaining. As far as breaking new ground, this one isn't it. But pay attention to the curves in the plot and you might find yourself richly rewarded."
512,"**Probably Spoilers**Like J.J. Abrams I do not get the appeal of Rian Johnson. The story as it is, really has nothing to do with the murder mystery (which isn't really a mystery -- you can pretty much guess what it's about in the first 10 minutes), but more so about a singular character.The film moves from one scene to the next, telling you every little thing that is happening rather than showing you -- a major flaw in the past ten years of cinema. Movies used to show you a story, now they are all about telling you the story rather than allowing it to unfold with good acting.I was bored about 15 minutes in and by 30 minutes I had just decided to skip all the way to the end (not that I had seemingly missed much) and sure enough the outcome was what I thought it was going to be. As I stated above, in the first 10 minutes you ought be able to at least put together what's going to happen much like you could with Shutter Island.Not really sure how people compare this to a good Agatha Christy novel, and in many ways this is like a very poorly written mix between The Orient Express, Clue, and the Last Express (the game by Jordan Mechner). Boorish, juvenile, kind of pointless and not at all worth the time it takes to watch it for free on Prime or Netflix.I'm not sure if this was an apology to Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer for their ""roles"" in Star Wars, and supposedly somewhere in this film was an underlying trolling to the Star Wars fans who hated the Last Jedi -- if there was I completely missed it, but probably because certain folks just can't meme.OH... and I'm not sure what the random conversation about social issues and politics were about, perhaps as a jab at more conservative minded people, but quite frankly any talk of politics in movies is just a flat out turn off anymore. It's bad enough that the alphabet networks and cram it down our throats, as well as the social engineering platforms 24/7, but I would personally like to have a break from such things when I'm entering into another world, not have it subtly dropped for whatever reasons...Plus it makes it really difficult to watch over again as no one will care in ""x"" years anyhow as most of the commentary are pulled from the moments trending on twitter at the time of writing.Otherwise, 45 minutes of my life gone including the time it took me to write up this review -- but I like to have an excuse to keep up the practice of writing, so hooray me. At least I didn't give this movie and Rian anymore of my time, and nor will I be bothering to in the future."
513,"My first expectation was this is going to be an ""ok"" movie with remarkable cast (sorry), but oh boi was i wrong. This movie gave me hard chills from every little reveals to the big reveals, some scenes are very funny, none of the jokes were cringe, it's just soo well-written, can't give enough credit to whoever wrote this movie. You know after i watched Jumanji i thought ""the only movie i'll watch in cinema on December after this is either Star wars or Little women"", but did i made a GREAT decision to go to this one. The only downside for me is there was some scenes that contains great information but i was too distracted by these familiar actors and actresses lol"
514,"One of the more entertaining movies of the year. A well made quirky whodunit.
Liked a lot -
Characters were eclectic, although not too original, but were very entertaining. Daniel Craig's character, as a hired PI, was my favorite. His Southern accent caught me off guard at first. I'm guessing him and Chris Evens took these roles to get past their James Bond and Captain America characters. A nice departure for both.
Very strong acting all the way around, however the lead female actor, Ana de Armas stole the show. She had some great emotional close ups that were very captivating. This is the first movie I noticed her in but I will look for her now in others.
The pace of the file was strong from beginning to end. One of the few films over the last year that I lost track of time and was fully immersed in.
Good for all ages, which was nice since I had a 12 year old with me. All of the family enjoyed the film.So so -
The whodunit kept me engaged until the end, but the plot did have some holes. I was OK with them since they didn't play a big role in the overall story line. Also, the move was moving fast, so I soon forgot about them.Dislike -
One of the main reasons I couldn't give this 10 stars (besides the plot holes) is that the movie had the charters talk about present day politics at the dinner table. I'm very liberal and the message that was being supported was liberal as well, but I go to (comedy) movies to get away from politics. It wasn't needed and was a turn off for me. I thought the movie did the same thing, but in a much better and subtle way, when all of the family claimed that the Latino nurse (the main caregiver of the murdered father, played by Ana de Armas) was part of their family, but couldn't remember where the nurse's family was from (a running joke through out the film as the characters told what happened from their point of view). Or how the family didn't want the nurse to be at the funeral, but everyone claimed to the nurse's face that they voted that she should be allowed to attend (another running joke). I thought these more subtle ways did a great job showing how the family felt about ""the help"", making the more direct approach at the dinner table feel preachy (didn't fit the mood of the quirky comedy). The same is true about one of the characters (the grandson of the murdered grandfather). I won't go into details, but you will get my point when you see the movie. That ways over the top and not needed either."
515,Like Sherlock Holmes with comedy at its best. A simple story with all that twist with humor make you think and chuckle...and laugh many times.
516,What a brilliant and exciting movie after so long time. Suspense. Must watch movie
517,"A very disappointing film with a love if Agatha Christie and a all star cast settle down to watch a great murder mystery. What you get with the subtly of a sledge hammer is white America bad immigrants good
If I want a political lecture I'll go to YouTube
Keep propaganda out
I wonder who produced this"
518,When they first unveiled what happened I found it to be underwhelming but boy oh boy it kept me at the edge till the very end! Superb!
519,"Lazy script. First half is a thin plot Line with inane, almost futile, dialogue and scenes that add nothing to advance the story. No subtlety, no cleverness. Daniel Craig's southern accent is not at all amusing.Second half (all of 45 minutes) is Daniel Craig narrating how it all went down.And this was nominated for best original screenplay? Bad year I guess."
520,"But this was brilliant. I thought the acting was excellent, especially from Daniel Craig who really impressed me and Ana De Armas who was great.I'd definitely recommend everyone watch this gem of a whodunit and enjoy it as much as I did.Great film."
521,"This movie had my mind twisted more than once , the atmosphere,music and even the clothing of the actors were all playing in harmony. I loved every minute of this incredible piece of art !"
522,"This is a very entertaining movie. Great cast too. I am not attached to any one genre. I like a good movie. This is one of them. I wish the average rating was higher.
The movie was very refreshing: it seems that last 3.5 years (after a certain political event) Hollywood has been depressed. Well, this movie definitely reverses the trend."
523,"I was honestly so excited to see this movie! I love a good thriller/ mystery movie & the cast looked fabulous! I am so disappointed, I did not like it at all, it went for way to long, was boring, bland and very underwhelming. I was waiting for something interesting to happen or a good twist to occur the whole film... I didn't think it was a very exciting movie at all... I wanted to like it so bad but I really didn't. I would have to say this was a total miss for me..."
524,"Rian Johnson is one of the best writer/directors in Hollywood and this movie proves it. The plot of this movie is brilliantly crafted, tense, and engaging. It always stays one step ahead even if you think you know whats about to happen. It was also funny with great performances from Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig. I'm glad this movie was successful because I can't wait to see another story in this world."
525,"A little funny evening crime movie, settled in an old fashioned narration style. The interesting thing is, that Johnsons creates a mood around this simple plot, that makes this piece of movie remarkable. The cast of course makes it much more better, most of it all its Ana de Armas."
526,The detective is very logic he solve the problems like pro. At the beginning the detective is look like stupid. But after it when the film end he very smart
527,"Nobody but Ransom knew about the ATTEMPT to change the medicine.Why - on what basis - would Fran, who only saw Ransom shuffling trough the bag, try to extort him?The old man had a cut throat. Why even ask her cousin to get the toxicology report for her?
On top of this illogical unfolding of events, the toxicology report was clean! That should have stopped her even acting on suspicion.Other weird stuff: when did Ransom have time to torch the lab or kill Fran (who meets the very presumptuously suspected attempted murderer alone and unarmed)? Wasn't he WITH Marta?Apart from that I did feel it was a bit boring at times. What is the viewer supposed to do if the ""murder"" is explained early on and no other suspects are presented with opportunity? Sure, they all have reason but none is shown to could have done it.Nonetheless I spun my yarn of how readily the old man cut his own throat and had a plan ready for Marta's escape. Changed up medicine was the first idea and it smelled like a plan to smoke out the rats in his family. It wasn't though, just ironic heroics to deliver an emotional punch of him committing suicide in vain.I liked the atmosphere and the acting.
My rating is more a 7,51. The cast made me round up."
528,Rian Johnson is one of the great magicians of our time. #KnivesOut is required viewing and a perfect night at the movies.
529,"Knives Out is a star studded whodunit where all the suspects are gathered in the mansion.It is a knowing variation of the board game Cluedo which itself was turned into a movie in the mid 1980s. The victim is best selling crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer.)A private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) has been hired to find out if the writer's death really was murder or as the police suspect, a suicide. A recently changed will might lead to a motive.This comedy mystery is reliant on Harlan's personal nurse Marta (Ana de Armas) a woman who physically throws up if she tells a lie.Following the conventions of many Agatha Christie mysteries, Knives Out turns a lot of the essential ingredients of the genre in his head by adding several layers to the story.However it is not original as there have been several movies that have twisted the crime mystery genre. It also feel slightly laboured and in the end it is superficial as Craig's accent which at times becomes grating, Chris Evans playboy character is underwritten and he struggles among other cast members such as Don Johnson, Michael Shannon and Jamie Leigh Curtis.responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do."
530,"We all love a good whodunit, the most famous sleuths like Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple deducing a murderer from an A-list cast of suspects, well, now comes this modern day movie in the same league, written and directed by Rian Johnson (Brick Lane, Looper, Star Wars: Episode VII - The Last Jedi). Basically, wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is celebrating his 85th birthday and invites his family to his mansion for his party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds him dead, apparently having slit his own throat. An anonymous figure hires private detective Benoit Blanc (Golden Globe nominated Daniel Craig) to investigate. Blanc learns that Harlan had alienated many of the family: : he had threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson) for having an affair; cut off the allowance of his daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette) for stealing money, meant for the tuition for his granddaughter Megan ""Meg"" (Katherine Langford); fired his youngest son Walter ""Walt"" (Michael Shannon) from his publishing company; and cut his lazy grandson Ransom (Chris Evans) out of his will. Flashbacks reveal that after the party Harlan's nurse Marta Cabrera (Golden Globe nominated Ana de Armas) accidentally injected Harlan with a fatal dose of morphine. Minutes from death, Harlan told Marta how to avoid suspicion, making it appear he was still alive after she had driven home, then he slit his own throat. Because Marta cannot lie without vomiting, she avoids answering the questions of Detective Lieutenant Elliot (Lakeith Stanfield), but Blanc asks her to assist in his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence, but is only partially successful. The family, including Harlan's eldest daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), is shocked to hear from Harlan's lawyer Alan Stevens (Frank Oz) that Harlan left everything to Marta. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom tricks Marta into confessing to him but offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys realize that, under the slayer rule, Marta will lose the inheritance if she killed Harlan, but Blanc tells them that they all are still suspects. They try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance. Marta receives a blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's toxicology report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc spots her and Ransom, the police catch and arrest Random, while Blanc tells Marta that Wanetta ""Great Nana"" Thrombey (K Callan), Harlan's mother, saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's upstairs rooms on the night of his death. Marta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged. Marta confesses everything to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds Fran had the copy of the full toxicology report. Marta is about to confess everything to the family, but Blanc stops after finding something missing in the report. He brings Marta, Ransom and the police to a room to reveal his deductions. Ransom learned that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, so he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials so she would kill Harlan with an overdose, so she would not gain the inheritance. However, Marta, an experienced nurse, administered the correct medicine without reading the labels. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later witnesses Ransom swapping the vials back and sent him the blackmail note. Realising that Marta had given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom passed on the blackmail note to Marta, removing the address and time. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy the evidence of Marta's innocence and burned Fran's copy of the toxicology report. He drugged Fran with morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder. Marta receives a call from the hospital and says that Fran is alive. Believing that Fran will implicate him, Ransom angrily confesses, and vows revenge. Marta vomits on Ransom; she lied that Fran had survived, and tricked Ransom into confessing. In anger, he grabs a knife from the wall to attack and kill her, but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. Ransom is taken into custody, while Marta watches him and the Thrombey family members from the balcony of what is now her mansion. Also starring Jaeden Martell as Jacob Thrombey, Noah Segan as Trooper Wagner, Riki Lindhome as Donna Thrombey, M. Emmet Walsh as Mr. Proofroc, Marlene Forte as Mrs. Cabrera and Shyrley Rodriguez as Alicia Cabrera, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a voice cameo as Detective Hardrock. Craig is likeably comical as the detective from the Deep South (he sounds like Foghorn Leghorn lol), and other cast members like Curtis, Collette and Armas look like they are having a blast, Evans get some of the best lines throwing insults. The whodunit is a well-trodden genre, but with the addition of a witty script and some deadpan humour along the way, this is a terrific refreshing take on it, I admit you have to really concentrate to get the concluding twist, but I'd like to see a follow-up, overall an entertaining murder mystery. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for Rian Johnson, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy. Very good!"
531,"I'm a fan of ""whodunnit"" genre, really like to work my brain and Clue in all it's craziness is one of my all time favorites. Not to say I don't like the more serious ones, I loved Gosford Park, Name of the Rose etc. This seemed like a great movie to see.Starts out pretty good, fast paced and quirky, the cast is great, but for me the movie fell apart as soon as they showed the murder/death/suicide. It was quite early to the movie and you know at that point that this can't be the whole truth, even tho you've just seen exactly how it happened. After that it's just guessing what lead to it or how they cover up for it.There are tons of clues on the way, a few of them very obvious ones and you kind of know quite early on who actually is to blame, you just aren't sure why. And it's a bit problematic for a whodunnit as the rest of the cast don't really seem very probable murderer. There is basically just one very unlikable character (ok, maybe two, but the other is too small part to be the murderer).But even tho the clues are quite obvious, the path to conclusion is everything but. It was somewhat interesting to watch everything unfold, but a certain key character had such a small part (Fran) that guessing everything seems like a very difficult task.What comes to acting and direction I think most did ok, but what started out as fast paced quirky show, went somewhat flat in the middle. Pace slowed down, Daniel Craig in my opinion delivered quite stale performance after starting out being more interesting. Direction wasn't quirky enough to be a proper comedy after all, only delivering a few good laughs. Most of the time the movie was just a crime drama.Could've used some trimming at over two hours long, I did feel drowsy halfway.Then the political part. Unnecessary in my opinion in a movie like this.I do like the fact that ""good guys win and bad guys loose"". It was a good movie anyway, but not really a masterpiece."
532,"The concept is a remake of the 1985 movie ""Clue"", sans the multitude of endings. A good attempt, but it was far more entertaining the first time."
533,"Multi millionaire master of mystery thrillers Plummer has killed himself, or has he. Super sleuth Craig is hired by someone to look into the case.Witty and tricky whodunnit - a perfect homage to Agatha Christie with wonderful characters portrayed very well by a stellar cast / not a single bum note performance. A real pleasure to enjoy a rarely seen genre these days, so lovingly pulled together by Johnson."
534,Was very disappointed it was boring and drawn out.
535,It's got a great story and mystery to and The Who done aspect and it's got lots of great twist and the last 20 minutes is the most entertaining and I really liked the performances by Chris evens and Daniel Craig and.
536,"I bought the hype, really excited about the cast and trailers enticed me to talk my girl into going on a date night for what should have been a great film. Both of us fell asleep it was so slow and dull. The payoff, unremarkable and disappointing."
537,"One of the sharpest, smartest & slickest whodunnit murder mysteries that embraces & subverts its genre in equal measure, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is an intelligently plotted & ingeniously directed crowdpleaser that delivers on all fronts, and is all the more bolstered by outstanding performances from its stellar ensemble.By taking the existing template & turning it on itself, Johnson provides his own spin on whodunnit tales and weaves the plot so cleverly that it's always one step ahead of the audience. The story is gripping from the get go, the set up is quick, character introductions are swift, and the juxtaposition of lies & truth offers us a better insight into each character's persona.Johnson's suave direction & sly script further benefits from razor-sharp editing that expertly juggles & interweaves multiple viewpoints into one tightly-knitted structure which is then paced to perfection & never for once loses its momentum. The entire ensemble renders their rich, flavourful characters with finesse. Daniel Craig & Ana de Armas impress the most, with latter's role being the heart & soul of this story.On an overall scale, Knives Out presents writer-director Rian Johnson at the top of his game, and is his finest film to date. An endlessly enjoyable & wildly entertaining cinematic ride that's accomplished in nearly all aspects and features a brilliant cast that nails the brief with effortless ease, Johnson's modern take on the whodunnit is one of the best films of 2019, and certainly amongst the most entertaining. Strongly recommended."
538,"As a fan of police romances and investigation I loved the movie. Of course it isn't perfect as there are some open strings in the investigation. But the clues and how the story is played out makes it an almost perfect ""who dunnit"" story which is a must see for people who like this genre. It is enjoyable and funny to watch. The cast is competent and the acting is great.One thing that I would like to highlight is the bad habit that the current blockbuster american movies have to include political discussion into the movie. It is completely irrelevant to the movie, it doesn't add to it at all. We already have such political discussions everyday during the week, we don't spend money to to see this kind of stuff in the big screen as well. Of course it doesn't not ruiin the experience of this movie, but they need to learn that this need to stop."
539,"When news broke that Renée Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones, I remember mutterings and complaints from British critics and audiences; couldn't an up and coming British actor have been given such the opportunity? What sort of mess would the American make of the accent? Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were cast opposite her and despite the complaints and suspicions, the film was a huge hit, spawned sequels and it now seems rather quaint to think about these complaints at all.This was in the back of mind approaching Knives Out. Director Rian Johnson directs a starry American cast (and Daniel Craig, sporting an occasionally inconsistent Southern accent) in a film he also wrote that was to be a homage to the British murder mystery in general and Agatha Christie in particular. I could imagine some of the genre most loyal fans getting uptight about an American take on British traditions, but I hadn' t heard many of these complaints - may be, Brexit and Trump notwithstanding - we're all a bit more internationally-minded now.In any case, it really doesn't matter. Knives Out is a blast. The plot is a finely constructed work of crystalline beauty; each performance from the stellar cast is given at least a few moments in the sun; the denouement has more than one 'aha!' moment as revelations fall into place; and there are more laugh out loud moments than in many comedies, all of which occur without taking the viewer out of the moment, undercutting the drama. To cap it all, the film also works - and is clearly intended to, especially in light of the ending - as a metaphor for how immigration and precisely the sort of nationalism which turned its nose up at the thought of an American Bridget Jones; but it's not a metaphor that dominates the film, nor is it an overtly political one.What it is, is a very, very entertaining film which has - if those who need to say yes to such things do so - the clear capacity to produce a sequel or three. It's one of those films likely to be enjoyed by people who don't go to the cinema, to be discussed over Christmas dinner (rather than the politics), to be curled up with in a couple of years in the week between Christmas and New Year."
540,If you can forgive daniel craigs appauling southern accent this is a funny watch which leaves you guessing which way it will turn next at each junction.
541,"My Review -Knives Out
My Rating 7:10I'm a little either side of appreciating this film it's very entertaining and well acted with a great cast including Daniel Craig who is very good as the Colonel Sanders Hercule Poirot also Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale the matriarch of a dysfunctional family of self centred opportunistic characters .They are joined by Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer,Chris Evans and Anna De Armas as the Carer to the elderly rich author Harlem Thromby.No spoilers here I'm still thinking about the outcome and a little confused but my fellow movie viewing partner says it's more a retro crime comedy so perhaps I'm looking for logic where I shouldn't be.The Director also wrote the screenplay Rian Johnson who also wrote and directed the 3 episodes of the Breaking Bad series and Star Wars V111 The Last Jedi .
So tons of talented people involved in this entertaining film but to me it was a little like watching a film of a good stage play at times and I thought trying to be a little too clever for its own good"
542,What an awesome movie! Me and my Mom really enjoyed this film. The entire cast was outstanding and Daniel Craig was just phenomenal. Really great way to end a perfect Thanksgiving day.
543,"I had a fun time unravelling the mystery of Knives out, it takes so many twists and turns and executes the whole whodunit formula really well. The cast is fantastic every character in the film have very distinct personality traits that stick out and they are all played really well, Ana De Armas does a great job of being a protagonist that balances out all the exotic personalities these characters have. If one person stuck out the most in the film it was definitely Daniel Craig, the accent he puts on is fantastic while not exactly an accurate southern accent it is used in a way where its supposed to be exaggerated adding to the fun nature of the film. The writing is pretty great with the twists and turns blindsiding you at times making it more and more intriguing as the mystery slowly unravels.While I say the writing for the most part is great it has certain moments and sequences in the film that go for too long which can sometimes make you slightly bored and draw your attention away from the movie, it is quick however to getting you back to being engrossed in the mystery, if these sequences were slightly shorter and more concise it would benefit the film to me.While not perfect Knives out is a movie I had fun with and would be a whodunit I would recommend you watch especially if you're a fan of the genre or of the films fantastic cast members, 2019 is an excellent year for film and this just adds to that list."
544,"If I had three thumbs I'd still manage a way to give this film four thumbs up! It's a masterpiece of a movie. The plot flows perfectly and the suspense keeps you guessing. All characters played their part and Daniel Craig, no doubt knocked the ball out of the park. You fall right into his character as soon as he opens his mouth...watch the movie and you'll know what I mean. Movie of the year for sure. Mystery, suspense, humor and a thrill. It's definitely a must watch."
545,"Absolutely fantastic and good acting by all the actor, amazing acting by craig, very entertaining and great movie concepts, crazy story and outstanding in every scenes."
546,"A charming, cozy, and unusually smart murder mystery with a dream cast of heavy hitters. This is the kind of movie that never gets made anymore and it's a damn shame.It's a movie about adults for adults with a great amount of genuine wit."
547,"A movie written in the vein of an Agatha Christie novel that never quite manages to fill those big shoes. Benoit Blanc may fancy himself the next great detective of the murder mystery genre, but sadly he's more Arthur Hastings than Hercule Poirot.The solution to this mystery consists of twists you can both see coming and be surprised by, but my main issue with this movie is that not all characters are given equal focus and importance. The movie stars out by establishing that almost everyone had a motive for wanting Harlan dead and benefiting from his death, but somewhere along the way it drops this 'everyone is a suspect' mentality, to the slight detriment of the plot."
548,"I'm not a regular at the cinema any more - at one point I'd go weekly, whereas now it is probably once a year at most; last year it was 'Knives Out' that got me there, and I was glad to have watched it in that setting because at home distracted by tasks, requests, and children, probably the film would not have worked quite as well as it did. In the cinema though, with nothing to be a barrier to the film, it was easy to get into its tone and very much go with it. The reward is an enjoyable and satisfying mystery. I do like these type of films, but too often I find myself either many steps behind the detectives, or just having to accept their sudden reveals because I can't keep up enough to understand where all the twists came from. With this film though the mystery is welcoming and engaging, bringing you inside it from the start, and having twists that surprise and reveal, but yet make sense within the context of the film.Within this there is plenty to like. There is a playfulness to the delivery that is regularly funny and enjoyable. It also gives space for a nice slice of ham here and there from the cast. The social commentary is there too, in the way it handles immigrants, or the way the rich try to convince the poor that the former only have the latter's interests in mind. All of these things add to the film, but importantly they do not detract in any way - ie it is never silly, clumsy, or 'woke' but rather the mystery remains the focus throughout. The very talented cast make the most of the material, and the whole production looks great and has very stylish framing and direction. The result is a very entertaining murder mystery that delivers within that genre, while also having plenty more to recommend it for."
549,"If only it didn't contain Craig in the most overacted role and pathetic attempt at an American accent. Other than that, an interesting storyline"
550,"It was really great to see a lot of my favourite actors like Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans and Daniel Craig in a single film, that too a whodunit, one of my favourite genres. . .
The first 30 minutes or so felt a little generically convoluted but it got better after that and was entertaining to watch till the end. There was a lot of intriguing suspense and everyone did feel like a suspect, and I got a little ""Murder on the Orient Express"" vibe. It's not even close to that on the whole, but the few minutes of tension was perhaps the best part of the film. The next thing I appreciated about the film is that it kinda dodges the familiar route of telling the story. Things get revealed in the middle, and it takes a little different kind of route and becomes kinda ""chase"" movie. It's actually about what a particular character is going through, throughout the movie, and the hurdles that the said character is going through. Speaking of which, I need to say that characterization was really good in this film. No two characters could be exchanged with the other.What holds the movie back is that it doesn't use any new tricks to reveal things. You'll realize that everything that they went for were quite familiar and while serving the movie its purpose, it doesn't form a long lasting impression inside our head. And, the ""gimmick"" used for the protagonist is absolutely whacky.It's a very nice film and a really good way of presenting a whodunit, if you can ignore the familiar tropes. Chris Evans, fresh out of the Steve Rogers role, gives a remarkable performance in a role of a character that's literally the opposite of what Steve Rogers is. I just got to see that Evans was a much better actor than I took him for. Craig is fantastic, but feels quite like James Bond lite. Others have done a good job for whatever they were given. Rian Johnson is one of the most underappreciated writers/directors, along with Mike Flanagan.Score : 8.8/10Grade : A"
551,"Worth the way h if you like comedy, thriller and mystery"
552,"Don't usually get drawn to films like this ...- that said, I've even gotten into the remake of the Perry Mason tv show of late too ... so, my tastes ...they r a changing- ...and boy did I enjoy Knives out-standing IMHO. The cast are incredible to watch as each actor portrays their character so well.I'm not here to imbue others, as far as it goes, we all have different interests ... this is just my own perspective of watching something else outside of what I am usually drawn to watching and, though I'd heard it was a great film from other people, I like anyone else, prefer to make my own mind up. I have rated this film a 10 as I found the film had interesting storylines and the actors characters incredulity were convincing to the point I felt like I was there.Although ...I'm prone to admit that I'm extremely jealous of captain America actor Chris Evan who is not only, IMO, a handsome bloke who just gets better look as he ages - raggy sod - nonetheless, green eyed monster aside, he's incredibly talented in his profession and everything I've seen him in, purveys his onscreen looks and presence are just so natural. Daniel Crao was great to watch too, stepping comfortably away from his Bond character and, reminding us viewers of his acting ability before the days of 007. As always, Jamie Lee Curtis and Christopher Plummer need no acknowledgement as their acting professional ability speaks for itself. The rest of the cast are a great selection that also enticed me to give the film a whirl.So, if you like whodunnits your probably gonna love the film and if you don't, give it a gander.. it's a film for me that flew by time wise- which I didn't expect for a whodunnit as I tended to find the creators would drag em out. Thanks to everyone involved in bringing this film to life, it was, throughout, mesmerising."
553,"Really good murder mystery film which tried its best to bring something different to the genre. Good cast and a good film all round, little hard to take David Craig seriously but you an get past it."
554,"A homage to Agatha Christie apparently but it's badly written and the acting is in some places awful - Daniel Craig especially. They're making this so it can become a series of films...but I'm not sure it deserves a second one. Without giving anything away, it misses the mark by a mile and the plot was predictable, boring and full of cliches.I'm amazed by the score of this film...staggered in fact."
555,"With such an amazing cast I was expecting better things but sorry this is really not great at all and I'm surprised by the high rating... Incredibly weak storyline and things that do not make sense so it is hard to get into the film. Enjoyed the big, quirky mansion though and Chris Evans. Daniel Craig's character is pants!"
556,"KNIVES OUT is another comedy blockbuster based on the classic 'old dark house' style murder mystery plot that was once popular in the 1930s. The last time we had a wave of such movies was in the '80s, when the likes of CLUE was doing the rounds. This is a fairly amiable and enjoyable example of the genre, graced with a large ensemble cast each striving to out-perform one another, a fast pace and never a slow moment. Inevitably the plot itself feels quite artificial at times and stretches credulity on more than one occasion, but at least there are enough likeable or amusing characters and enough genuine surprises to keep you involved in what's going on. As for Daniel Craig, I have a suspicion that this is an easy kind of performance in a role that could be played by any actor, but he's funny enough in the part."
557,Thoroughly enjoyed watching this! What a stellar all-star cast! Well done all! 😄👏🏻
558,"I watched and read a lot of Sherlock Holmes, Poirot etc... I saw the twist coming at the beginning. So there went that aspect. Next was the lame attempt at subtle political commentary. That failed. Then you look at the director's previous work and the movie feels tired.
The reason I give this any stars is because the a tors were ok, the camera work was great, the set was awesome, and that's it. It's pretty but that's about it. Just like looper, it was more about style and ideas than actual plot. Both films felt forced and underwhelming. Don Johnson was decent, I didn't mind Daniel Craig's hammy performance, and Ana De Harmas was decent."
559,I can't believe Knives Out was such a big hit. It was so boring and just dragged on too long. There is not one likeable character in the entire movie. Daniel Craig has a laughable southern accent and Anna de Armas is pretty but she's a terrible actress. Meanwhile the very talented Jamie Lee Curtis seems wasted in a her small role. By the time they got to the big reveal at the end I didn't even care. Skip this movie.
560,"While the movie is entertaining, it places political themes over plot quality. While this isn't a negative in film per se, the plot is integrally important to whodunnits, which this purports to be. As a fan of mysteries and thrillers with twists, I found the resolution obvious before the halfway point, leaving me pretty disappointed.This is another entry in a string of recent political movies posing as a film of any given genre. Jordan Peele's ""Get Out"" and ""Us"" did it beautifully, Boots Riley's ""Sorry to Bother You"" did it shockingly badly, and Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"" falls somewhere in the middle. Lower your expectations if you're expecting a rollercoaster of a plotline and prepare to be preached to about hierarchies instead, for better or for worse."
561,"The house was funnier than the actors. We were expecting a really clever and comedic movie, given all the rave reviews. We were disappointed; it was not all that funny and the story line was average."
562,"The movie is a US remake of the classic British whodunnit, with a comical twist. However Craig's acting was cringingly awkward and distracting, with a poor attempt at a southern accent. That's not his fault, but the director's to not recognize this failure. Somehow they tried to emulate Poirot with a Southern accent. If done well, it could have been funny.At some point in the movie we got used to it and overall it was entertaining. But it could have been a great movie with some better choices."
563,"From seeing the trailer, I expected this to be at least an 8 star quality movie. The cast, the cast!! A few newcomers (that are becoming very popular) and a lot of big stars (Evans, Curtis, Plummer, Shannon, Craig). However,, the movie wasn't nearly as good as the trailer made it look. It's certainly not bad,, but an 8 star it is nowhere near. It actually takes a lil while to pickup and get going,,, so yeah, it's a 6 star. No more, no less,,,"
564,I love a good mystery and good acting. This film has neither. I imagine Daniel Craig had fun trying a southern accent and playing something different but it was distracting to the story. I didn't care enough about the movie to see all of it.
565,Incredibly average if not just boring movie. I found it very predictable and the acting was just extremely average and was weirdly underwhelming. I didn't have any high expectations for this movie yet it still managed to disappoint me. It just simply isn't worth your time.
566,Good story line. Was tough for me to get used to Daniel Craigs contrived horrible southern accent though. I'm not sure they should have made his character have that accent. Bothered me through the whole movie.
567,"I had to watch this twice to catch all of the clues, twists and red herrings. This was a great tribute to Agatha Christie. The cast was was a ""dream team"" and the writing was very tight. I haven't enjoyed a movie like this for many years."
568,"Great cast of actors who play in full strength. Decorations beyond perfect. The plot is a typical Agatha Christie mystery, which makes it quite predictable. It's done in a mocking post modern manner though, with a Colombo-style private detective, which makes it quite fun to watch. The ending is sort of weak, but that's only if you are watching it as a mystery movie. Also, the visual style is very much a TV movie, which doesn't make it greater.
So, on the social allegory side... The movie still lacks some depth. It gives a few powerful blows, one of which is the very ending scene. But the allegory is not perfect. How should I describe this aspect of the movie without spoilers? Let's say it is about the white guilt and oppressed minorities that are about to take the power. What will they do with their new power? Every character symbolizes a social group. One weak point is the minority is heavily underrepresented and only shown from one aspect. Shortly speaking, she's too good to be true.
I find this strange about this movie: it has a very high score, and the people seem to only praise its mystery side, which is actually a joke. And the social allegory side, which is the stronger side of the movie, is hardly even mentioned in the reviews. Though I still cannot give it a very high score."
569,"The plot is very fulfilling, reversing and full of coincidence. Starting with the death of a wealthy novelist, most of the characters come out and focus on a young nurse. In addition to the bizarre and ingenuity, the film also shows the audience two faces before and after the will. Marta's kindness and Lanson's heart are cruel, human nature promotes the plot, and it also brings a reversed ending. The music in the film is very memorable and impressive."
570,"Wealthy murder mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is dead from a presumed suicide. The investigating police is joined by dapper private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) who was hired by an unknown person. It's a family of annoying backbiting leeches and Harlan's kindly nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) who cannot lie without vomiting.Quite frankly, the movie is a fifty-fifty proposition for the first half. The family is so annoying and Daniel Craig is trying so hard to act. I really need him to stop his accent work. His character would be perfectly great with a British accent. It's all far too peculiar as Rian Johnson is doing his Brick work. The movie reveals the death early on and it seemed obviously from the very beginning that it boils down to the tox screen. She's on the hook as soon as that reveals her mistake. Non of it can cover that up. It becomes a lot of running around in circles.Then something happens that hooks me into the movie. I started rooting for her to escape Blanc's questioning. The vomiting starts as a silly gimmick at first but ends up helping build a good amount of tension. The last incident is obvious even before it starts but it's still fun. The tox screen is the flashing warning sign throughout the early parts even if it's never mentioned. I kept waiting. When it finally shows up as a major plot point, it seems problematic since there are bound to be copies. Chris Evans adds a great energy in the second half. Despite the nagging questions, it becomes a fun rollercoaster ride. It's a lot of ups and downs but it's never in doubt that it will roll safely to an exit. One thing that bugs me more than most. I don't know what Fran assumes about Ransom's scheme. She sees him tampering with the drugs but she steals the bag. What's the point of that? She steals a copy of the report but the original is bound to come out. What's the point of that? She blackmails him and meets him alone in an empty laundromat. What's the point of that? I don't think Fran's actions make any sense and is nothing more than a series of necessary moves for plot advancement which can all be excuse with Blanc saying that she doesn't even know what's happening. I have come to see Rian Johnson as a filmmaker with interesting style but sometimes his convoluted stories do not favor deeper examinations. Overall, I really got into this movie despite whatever nagging reservations I had about the plot."
571,Great actors with a funny plot! Entertaining! Worth to watch it
572,"Knives out seems like unflappable plot; a tested formula in creating a successful suspense film, but it never reaches the height of movies like Murder on the Orient Express. While the icing is still left towards the end, too much of the suspense was gradually peeled away, so did most of the glitter and interest along the way. This type of film, you either leave everything towards the end to be revealed and until then you keep leaving bread crumbs for audiences to pick up, which may take a long time, or you keep revealing plots until the finale, so Rian Johnson was left in a tough spot, and the end product is less than satisfying, not saying he made the wrong decision. A group of interesting characters were created, unfortunately Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas' characters were way too stereotypical and the least interesting of them all. The death of iconic mystery novelist like Harlan deserved a more suspenseful and creative story, but unfortunately in this case, it is less than satisfying."
573,"SYNOPSIS:
The famous Mystery novel write, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), has been murdered and Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) was anonymously hires to solve the murder and suspects one of the family. Or was it the nurse?REVIEW:
If you're looking for a film that the whole family can get into and have a fun time with, this is it. A ""who-done-it"" that doesn't take itself seriously. This film does, however, have a lot of social commentary where they clearly have characters that highlight a lot of those in modern society. Whether it's poking fun at SJWs or having a debate on the status of immigration in this country. I wouldn't say the film is for political people, but the characters will definitely make some laugh at how over-the-top they are. Daniel Craig is amazing at the stereotypical private investigator. Almost cartoonish in how he talks and almost film-noir esc. I also specifically loved Toni Colette's character and how very Valley-girl she is. All that aside, the absolute stand-out performance is Ana de Armas as the Nurse, Marta. I could've definitely seen her as a nomination at the oscars. She's the center-piece of the film or the ""donut hole that fills the hole of the donut"" in Blanc's terms. I felt everything she was going through and I was heavily rooting for her hoping she didn't make the ""nice"" choices. At times the film could be a little slow and it could've been cut down a little, but in the end I really enjoyed this film and I was a fan of the ending. 7.7/10."
574,"We fell asleep the first three times attempting to watch this film. On high recommendation from respected theater friends, we finally suffered past the first sleepy 45 minutes and spent the remainder of the movie flummoxed at what kind of viewer could ever swallow the premise of this murder and the holes in the plot too numerous and too much of a spoiler to mention. Set in modern time, the viewer must somehow forget the way any modern murder investigation is conducted through evidence forensics, DNA, personnel, and crime labs. Plot hole is stacked atop plot hole and preposterous coincidence that makes for an impossible suspension of disbelief. Apart from the inane writing for only the most gullible, not a single character had anything resembling likeability. We didn't really care about a single character, regardless of the star studded cast. I found myself waiting for some spectacular and grabbing dialogue or interaction, but only found disappointment, similar to a Fourth of July fireworks volley of duds that go straight to the ground without an Ooo! or an Aaah! By the time the predictable plot twisting and lengthy, rambling and unbelievable whodunit monologue of the lead ""investigator"" (a private detective somehow given sole authority!) arrived, we could have cared less about the plot, the characters, the victim, the family, the bumbling investigators, the good natured nurse, or even the overly pretentious artsy scenery or filming. The most interesting person in this charade was the mute Great Grandmother! Clearly this was 2 hours we should have continued napping through.
Conclusion: This should have been set as a period piece in the ""Downton Abbey"" times in order to make this 19th century investigating style believable. Or maybe written as a murder-mystery parody. This just didn't work."
575,"Daniel Craig was the best part of this film. It had a great cast, and an interesting storyline, but ultimately you tend to forget about it after watching it, compared to Gosford Park, which I've seen numerous times and loved."
576,"It's a really good crime thriller with a good screenplay, but some of the scenes were really confusing, probably editing could have been little better. Country side house, where this film was taken is a really good location with its surroundings adding value to it. Performances of Daniel Craig, Ana De Armas & Christopher Plummer are really great and they all score very easily with their expressions and dialogue delivery. Last 30 minutes were easily predictable and screenplay for which could have been better! Overall it's a good Saturday night movie!"
577,He should have given some property to his childerns. Some of them are not that bad.
578,This is indeed reminiscent of Agatha Christie mysteries. Not super high energy or dark. Some light drama. Some light humor. Plausible if unlikely intrigue.One thing though: 100mg morphine would take 10 seconds to start affecting ... pretty much any user. Likely the actual OD would take that long or less. There wouldn't be several minutes of coherent conversation.
579,"From the directors of Star Wars - The Last Jedi & Breaking Bad (Couple of Episodes) Rian Johnson has proved himself again with this masterpiece which we call Knives Out. Crisp direction is one of the USP of the movie as Mystery unfolds with past events embedded perfectly during the story telling. Ensemble cast supported the events well. Daniel Craig once again proved his versatility as Detective Benoit Blanc alongside with Chris Evans looking as Dashing as before and that too without his shield.
With 2 Hours of running time this movie has a lot to watch for, from direction, to acting to costumes & Sights etc."
580,"""Knives Out"" is a solid made mystery that not only churns out terrific performances, but also helps the viewer engage in the case as a whole as you will keep on guessing until the very end. The acting is incredible, while the production is top-notch. It's also refreshing to see a murder mystery actually set in the present day, considering the history of the genre. Actually, the film has it all - a great plot, great characters, great performances, good music, and great writing/directing. At the end, ""Knives Out"" doesn't reinvent the wheel, nor does it try, but it does what it aims to do incredibly well being fun and worth your time, this ""donut hole within a donut hole"" of a film. Enjoyable movie.Rating: 7+/8-"
581,"Knives Out is a completely enjoyable movie. That's it! I recommend watching it if it seems like something you might be into (well-acted mystery movies with well known stars). Why it feels like a slight to not bestow this film with an avalanche of additional praise, I'm not sure. There's an odd cult around Rian Johnson that feels manufactured. He's a really good filmmaker, both technically-speaking and at putting together a compelling story with his screenplays. He's no genius, however. This film is a super fun romp, but it's not nearly as clever as it thinks it is. Its twists aren't that twisty. Its Scooby Doo ending is highly Scooby Doo ish. I'm glad this film made a lot of money and has a lot of fans, because it is really good. That's it. That's the review."
582,"It belongs to the kind of good-looking movie, which is regarded as the best detective inference movie that Hollywood has seen in these two years. The whole reasoning and reversal design are very careful, and you really can't guess the truth until you reach the final step. There are several types of conversions in the middle, which are also very thoughtful. The performances are also very unique, yes."
583,"The characters are a bit quirky and quite interesting but they are cast aside to put the plot (the murder mystery) at the center. This would have worked if the plot was stronger, but it is predictable in some moments and Ana De Arma's character's ""ability"" to vomit every time she lies is a cheap way to drive the plot when it's stuck. Some scenes are really funny and overall it's an entertaining movie. Weak 7/10."
584,Daniel Craig struggles with that accent but I thoroughly enjoyed this cluedo style whodunnit
585,"A dialectic story bases on an investigation of a rich old man's suicide and his belowed, old timer Immigrant caretaker nurse having antinomy with the old man's family for the inheritence. In the middle of everyrhing the police, family inagreements, an odd private investigator makes the movie gripping.
Not a bad choice to spend entertaining two hours yet it has some humoristic, thrilling and action elements on its plot."
586,"I see negative reviews and stuff ,i just finished watching it and I'd say character development , direction , screenplay is good ,the plot pace is good too People expect every movie to be the best ever movie , it's a good watch"
587,"The scenario is pretty solid, a lovely way to unfold the story. A classic reminder to the murder-mistery movies from the 90'.Daniel Craig is great as a detective, a fresh sight from the Bond franchise.A must watch for certain."
588,"Never have I ever been so caught by surprise by a movie that I thought would be above average at best. I went into this movie thinking it was going to be a typical 'whodunit' Clue-styled movie, but there was so much more! All the ads I saw hinted at that. Almost a quarter way into the movie, it turned out to be anything but. Every time I thought I knew the direction this movie was going in, I ended up being wrong. That's at the epicenter of the movie: the surprises. They always have a good set up and the punchline is satisfying. The dialogue was a little cheesy but for the most part, it was well-written and the characters were all very interesting. I could've done without the politics in this movie, but I can forgive it because it at least had some clever commentary and there was the occasional political joke that landed. In addition, the cinematography is colorful and had some creative shots. I especially enjoyed the last frame, as if to destroy any uncertainty the viewers have about where everyone goes from here. The actors were also great in this movie, and how could it not be with an all-star cast? I will say, it was very interesting to see Daniel Craig pull off a Frank Underwood kind of accent. I almost half expected him to start talking to us about his deep and inner thoughts. But like I said before, this movie really made me reconsider the way movies advertise: because they didn't give away the big reveal(s), it made the movie all the more enjoyable. Far too often, I watch movie trailers that basically reveal the entire plot, including the twist. What's the fun in that? Knives Out was advertised in a way that not only the twists would be fresh, but that the comedy would be fresh because I got quite a few laughs out of this. Overall, I definitely recommend this movie for its sharp humor and cutting story (puns intended)."
589,"The movie starts of with scenes sort of like the Murder on the Orient Express. I already felt pessimistic with the movie by then but as you get through that, things get a lot better. Daniel Craig's accent is a bit off. So it gets me a little bit but his charisma and passion makes up for it. All the casts were brilliant and kudos to Rian Johnson for his subverting the expectation masterclass. This does not work with Star Wars tho. The movie is a thrill to watch and making like you are in that situation makes it even more exciting and fun. Making your own theories and decisions will certainly makes the movie more value as the writers of this movie really dug deep to get the audience to think and probably does not get the right answer.
Certainly will recommend people to watch. Thanks for the read."
590,"This movie was incredibly hyped and I was very exited to watch it, but honestly I didn't think the hype was fully justifiable. The movie was a great joyride and thoroughly entertaining all the way through. The cast was fantastic (as you'd expect it to be with such a star studded cast) and every actor fit their role and played it excellently. But for some reason, comparing it to the hype it received I just didn't feel like it was a ""masterpiece"" like I was led to initially believe. Overall I definitely recommend watching it - but don't expect it to be as great as the hype says it is."
591,"Marta Cabrera: I've never been to a will readingBenoit Blanc: Oh, well...you'd think it'd be like a game show, but think of a community theater production of a tax return."
592,"Kept me interested! Love who ""who dunnit""
movies. Enjoyed the characters, thought the actors were great!"
593,"The only other movie that I know of that was made by rain Johnson is, of course, the last Jedi. So I rightfully expected this movie to be annoying and brainless. But... it wasn't. So I have to ask why? Why rain Johnson? Why did you do that to Star Wars?"
594,"Very funny, And the plot twist is great, I also liked the pick of the gorgeous actor ""De Armas"""
595,"Knives Out deserves it's Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay. The story is well written, keeps your attention for the entire movie, and that is needed, your full attention, as there are a lot of twists and turns. Every time you think you figured it out there's another element popping up that makes you reconcider your guessing. It's like playing a game of Clue, but then just by watching a whole bunch of excellent actors. The cast is truly remarkable, with names as Toni Collette, Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer, Ana de Armas and others you can't really go wrong when the screenplay is that good. Knives Out is a long movie but it never gets boring, for that there is too much mystery and good acting."
596,"There is a very good reason why I mean ""backstabbers"" and not ""backstabber"" despite the fact that, for those who watched the movie, this whodunit resumes to one miscreant. It is because with ""Knives Out"", director/writer Rian Johnson created a cast of really unlikable characters--in a good way. If a noire is known for casting evil shadows over everyone, including men who are not inherently evil, then this movie, by definition, is not a noire--it is the opposite: everyone is evil and there are no shadows, but cheeky attitudes and bleakness.The title is adequate--after Harlan Thrombey, the patriarch of an eccentric, combative family and owner of a large publishing company dies in mysterious circumstances, very few of his family members mourn his passing. They are all metaphorically armed with knives, ready to stab each other in the back for the opportunity this arises. To legendary and aptly named private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) and to us, they all look capable of murder. His family is so well-written, and the movie introduces them all alongside with clear motives in such a way that by the end, whoever's done the deed is as good as anyone else. Not even the innocent caretaker of the family who has befriended Harlan more than anyone else, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) is completely eliminated from suspicion and this makes the movie work. For de Armas, this is the role to make her career. She proves through her performance she can handle the pressure of the leading act.""Knives Out"" is an entertaining movie to watch and it's all due to its characters more than anything else. Blanc is such a charismatic man! His flamboyance, his Dick Tracy style, this is essentially James Bond if he was born in Mississippi and done police work instead of secret service--he is the kind of guy in cartoons sniffing around with a magnifying glass (something he almost does at one point). Daniel Craig shows off some really comedic chops, all while Johnson is careful not to ridicule him and turning the character into a parody. He is nearly perfect. His Scooby-doo untangling of the case at the end is mesmerizing. And even if you might figure out some of what will unfold--as I did, it is impossible to come up with the entire package. Johnson really went over-the-top with this, almost to a point of paranoia, making sure everyone will be satisfied and surprised with the ending.Granted, ""Knives Out"" can be pretty cold. Its attitude resumes to legislative justice and it doesn't go in-too deep about morality or mourning except the usual ""be your own man"" and ""be kind and you will be rewarded"" novelties. It does go a bit into racism and migration. Marta, the South-American immigrant whose actual country each member of the family mixes up, is at one point drawn to a dispute about illegal immigrants. The hypocrisy of the Thrombeys is visible as they synthetically pat themselves on the back for the simple fact they accept an immigrant into their midst. It's an ignorant and intriguing form of racism which involves privileged ignoramuses being aware and proud of the fact they accept ""lower"" people.Through its circle of knives--both metaphorically and literally--Johnson does manage to find a soft spot of humanity in a scene involving Thrombey's elderly mother Wanetta--who says only about two sentences the entire movie and Blanc. He sympathizes with her struggles with old age and her mourning. Even if his poetic play-of-words is only done to withdraw information, the scene is great in the sense that it draws our attention towards a character who we might've taken as comic relief up until that point.This movie is for your mind more than for your soul. Even the epic, multi-leveled final shot evokes politics more than human understanding. But I won't argue. Both the former and the latter are necessary."
597,"Knives out had a good script and great cast. But actually, the movie didn't make me surprised and interesting. Howerver,storytelling and how to built a character situaition very very good."
598,"Good movie for a one time view, great twist but didn't like the way it unfolds. It doesn't really give you that trying to figure out who the bad guy is experience!"
599,"""Knives Out"" is a perfectly entertaining, perfectly agreeable little film, a star-studded old-style murder-mystery that's good fun while it lasts. The actors involved all seem to be having fun and the plot keeps you engaged, even right up to the reveal when you will, as can often happen with these things, find yourself saying, ""Oh, so that's...hang on, that doesn't make any sense"". For indeed, plot and motivation holes abound and ultimately you're left with a decent film (although some might find the lie/reflux plot point a trifle irritating). It's fun enough, the kind of film best watched after Christmas lunch with the family, but it's not a game-changer in any way.Mitchell Bulfin"
600,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Who dunning"" type of stories are not my favorite, but i couldn't resist from watching ""Knives Out"" (2019). A movie with such a stellar cast and raving reviews from critics as well as audience - i was intrigued. And after watching it i can say - this is a very well made movie with that stellar cast doing an excellent work - you can see and feel that they had a blast doing it. But its directing and script that made this movie work. The intriguing story kept me guessing as well.Overall, there are not many ""who dunnit"" type of movies today. And given the cast and writer / director behind it - ""Knives Out"" truly stands out as a very intriguing and very well made movie."
601,"It's a very entertaining film, definitely worth watching. The story is very interesting and the actors do a very good job. There is one weak link in the story though (spoiler: why would Fran send Ransom a blackmail note instead of giving it to the police).Of course I understand everybody is entitled to have an opinion, but when when you rate a movie a 1 or 2, and the average rating by thousands of people is an 8, maybe you should think whether your reviews are actually useful. I wonder whether some people actually vote against their real opinion just to try to do wrong by an actor or a director. Maybe you should try and find a different website and leave  for us ""ordinary people"". It would also save us a lot of time."
602,An entertaining film. Nothing outrightly bad about it but nothing to write home about either. It's a clever mystery movie with certain quirky aspects included to attempt to separate it from the rest of the genre.
603,"The plots were good and some how I got Agatha Christie vibes for this, although the quality plots the story could've been better constructed."
604,"Knives out is the kind of whodunnit film & very fashionable movie that will never fail to entertain. It's grand ensemble of familiar faces. Everything was beautifully done in this movie, the story, the flow & the scenario.The film filled with surprises with turns. Definitely best seeing without reading or looking up spoilers about it.Even though the movie ended up being with a predictable ending, knives out is a good film. Once watchable."
605,"Worked for me.
Classic type of mystery, who done it flicks in a tasteful way with very good actors.
If you like mysteries, this is a good watch."
606,"""The guy practically lives inside a Clue board.""2019 was truly the year of ""Gordon Lightfoot's 'Sundown' playing in movies"" and ""people singing Sondheim at random in movies.""Fun movie! Probably could have been truly brilliant if it didn't feel the constant need to superficially Address the Current Moment™ (look, this character is an Instagram influencer! And this one's an alt-right troll! This one likes Trump, even though we're not explicitly using his name! Isn't this politically salient and timely?!) Especially since that stuff never actually figures into the plot in any way and it amounts to just an onslaught of familiar sociocultural references we can all back-pat ourselves for recognizing. ""Clue for the modern era"" sounds great on paper, but I feel like it could've been done with a tad more panache than this.Still really good, though! Craig doing Rust Cohle-by-way-of-Foghorn Leghorn was easily the highlight for me-though Chris Evans has a few all-timer line deliveries and can rock a wool sweater like nobody's business. M. Emmet Walsh and Frank Oz get almost nothing to do but it was nice to see them show up anyway."
607,"Very good movie, unexpected plot. Film actors perform their roles neatly and give thumbs up to cast Martha.
Incredible movie.."
608,"Nothing spectacular. The acting is good, the story is ok. It's fine, not great. I'd rather watch Clue."
609,"But does not deliver exceptionally beyond that...The plot is good - there are plenty of twists and turns and it certainly keeps you engaged. It brings some innovation to it by revealing the ""perpetrator"" halfway through the movie. Although, it does resort to some cliches to advance the story.Visually it's also pretty compelling. There are plenty of nice transitions between scenes and nice shots which definitely, especially in-and-out of the mansion where the crime was committed.The acting and characters however, gave me mixed feelings.
There are 2 law officers, in addition to Poirot-esque main detective Benoit Blanc played by Daniel Craig (with a divisive Southern accent). They seem virtually useless to the plot. One seems to be included only for comic relief, but he is not funny at all, unfortunately.
The same goes for the family, aka the suspects. Several lack motive to do the killing, others are too much alike, and some don't play a role at all and therefore could be excluded. When you have such a A-type cast, that did come across to me as a waste.If you are after a classic crime mistery movie, Knives Out is a good choice.
With plenty of good actors and an engaging plot. Just don't expect it to be dazzled by it as movie-watching experience as a whole."
610,"Outside of Benoit Blanc having a foghorn leghorn accent instead of french, acting was very good and great cast. Honestly tho, rather a weak plot. Some humorous and cute moments but nothing amazing and the reveal was just...blah."
611,"It was unexpected in a good way. Love the twist. Acting is mostly superb, especially Ana de Armas, she's so natural and at the same time gripping. One thing that makes me wonder is why I failed to finish it on my first two tries, I fell asleep in the midst of first interviews (maybe i was too tired). Luckily, I pushed myself to follow until the end, and it was quite satisfying. Love it."
612,"Rian Johnson's tricksy return to form after his toe dipping into space opera from last year. Borrowing liberally from Agatha Christie, Johnson's investigation into the murder of a successful mystery writer is a crowd pleaser through & through w/enough jibes at the upper class, latent racists & the working stiffs which serve them. Running a little long for this kind of story but still adroitly hitting the right notes (or feints in this case) to keep the audience guessing until the final verbal reveal where either suspicions will be founded or thwarted. Ana de Armas plays the medical assistant caught in the maelstrom of murderous activity (I admit her large part was surprising & welcome) w/the bumbling cops & private investigator played by Lakeith Stansfield & Daniel Craig respectively, trying to catch up on the clues & red herrings laid out like sinister bread crumbs. The assembled cast is superb but special mention for me must go out to genre vet M. Emmet Walsh (still working in his 80's), Frank Oz as the writer's lawyer, K. Callan (she played Ma Kent on the Adventures of Lois & Clark back in 90's) & Marlene Forte who plays de Armas' mom who I worked w/back in the 90's on a couple of independent films in Hoboken."
613,"I didn't know what to expect as I'm not a fan of this type of movie. It is entertaining and it has twists and surprises. Sort of reminds me of how Christmas day turns out in real life. The timing of sequences is very good and a few of the actors are really enjoying themselves. They are very professional in their roles. One of them however comes across as artificial in their allotted role and this spoilt things for me. Frankly I was going to rate it much lower than 7 because it isn't my cup of tea and I was just interested to see it to fill some time ... but if you are a fan of this type of thing, I think you will probably really enjoy it."
614,"Not bad, but not great either. There were plenty of better whodunit movies better than this. The movie is quite long over 2 hours and I got bored and wanted it to end soon. The ending and the suspense was ok."
615,"Knives Out is a good ""who's the murderer"" and it's not the butler type of movie....
Daniel Craig's gives a sterling performance, but I did not care for his accent...
First 30 minutes are a bit weary, but the rest of the film makes up for it
Knives Out is closely akin to Agatha Christie's stories"
616,"Quick review of this film
The acting is terrific the always trying to work out who killed who is fine but it lets it self down in the second half of the film leaving the simple plot of who do it for w more long winded approach to the finale. All in all fun film great acting but just too long for a re watch."
617,"A retro murder mystery with all the tropes you would expect. All the characters felt deliberately antagonist to help the narrative. I found it enjoyable, if not a little predictable from my perspective. Am glad I didn't read the overly-glowing reviews about this, as my expectations would have been higher. It's a bit of light hearted fun."
618,"I was so excited to see this film-- sadly it fell a little flat. It's enjoyable to watch but never once did I feel the thrill of a good-ole-fashion detective story, which honestly was what I was looking forward to most, per the reviews I'd read.
Meh."
619,"Great film, really enjoyable start to finish. The acting is good or fine. The music is so nostalgic for me, it remind me of Clue.But still have problems like the kinda political conversation they having or the lack of sense of mystery because spoilers, I wish it was kinda hidden through out until the end. Still its good and entertaining for a ""who done it?"" Film"
620,"The story...good. The script...up and down. The direction...quite good. The casting...excellent, but somewhat wasted. Daniel Craig reminds us once again that he is much more than a James Bond, which he was able to elevate far beyond what the character that had been limited. He always seems to lift a production. Ana de Armas went yard with her portrayal. She keeps you guessing. Awesome. I wanted to see more of and from the ""supporting cast"". Check this movie out. It is very good and offering of things I don't always get. My loss, check it..."
621,"Definitely worth watching, production design and costiumography were exceptional. There were a few details I pat myself on the back for noticing.
Ana de Armas was really good. At first Daniel Craig's character was very in your face, but after a while he felt appropriate.
Some of the accents were not so great.
It was overdramatic but in a way that was not annoying.
I don't know how to feel about it yet, but everyone not on the main character's side was evil. In some places it was self aware, in some not so much.
The plot and archatypes were a little too predictable for my taste.
Overall, it was a very well made movie for a mainstream audience, which is why I appreciate it so much, especially since it is a comedy."
622,"Movies like this usually don't appeal to me(it's just not a favorite genre). I enjoyed this movie a lot. The star-studded cast carries the film for the most part. I do think that Daniel Craig is the MVP for this movie.I was surprised that you find out most of the actual story near the beginning of the movie. From there, it's reveal after reveal of what actually happened.Definitely give this movie a chance. It's not perfect but you should enjoy yourself."
623,"Good movie, loved it, easy to watch. You get into the movie pretty easy"
624,"I really like a good murder mystery and was looking forward to seeing this.Lordy lord was I disappointed.I mean it's fairly ok and has a few highlights, but it is very predictable and just feels incredibly bland.I don't get the comments saying ""so many twists, you never see them coming"". I predicted every so called twist and they were all clichéd.Overall it can be summed up in one word... meh."
625,"I was a bit alarmed by the backlash of Star Wars, in which a lot of people were talking bad about Rian Johnson. But this movie is in the genre Rian Johnson knows how to direct, in which Rian Johnson can deliver. It is a captivating movie, characters are well defined and balanced. A nice character study, a nice plot, a very well thought off twist at the end.
And yet, in stead of delivering a time less master piece about a family and how they deal with a time of crisis, the movie get lost in contemporary politics. Discussing current US politics, which makes the movie from time to time a movie for Americans in 2019 only. Although the movie can survive this and will remain a good movie to see, it will look dated in a few years, simply because of incorporating nowadays politics."
626,"Easily one of the most intriguing, mystery solver movies of all time. Just fantastically made with a nicely told storyline that keeps you on the edge on the seat, the climax is the one that you had expected throughout but not exactly in the way you did, it just makes you feel surprised.
The last one similar to this was a Tamil movie: Dhuruvangal 16"
627,"Rian Johnson proved once again that he is an above average director. He wrote a fun story with an interesting protagonist in Marta and a very Poirot-esque character in Benoit Blanc. They had a fun chemistry and created a fun story for the viewers.The reason I'm giving this 6/10 is because it didn't ever feel like a true ""whodunnit"". Without spoiling anything, I'll say that you never feel like you're trying to figure out who the culprit of the crime is. The ending was sloppy and rushed. It didn't contribute to the actual plot and it felt like an add-in.They advertised this film as a love song to Agatha Christie, but I disagree. With Christie, you were always guessing about who could have committed the murder, but with Knives Out, I never had that feeling. If it had been marketed differently (and therefore adjusted my expectations), I would have enjoyed it much more."
628,"Above average film whereby I enjoyed the fact that a film like this gets released in the first place. So your settling down in trepidation of what's to come and to work out all the computations of whodunnit, but unfortunately I was so disappointed as it could have been so much better. Sorry Daniel Craig fans but that accent was terrible. If that accent was so important to the character then I'm sure there are loads of actors out there that could have done a better job than Craig. The rest of cast were OK but nothing special. I've seen better whodunnits with just as good but less known actors with better plots on TV. It wasn't a waste of money that some reviews suggest. Was the plot obvious? well it wasn't to me but the so called ""twist"" wasn't anything special or a ""took my breath away in amazement moment "" I'm still glad I went to see it as it was entertaining for me and I go to the movies to be entertained."
629,"Great story. Good acting. Keeps you guessing until the end. Irritating southern accent attempt from Daniel Craig. He's a great actor, but from a southerner linguist point of view, he should stick to his British accent. Also began to get a little political with immigration policies becoming an issue in the movie. I'm not a fan of Hollywood pushing political agendas on either side. All this being said, we really enjoyed the movie and happily recommend it."
630,"Spoofs of Agatha Christie type stories (family gathers, DAD dies, everyone has a motive, will is read ,family reacts and eccentric detective showing up , asks questions and gathers everyone in a room and seemingly ad-libs a solution ) are almost as common as the real things. (Murder by death ...and so on..) Craig's overacting and tiring accent doesn't help ...but the twist is good. Actors having fun because they do get to be bad actors on purpose , it's a comedy ( like a theatre production ) of silly rich people being mean, acting nice poorly,
slamming doors and winking at the audience through their exaggerated mannerisms .It's cute, it's funny, it ends. It was actually OK."
631,"From the poster of this film it sort of comes out that this is one of those overthetop type of murder mystery films that in a way remind me of Cleudo, though a part of me feels that Cleudo is a little more serious than this film. Serious it is not, but I didn't really find it all that funny either. However, from the title, you can probably work out what it is all about as well, namely a dysfunctional family fighting over who gets the patriarch's money.So, we have this author that has made lots, and lots of money from writing murder mysteries (and of course he writes murder mysteries - what other type of book would an author write when he is the focus of a murder mystery). It seems that he commited suicide, but this private detective is hired by an unknown person to sort of dig into what is going on a bit more.The film focuses around the nurse who became the patriarch's companion, and follows her through the mystery, and the reading of the will (which, of course, you are going to have as well), and the final solution. Personally, I don't want to give too much away because it does sort of spoil the mystery, and the plot certainly does twist and turn quite a lot during the film, which a well thought out murder mystery is supposed to do.Of course, everybody (or almost everybody) has a motive, though as was suggested, not enough to actually kill the old man. Yet you can sort of tell that this family is somewhat dysfunctional - money seems to always have that effect on people, especially if these people are all hoping to get a cut of pie once everything is said and done.Look, it is supposed to be a spoof, though it is a lot smarter than a lot of spoofs that have come out in the past, though it is a good thing that those really silly ones are no longer being made. Yet, I have to admit that I didn't necessarily find it all that funny, though a part of me feels that maybe it is just the eccentricities of the characters that is supposed to make this film interesting. In the end, it was fun, but not one that really grabbed me."
632,"I cant believe that people are drooling over this movie. Its good, very well presented but 8/10 Seriously ? I guess people watch too much junk these days to feel amazed at average stuff. Lets talk the technicals first. Brilliant photography. Even better editing. IF this movie stands out, it is because of its editing. Art direction impressive. Individual performances are as good as these actors are. Now the real stuff. Daniel Craig's attempt to imitate Alabama born french is brutal. Eww. Tries too hard. Ana de Armas has only one expression, that of being dumb. How did she bag this movie ? Chris Evans is not convincing in this role either. Now about the story, there is one, but there is no twist in the story. There is nothing that we havent seen before. How did RT gave it 97% ? Because all you need to do is talk political correctness. I kept expecting there would be a twist, near at the end, almost in the last scene. But no, there was only disappointment, no treat. Better watch oceans' 11,12,13 again."
633,"This was a letdown. It's at an 8.1 on this site now and I can't imagine how it got there.So many critics raved about this, one saying something like, ""So hilarious and smart it made my brain hurt."" Whoever that was is easily overwhelmed. It dragged in the beginning, it took a long time to go anywhere.The pacing was very slow on and off. The acting was generally mediocre. Christopher Plummer as Harlan Thrombey, a mystery author, was very good. Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private investigator, had an awful forced accent that never, ever ended. He was trying to channel Frank Underwood and missed. It should have been a great ensemble movie, sadly it was not. It fell flat.I love classic mysteries. An important part of a whodunnit is pacing. The actual killer wasn't a surprise, the full details of the manner of death were more boring than thrilling. This movie never got to classic mystery status. I don't think the movie knew if it wanted to be classic like Agatha Christie or quirky like Casino Royale.If I can think of anything good it is particular parts of the house and some statues that are related to Harlan Thrombey's mysteries. A piece of furniture and action scene at the end was very well done.I could have skipped this movie, but was drawn in by clever editing in the trailer and some over the top reviews that do not match what I saw."
634,"Writer/Director Rian Johnson is best known for his last 2017 effort, ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi,"" which did very well on both Metacritic (85%) and Rotten Tomatoes (91%). Less successful in my opinion was Johnson's 2012 Looper, which was quite successful at the box office but featured a rather convoluted sci-fi narrative that didn't work very well. Here with Knives Out, he's decided to channel Agatha Christie, in a contemporary murder mystery with an all-star cast.
Knives Out is virtually ""all plot"" with stock character types typical of the genre. Case in point is the main character, private detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig who sports a notable southern accent. Craig does well in the part but just about any other marquee star could have taken on the role and done an equally decent job as Craig.
As the story unfolds, Blanc is called into investigate the murder of famed mystery writer, Harlan Thrombey (winningly played by Christopher Plummer), following his 85th birthday party celebration at the Thrombey mansion.
The quirky family members all soon learn they've been cut out of Harlan's will. They include Harlan's daughter: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), a real estate mogul initially bankrolled by her father; her husband Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's son-in-law, who's having an affair which Harlan was about to expose, and Hugh Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), an arrogant, spoiled playboy who proves to be the principal antagonist.
Also in mix are: Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon), Harlan's youngest son who runs his publishing empire; Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette), Harlan's daughter-in-law, who was married to Harlan's deceased son Neil; and Meg Thrombey, Joni's daughter (Katherine Langford). There are other characters here, mostly too numerous to list.
The other principal character is Harlan's nurse and caretaker, Marta Cabrera (a very solid Ana de Armas) who is implicated in Harlan's murder after she accidentally gives him a fatal dose of morphine. Instead of rehashing the plot, suffice it to say Johnson wisely keeps us guessing for a while as to who is responsible for Harlan's death.
The actual circumstances of the murder are well thought out, as Marta actually gives him the correct dose of medication through instinct but then comes to believe otherwise after the murderer switches labels on the bottle. Later it's revealed through a toxicology report that Harlan did not receive a fatal overdose, but following Marta's unintentional but false confession to him that she mistakenly gave him the wrong dose, he promptly commits suicide by slashing his throat.
The rest of Knives Out involves only a modicum of suspense with Blanc following Marta around the mansion (upon his orders), as she continues to dispose of any clues that might implicate her.
The basic problem with the narrative once we break into the Second Act (SPOILERS AHEAD) is that the most unsavory character here turns out to be the prime suspect and ultimately the guilty party. Without revealing who that character is, I can only say that I was expecting a little bit more of a twist ending, given the already evident presence of such an unsavory antagonist.
The question remains, do we need another one of these updated Agatha Christie-like murder mysteries? I say, why not? This one, however, is rather standard but it does contain a few moments of suspense coupled with solid performances all-around, from an all-star cast."
635,"For all those who didn't like The Last Jedi (and still might be interested in seeing this), there is some good news and bad news. The bad news is that some of the elements people didn't like in TLJ are still present, the good news is that the worst of them are either toned down or are much better served in an original mystery than in an action adventure with an existing IP, such as the need to ""subvert expectations"" or to show off how Johnson's cleverness (the script is cutely clever cute, but not as brilliant as it thinks it is). The final twists seem a little over-written and not without plot-holes, but honestly that's fairly standard for the mystery genre.This might be better appreciated by those who can't get enough of these kinds of murder mysteries, although the film changes genres several times, and stops being a murder mystery for a long portion of the run-time. A key reveal is made so early on (end of the 1st Act?), that the mystery to me at that point was more ""Where is this movie going now?"" than any curiosity about what else was going to be revealed regarding the murder.Acting is pretty solid across the board , although the all-star cast is somewhat underutilized and disappears for long stretches of time. This very structure unfortunately strongly hints towards later developments, even if you can't predict the fine details.I didn't find the movie to be a laugh riot, with just a few jokes here and there that land (the rest of the theater was silent for most of the film as well), but there are fortunately no cringeworthy jokes a la TLJ's prank-calling or milking scenes.This might sound negative, but the film is entertaining. The payoff at the end is good, but your mileage may vary about whether it was worth the two hours of set-up."
636,"I generally don't like Rian's work that much, but this movie was decent. It was competently done, well acted, had decent humour and put a nice spin on the whodunnit genre. It's one of the few examples with his work where I can actually get behind some of the expectation subversions because they actually make sense and don't ruin the established tone (unlike The Last Jedi). In fact I had no idea where it was going after the first act because it took the mystery, told us what happened (which I won't spoil) and then turns into more of a general mystery of double crosses and character motives that culminate at the end nicely. Also it has Chris Evans telling people to eat s!%t, so what's there not to like about that?"
637,"Another unwatchable movie by Rian Johnson. Looper was boring, and TLJ sucked. He even directed the worst Breaking Bad episode of the series. This guy is way overrated."
638,"Too long, made for tv movie, mediocre acting, few good lines from Craig no other redeeming factors"
639,"I love it when a movie surprises me. That happened a lot here.Halfway through, my wife and I were like, ""OK, it's all solved, where's the 'mystery' part?!"" And then ... well, a very enjoyable second half.I love murder mysteries because they resolve every tiny last detail in ways that prevent OCD nerds like me from complaining about plot holes or lazy writers. I'm really glad I took the risk despite the 6ish rating here and went to see this movie last night!I'm strongly tempted to rate this movie a ""10"" to offset all the ""disappointed"" fanbois... alas, this movie is merely an ""8."" ;)"
640,"I loved this movie from start to finish! It is a clever little film that doesn't use gimmicks to get its point across & what's more, it is so clean that it can be enjoyed with the whole family! The mystery angle is all worked out quiet well. The vomiting response to lying is possibly the only weak link, but I guess when you go for a mystery & comedy movie you have to suspend your disbelief for a while. Fortunately, I found that in the case of this movie, it wasn't such a hardship.The cast are all fabulous. Kudos to Daniel Craig for playing the role of an annoying yet interesting sleuth. All through the movie, I oscillated between liking him to hating him for his pomposity! That's the beauty of this character; there are quite a few different shades; wisdom, stupidity, pomposity, insightfulness & decency."
641,"A very clever screenplay and some excellent performances from an all star cast make this a very enjoyable 2 hours plus. Daniel Craig is hilarious as the southern gentleman sleuth(!) and Ana de Armas is just perfect as the lovely nurse drawn into the farcical chain of events. This whole concept could so easily have been naff but the writing, performances and general sense of fun, together with clever twists and turns result in a bit of a triumph all round."
642,"A funny, witty, and clever just like the movie Clue. As far as Who Dunnit? movies go, it's pretty solid and deserves some credit for it's take on dark comedy and characters. A lot of people are gonna say it's a Clue ripoff, but you can blame the trailer for that. There are similarities, the house is a character unto itself, and it's filled with a bunch of wacky weirdos trying to solve a murder, but that's as far as it goes. It has great production design, a fantastic cast and a very funny script. I love a good dark comedy, like Clue, Death to Smoochy, or anything from the Coen Brothers. Daniel Craig has one of the best parts in the movie, but everyone steals the show in their own way. It's the kind of movie Rian Johnson should be directing, something original, quirky and fun to watch. A lot of old people in the theater, which was funny, because we all know they like Murder, She Wrote. You could almost guess what might be going on, but it still manages to be it's own thing. It's a fun watch, and it's good to see something like this still being made."
643,Was really good and truly a pleasurable surprise to watch. Happy to notice that once in a while they can still do a good old plot the Hitchcock and Christie's way. And with great cast to do it more justice. I recommend it in full. Here's to the next one!
644,"An excellent story worthy of placement by more classic Christie plots. Although towards the end several of the many twists can be guessed in the immediate build up, removing any potential gasps, the film flows intelligently and keeps you interested until the end. Plus, after the initial shock, you get used to Daniel Craig's accent."
645,"I cant say much about this movie cause i got spoiled first, thats why i watched it."
646,"""Knives Out"" reminded me of ""Gosford Park"", with its focus on an obnoxious rich family amid a murder. In both cases, there are things that we find out about the family. In this case, Rian Johnson's Oscar-nominated screenplay really lets the characters unleash their most wanton statements. Like the miniseries ""The Politician"", it shows what people end up doing when they have unlimited wealth.Definitely see it. You're in for some real surprises."
647,"Everyone has done a fabulous job, especially Chris Evans,"
648,"Initially I avoided this film because the trailer just didn't do anything for me, and Daniel's Craig Deep South accent generally puts me off any film it appears in. But I was convinced by positive reviews from friends, yep I'm looking at you Dave!Wealthy patriarch of the Thrombey family - Harlan (Christopher Plummer) commits suicide and his dysfunctional and money hungry family come a calling. The police have to make sure the cause of death was suicide and then things get a bit back stabby and mystery based. Well, you actually find out what happened to Harlan about halfway through the film but the rest is the real mystery part.If Carlsberg did film casts, then this would be right up there. I could go on and on about how great this cast is and it is, Christopher Plummer, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and Riki Lindhome are as always superb, I mean that is a dream team of actors and actresses right there. But I wanted to focus on just a couple of members of the cast. First up, Captain America himself Chris Evans, after the Avengers, this is his first big film outside of the universe, it is nice to see him playing a more complex and less heroic character and much as I loved him as Cap, I'm looking forward to seeing him spread his acting wings now. Then you have Daniel Craig and his accent and you know what I was able to ignore it and focus on a great performance, he plays a detective who at first seems a bit out of place but soon develops into
Columbo/Quincy/Poirot and Miss Marple all in one package. His revel at the end is in the best detective tradition. We also have Ana de Armas as Marta, Harlan's nurse and the true star of this star-studded film. A Cuban actress who though appearing in quite a few films, this is the first time she's really taken centre stage. She's great in this role as someone trying to do what's right in a really mucked up situation whilst being played by everyone around her. And finally, Katherine Langford as one of the younger Thrombey's and Marta's friend who is torn between friendship and family, a real case of nature vs nurture - she and miss de Armas should both be stars of the future.I went into this film with quite low expectations and was very happily surprised, there are a few twists and turns and to be fair they're quite easy to spot a mile off. If you don't know who the baddie of this film is straight away then you need to watch more films! But is well-written with some fantastic ideas and an interesting path to get to the conclusion. It is sharp and witty and Chris Evans single handily has revived the chunky knit wear industry. The cast is stellar and Rian Johnson holds it all together with superbly, not a surprise as he wrote it as well. Each cast member on the poster deserves 1 point, Mr Johnson 2(1 for writing and 1 for directing) and because I was wrong, Mr Craig's accent can get a point and finally Dave earns the film another point by convincing me to give it ago. So, 15/20 for a film I had no interest in. Nice one murderous type peeps! I'm off to buy a White Cable Knit Sweater."
649,"Really, who better than Rian Johnson to bring the whodunit into a divisive and diatribe-ridden 2019? His usual affection for his characters and irreverent humour are employed to great effect in a studied, snappy, and surprisingly warm genre yarn that grapples with entitlement and integrity in provocative, unexpected ways. Craig, De Armas, Jamie Lee and Plummer all play against type wonderfully. What a blast!"
650,Daniel Craig is a superb actor.Great mystery movie about crime.I'd like to see this one again.
651,"Excellent movie! Keeps you nicely tucked into the story from the first until the last minute. The plot, acting, production, everything is done extremely well and I'm happy I finally got to watch something this good in God knows how many years of mediocre movies."
652,"A mystery that stayed unpredictable and exciting, with lots of interesting characters all the way through!"
653,"The story and the performances are brilliant. If you closely hear to everything that they say, you may pick up the entire construct of the story. Barring Chris Evan's drag eyeshadow in the movie, its direction, its screenplay, the performances and everything else is dealt good. This is definitely a must watch."
654,Great film from the start. A classic murder mystery film with good twists. A film that holds your interest throughout.
655,"I really enjoyed this film. From the plot to the actors all the way to the camera work. I've watched this film at least 8 times and each time I watch it I see something new, notice something else. Every time it's a treat. The first time I saw it in theaters I was transported, I became a passenger along the journey. I forgot I was in a theater, completely forgot. If you like a good who-dun-it I highly recommend."
656,Not sure how this passed me by when it came out last year. Whodunnits not really my bag but my son was keen to watch it so we did. Clever plot with super performances from all involved.
657,The head of rich spoilt family is murdered and in Agatha Christie style 3 detectives try to work out who the murderer is in this despicable greedy family. The cast is stellar and I'm not sure whether the characters were supposed to be funny but they were. I'm not a big Daniel Craig fan but this added another string to his bow in what was an impressive and entertaining role. A nice Sunday afternoon film.
658,I love a good mystery and this original one from Rian Johnson does not disappoint. Excellent acting although lead actor Daniel Craig playing the detective tries hard but ultimately fails with a southern accent. The story is quite entertaining although the whodunnit was pretty obvious once a certain scene took place near the end.
659,A great murder mystery type of story with just the right amount of comedy!
660,8/10 Good. Detective movie inspired by Poirot. Very interesting.
661,"The story is simple. The owner of a huge fortune is death and someone kill him , or was responsible for his death and the movie and the point is to find out who was the person.
This picture is tricky because he doesn't hide the problem. Basically the nurse got the fortune and she thinks that she was responsible for the death of the inicial owner and in cause that happen all the fortune would be took from her.
In my opinion this movie is great because although it give us prove that the nurse did it the picture has the class to make us doubt all the time and throughout the movie we have the feeling that everyone can be the killer.
The development of the characters is very well done and I want to enfatise the Daniel Craig,Chris Evans and Christopher Plummer performances. Everyone else in the cast are very good too giving the exactly or even more the feeling that the movie desires.
It's an excellent movie that I would recommend to everyone.
One quickly fun fact, if the movie was made in my country it would have only five minutes because the nurses can't benefit from the patient testament."
662,Knives Out really captivates you in the way that it gives you a lot more information than you thought you would receive in the first act and makes your list of suspects go down. Until you realize certain aspects of the murder makes no sense without filling in the donut hole and the hole in the donut hole. Overall Knives Out breaths some new unique life into the murder mystery genre with an all star cast that thoroughly entertains. My only flaw is that it was glaringly obvious who they would twist the mystery into being the bad guy. It did literally live up to its name if you saw the climactic scene you know what I'm talking about.
663,"The ending with the coffee cup is so subtle and beautiful that the viewer already knows how the story went after the movie finished without it being ambiguous, but by still showing and not telling. Genius. This movie is all genius. I think my favourite movie ever. Wow. I'm in awe."
664,"Firstly, let me say that Daniel Craig's performance in this film was Oscar worthy. His timing, his characterisation and his accent were brilliant. On top of that the rest of the cast were also amazing, and keep you engaged throughout. The film does feel very Agatha Christie, and I was hoping for a little more 'who done it?' and more mystery, though the film does well to tell you what happens midway through yet still add a cheeky twist at the end. Overall, Knives Out is a good film that offers suspense and surprise, but just needed to be sharper."
665,"It was just eh. Honestly pretty slow moving, nothing exciting."
666,Entertaining and easy watching but relatively simple and perhaps overhyped. Casting Daniel Craig with an attempted American accent was a huge mistake IMHO.
667,"A whodunit, for sure. But within 20 minutes, you manage to figure out the entire thing which makes it a little annoying once you've spent two hours watching it just for it to come out in the end. It makes the entire thing seem pointless because it is so easily predictable, and takes FOREVER to get the answer out. I couldn't get attached to it and found myself doing other things, just to be like ""well, obviously"" in the end. Seemed like a fake clue, to me, and poorly put together."
668,Moves way too slowly. Connections hard to connect. Find something else to waste your time on.
669,"No butler in this whodunit. The grandfather, and head of the family, commits suicide and all hell breaks loose in the huge mansion where all family members live. At the center of suspicion is house help Marta who was with grandfather that night, while the other family members were partying in the same building. Enter detective Daniel Craig ( Our James Bond minus M, Q, Moneypenny and Aston Martin) to investigate the suicide/ murder. Some excitement takes place as the investigation progresses . A few red herrings, some twists and turns and a couple of dead ends later the mystery is sorted out. A mediocre film which somehow manages to sustain audience interest . Direction and acting are average."
670,In my original review I forgot to mention that I fell asleep during part of it - it was way too long. Some of the charcaters seems irrelevant - why were they even there?Knives Out was way too LONG. My hubby even commented on the length and he LOVES this genre....Hubby and I loved Rian Johnson's Looper and Star Wars: The Last Jedi movies. But his Knives Out need more editing and fewer characters....
671,"My husband enjoyed Knives Out. Me, not so much...He loves English crime dramas. To me they just drag on and on and on. Too much talking and theorizing. I usually fall asleep. Or leave the room to work on my arts and crafts.Also, with the close-up of the medicine bottles in the beginning I knew someone had switched the morphine. At first I thought it was Harlan. The bottle switch was an obvious PLOT POINT. To it's credit, Knives Out has some humorous moments and the acting is good.Did all those old actors have on wrinkly makeup? If not, they need to start using facial moisturizer and SPF sunscreen. Toni Collette especially looked awful."
672,"KNIVES OUT starts as a murder whodunnit, but it quickly answers the question and leaves little reason to keep watching. We also fly off into first-hand accounts of what actually happened by peering into the minds of the suspects. If you're a movie-goer who enjoys watching oddball characters flail about in dry comedy, this is probably for you. For viewers looking for a story with plenty of mysterious or murdery goings-on, there's not much here. As other reviewers have mentioned, Daniel Craig's southern accent is a misplaced prop that gets in the way of the shots."
673,"When I first gave it a glimpse on steam,the big headline""complex twists let you get lost "" immediately fastend me .It is not usual for me to watch the sort of detecive movie like this one and I sit down preparng for a welcome to something exciting but I was frustrated.The plot is good but every twist happend just seems like the producer telling you ""oh buddy you must remember it because I am telling you it relates to something serious""See ,it is the key problem ."
674,"The writing and acting were excellent, particularly as regards Christopher Plummer. I stopped watching when he mentioned a relative of one character as being ""undocumented."" The dishonest terminology for illegal alien was disappointing. Otherwise, I appreciated the pacing."
675,"Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy writer, is turning 85. His eclectic and eccentric family has become fragmented, but Harlan believes he can reunite them at his birthday. After the entire family gathers at his mansion to celebrate him, he is found dead the very next morning. When the police begin to investigate his death along with private investigator Benoit Blanc, (Daniel Craig), many family secrets come to light. There are now multiple murder suspects, and they must figure who is responsible for Harlan's death.
Inspired by the plethora of Agatha Christie novels, writer and director Rian Johnson knows how to stage a murder mystery. Put an affluent old man at loggerheads with his family. Make each member intriguing, and give them reasonable cause - revenge, greed, spite, or all the above. Throw in a peculiar detective to solve the case, and watch the mayhem unfold.
But Johnson isn't content with the plot playing out in predictable ways. Instead, his characters are so mesmerising that you often get sidetracked, by design. After all, these aren't just big-name actors; they're all competent performers. Daniel Craig completely throws you off with a thick and heavy Southern accent that could quickly go over the top. But Craig knows how to reel it in, in a masterful performance. We're used to seeing Chris Evans play a heroic persona, but this time he's often despicable as Ransom Robinson. The underrated Toni Collette gives a unique take on Joni Thrombey, Harlan's daughter-in-law. The resurgence of Jamie Lee Curtis's career continues as Linda, Harlan's eldest daughter. However, 'Knives Out' is probably going to be the breakthrough film for Ana de Armas with her impressive performance.
As with most ensemble casts, some actors don't get as much screen time as they should, and the problem persists here. Nevertheless, it's safe to say they all do their roles ample justice. That's because the writing is outstanding, infused with a surprising amount of unexpected humour. While watching a murder mystery, everyone is trying to solve the case, but Rian Johnson will catch most of the audience off guard. He has created an extremely thrilling crime drama, that uses the collective skills of its excellent cast to great effect. 'Knives Out' makes a strong case as one of the best films of the year and a definitive murder mystery for the ages."
676,"After watching the trailer of the film, I think that this film should be able to enter my top ten of the year. Perhaps the expectations are too high. After watching it, I do not rate it high. Clockwork said that the director is also Agatha's iron fan, so my score is still low. Agatha is one of my favorite reasoning novelists, and one is a ghost horse star. In fact, the first half of the film was completely Agatha's tone, and I was very excited to watch it, as if the scene of the novel was reproduced, but then it became tasteful. I think a good reasoning movie should be logically impeccable or the plot is pushed very fast, so you do n't have to worry about its rationality. And the most important thing to reason about the movie is the ending. If the whole movie is OK, the ending is a bright spot, it will also improve the score a lot, just like ""Tuner"". This movie does not have these points.
If you shoot in Agatha 's style, one should be that the old man has a friend. In the letter to the friend, he mentioned that he suspected that someone wanted to murder him, so he wanted to test it. On his birthday, he put everyone Enraged because he is a writer of reasoning novels, leaving clues when he dies. Another thing is that all things are arranged by the old man, so that his children will be touched during this reasoning process and change them through death. In the movie watching, I always thought it was the latter, because the old man angered everyone in his birthday feast, and then explained to everyone that you will understand. According to the movie, it doesn't make sense. If the end of the movie is processed as everything planned by the female lead, it will add a lot of points."
677,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie , the script is good and the actors played well , very entertaining"
678,I really enjoyed watching this movie. Classic scenario with just enough humour to make it both interesting and funny. I'd definitely recommend it.
679,"With this ensemble, there could be more twists involving more characters, but it mainly focuses on Martha and Ramson, kind of a waste"
680,"This review contains spoilers.Knives Out is a mystery movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is directed, written, and produced by Rian Johnson. The movie stars Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. A wealthy crime novelist is found dead and the leading cause is suicide. A famous private detective by the name of Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, is invited to investigate the death.Knives Out is a great mystery that has many positive attributes. Knives Out's primary attribute is its snazzy writing. The writing is incredibly energetic and done well by Rian Johnson. The writing is the main draw to this story as the audience tries to piece together the mystery. Harlan Thrombey died after a family reunion which did not go perfectly. The story gradually uncovers facts such as the nurse Marta having accidentally killed Harlan. The movie unfolds these mysteries incredibly well and uses aspects such as Marta's inability to lie to great effect.
Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera is an excellent actress in the role. She portrays the nurse that needs to stay one step ahead of the investigation incredibly. I found that all the scenes with her portrayed the desperation, humor, and deviousness in a way that was refreshing to see. Marta Cabrera had a funny innocence to the character as the mystery unfolded and she discovered she was being used.The main highlight in the movie is Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc. The private detective has a southern drawl that is played to great effect by Daniel Craig. The movie uses this character effectively as Marta frequently tries to get ahead of the private investigator. I enjoyed all the scenes with Benoit Blanc and it is easy to get lost in the character's charm. Even when the character is acting lazily this is entertaining to watch.I would recommend 'Knives Out'.Grade: B"
681,This movie had a good amount of suspense & drama. It's not too serious & it's very entertaining.
682,"This is an easy movie to adore and watch over and over.,I loved it!"
683,"Harlan Thrombey, an elderly, wealthy, and highly successful mystery-novel author, suddenly appears dead in the bedroom of his mansion one morning after an apparent suicide. The authorities, however, are not convinced, believing that someone murdered him. They enter the wealthy estate to interrogate those who had been on the premises the night of his death: Thrombey's numerous survivors who had been leeching off his financial resources and are all at each other's throats over the inheritance. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), an accomplished, seasoned, highly-introspective detective, joins in and ultimately takes over the investigation, citing an anonymous hire. The key player in his search is the late Thrombey's personal nurse, Marta Cabrera, a young woman from Paraguay who cannot lie without subsequently vomiting.
This movie is a clever modern-day rendition on the classic murder-mystery genre. It has a compelling plot with many twists and turns. The aesthetics (scenery, music, etc.) are all very ""Clue-esque,"" bringing a sense of Victorianism to an otherwise modern-day setting. The acting is believable. The heavy use of characters' own individualized flashbacks to the night of Thrombey's death is tasteful and effective. The same ""scene"" is shown multiple times, but from different characters' perspectives and own personal recollections.
However, this movie also had its flaws. Some of the characters were outright annoying or inessential to the bigger picture. Some of the lines seemed as if they could have been taken straight out of a Hallmark movie, others were just in bad taste. I never felt a strong attachment (or strong dislike, for that matter) for any of the characters. In fact, there were too many characters, making it hard to develop emotions for any of them.
All in all, Knives Out was an entertaining yet easily-forgettable film, and the fact of it being a murder mystery makes me question whether or not it would be worth watching again. I would say it is worth watching, but I don think it lives up to all the hype."
684,"This is a typical failure of a weak and lazy screenwriting. What a waste of such a diverse ensemble of great actors!
Even though this movie was intended to be a parody of the sleuth genre, the plot could've been deeper and more thought off. Half of the family didn't have any reason to kill the patriarch, at least not a solid one.
The development of the story was lagging sufficiently and it was not leading to the final build up like in a classic whodunnit movie. Oh, and the dialogue wasn't on the expected level. Just flat, with no witty exchanges and no ingenious revelations on the behalf of the Daniel Craig's character. Man, I miss the good old movies with a spirit and soul! This one has none!"
685,"...for those who can't figure it out who done it. It is not so obvious but if you have a detective mind it is clear from the start who is the killer still you would have doubts about how - I knew and I had. So, fabulously plotted and well acted mystrey movie. Worth the watch."
686,6.5 /10Solid acting. Okay story. Quite enjoyable.I didn't enjoy the overall style of it. Over the top theatrical vibe was just not my cuppa. It feels more like a play than a film. Not a bad film but... just okay. That's it/
687,I was really disappointed by the story and most of all the acting of the main protagonist. I won't say who as to not spoil it. It's become quite obvious to me now that the director is clearly suffering from a prolonged hangover from his miserable failure with the Star Wars franchise. If you're on lockdown I guess it's not the worst thing to watch.
688,"""Knives Out"" is an entertaining film, a clear take-off on old-time Agatha Christie productions and such, except by three quarters the way through I had it figured out. This one has more than enough clues that if you're paying attention, you'll probably figure it out too if you grew up reading Agatha Christie. The only thing is that I think there's one last bit that isn't spelled out at the very end, but I don't want to spoil this enjoyable film. I'll let you decide for yourself if the mystery is ""fully solved"" at the very end. I don't have anything really negative to say about this film, other than that Craig seems so desperate from getting away from playing James Bond, that he went a bit too far in a campy, hammy direction that annoyed me a small amount (not anywhere near enough to wreck the film for me though). I'd encourage pretty much anyone to give this film a go, and considering the world we we're living in, I'd have to say it's pretty family-friendly on top of everything else too."
689,"I remember falling in love with Rian Johnson after he directed probably the greatest episode of all time (Ozymandias) and I was a defender of The Last Jedi so I'm just happy people are talking him seriously again. This movie was probably one of my favourite movies of 2019, which is saying something because I think 2019 was a great year for cinema.The standout in this movie was Daniel Craig in my opinion, at points, i forgot it was Daniel Craig and that's a huge compliment to his in depth transformation into Benoit Blanc. Ana De Armas was exceptional as well, probably her best performance. The whole cast worked well, thought Toni Collette was hilarious, Chris Evans can act! Lakeith Stanfield was great as usual, Chrisopher Plummer has still got it.The story was incredibly well written, Rian revealed things at his own pace, for the first 20 minutes or so, I was really trying to find out who done it?Overall, just a fun time, I loved watching it"
690,"I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and the cast really gave it their all. They really hammed it up loads. The plot itself was quite weak and it didn't really take much to figure out who the murderer was, definitely no Agatha Christie mystery going on. Even so it was still really enjoyable and am looking forward to the franchise continuing."
691,"First of all, great movie. However, after finishing it, I couldn't help but notice a bad taste in my mouth. I can't be reading too much into it because it holds its political message on its sleeve, or maybe it's way clever than this and is in fact sounding the alarm, because I hated that person taking over the house."
692,Went to the premiere and the movie is immense fun. It's a marvelous script and wonderful cast. Everything works beautifully and I would highly recommend it.
693,"""Knives Out"" Review
(9/10)KNIVES OUT LEADS VIEWERS ON A THRILLING AND WICKEDLY FUN RIDE AS THE ENTIRE ENSEMBLE OFFERS BREATHTAKING PERFORMANCES IN THIS WHODUNNIT MYSTERY.
Though Rian Johnson is now perhaps best known for having directed Star Wars: The Last Jedi, across all his films, Johnson incorporates story elements that subvert expectations, delivering twists viewers won't see coming. That's all to say, Knives Out fits perfectly within his wheelhouse as a modern murder mystery whodunnit thriller. Written, directed and produced by Johnson, the filmmaker also surrounds himself with an astonishingly talented ensemble cast, who execute his vision with masterful precision.
Johnson's particular talent of keeping audiences on their toes is on full display with Knives Out, which follows a fairly standard formula for murder mystery movies - in that the viewers are shown little bits about the night of the murder as the mystery is slowly unraveled on screen. The filmmaker uses a deft hand in both setting up and pulling off the twists in Knives Out, laying the foundation for them long before viewers even see them coming. Astute audiences, especially those that revel in solving a murder mystery plot before the characters on screen, will pick up on the clues, but Johnson uses their expectations against them to keep even those viewers guessing.
In a film with plenty of colorful characters, Craig's Blanc is an energetic scene-stealer, even as de Armas' Marta is presented more as the film's protagonist. The actress and her more understated performance work well to make Marta the most grounded character in Knives Out, contrasting well against the more campy, over-the-top members of the Thrombey family. Collette's Joni is another scene-stealer, dropping a surprising number of one-liners, as Curtis's Linda is a more imposing woman - though her performance is just as fun.
Every aspect of Knives Out - from Johnson's directing and Craig's southern drawl to the satisfyingly chilling score and intricately detailed set design - comes together to form this lush, captivating murder mystery. Knives Out manages to combine the campy fun of Clue with a new and carefully crafted mystery, plus infuse some commentary about everything from detective stories to modern American politics, all while allowing Johnson's filmmaking voice to shine through. In the end, Knives Out is a wickedly fun masterpiece."
694,"I have seen a variety of different reactions to the film, but I haven't seen one person point out the obvious. It's not taking itself seriously. I believe the film is a fun spoof of whodunnit movies. So convenient writing and dumb characters are kind of justified. It's not supposed to be taken seriously. Please just look at it differently and it will become so clear."
695,"It's definitely Not bad film but there was a lack of suspense and at times the film doesn't know if it wants to be a mystery or a comedy, it's a juggling act that at times drops the ball.
Still this is worth seeing, the performances are all great but I feel this could of been a lot better."
696,Figured it out in the first 30 minutes. Why would they use such amazing actors on such a waste of a movie. Usually love these kinds of movies! There was no need for the political immigration side plot. I am a huge fan of Chris Evans and he was totally wasted in this movie. Not sure why they gave Daniel Craig a southern accent. Can I have my 2 hours and $5.99 back???
697,"There are so many things to hate about this movie. First off, Daniel Craig's accent is so bad I couldn't watch more than 15 minutes after he started speaking.Beyond that, the acting is incredibly stiff and awkward, the dialogue is flat and dull, and the characters are unconvincing parodies of tired, overworn tropes. I don't think anyone could make a weaker, more uninspired movie if they tried."
698,"The writing is bad. The acting is uncomfortably unconvincing and self conscious.Apparently boomers love this movie because it reminds them of that old, horrible style of who-done-it where a clever investigator makes impossible connections without the film letting the audience in on any of the nuances of discovery.Novels like these were written as fast as people could type a hundred years ago because they were so simple, formula, and decidedly un-clever to generate.Now, if this style appeals to you, I would still issue a word of caution.This film clearly intended to assemble an ensemble cast that would bring life to its quirks and quips. The script seems to be intended to allow the cast to shine through what the author thought were interesting and audacious characters.However, both the writing and acting come off very flat and even painful. The film that the creators intended is obvious, and clearly present throughout as a sad, unimaginative passenger repeatedly embarrassed by trite dialog and the unrealized aspirations of a mediocre cast.This is a very bad film."
699,"It wasn't that good, not sure what film critics were actually watching."
700,"There are so many things I love about 'Knives Out', but possibly the one I love most is that it proves if your story is strong enough then you don't need gratuitous action sequences to pad the run time and keep the audience entertained. 'Knives Out' has one brief car chase that doesn't have a lot put into it (even the characters reference what a terrible car chase it is) and that's it. The rest of the movie is just the story unfolding. And yet it is so gripping that it is one of the best paced films of 2019.The cast in this movie is incredible. It is all-star and everyone in it plays their parts perfectly. I have to give special mention to Daniel Craig though. I haven't often liked Craig's performances outside of the 'Bond' series, but here he is truly fantastic. The accent he chose to go with took a little adjusting to, but by the end of the movie I couldn't imagine his character without it. He was a pleasure to watch on screen.This is one of the smartest movies I've ever seen. Every detail is laid out masterfully. It's a movie you could watch 100 times and you'd still be picking up on new things. Add to that the dialogue, the characters, the foreshadowing and the humour it manages to extract and you have yourself one incredibly fine film."
701,"But apparently if you are a red hat wearing deplorable, you'll be
miffed at the dialog that references that relate to you and yours. If you're an intelligent moviegoer, you'll enjoy the ride."
702,"Knives Out has a great cast, a nice story, a hand full of twists and is a game changer in the whodunnit genre.
It's not one of my favorite movies of all time but I enjoyed. The characters are almost all interesting and made me want to know more about them. However, I think if you're expecting a blockbuster with some action sequences it's better change your expectations because Knives Out is a little slow but stills really interesting. I would say this is a clever film for all audiences."
703,"I like that this is less about whodunnit and more about WHOdunnit.
It's a predictable movie, but it seems almost designed that way. There's a lot of little twists and turns the film takes like a letter having invisible ink proving an affair or a character trying hopelessly to destroy evidence. While these things may be predictable or even plot devicey, it oddly didnt bother me much. I think that's because the movie has such an infectious personality. It's shot super well, the music is wonderful, and the cast has so much charisma. But the crowning achievement is the characters and the snappy dialogue they are given. All the characters have distinct personalities and motivations. Watching the characters interact is easily the most entertaining part. I really watching this surface level family slowly turn on themselves revealing how horrible they really are. They are all nice, but not really. They are all self made, but not really. The only truly good person is our main character and it's satisfying to watch her traverse this families mine field. You may not like the slightly lofty approach it takes but it works way better here then in Star Wars."
704,"The preview had a modern Clue feel to it but it was not nearly as witty. Daniel Craig's bad southern accent was supposed to be funny..... I guess. The plot was supposed to have a twist.... I guess. Probably one of the most boring, predictable movies I've seen in a long time. Wait for it to come out on Hulu or Netflix."
705,"The movie was extremely exciting and kept the plot moving very well, and at good pace unlike some other movies. Unlike other mysteries, this movie was not centered around the detective, which was a very entertaining aspect to the movie. One of the only downers was Daniel Craig's attempt at a southern KFC accent."
706,"Very nice movie, good acting too.
Good plot, mostly unexpected and kept the audience on the edge throughout the movie. Did not experience any boring parts during the movie.
There was a small element of predictability at the very end, but it was not important.
Thoroughly enjoyed it.
I would gladly watch it one more time."
707,"I thought it was clever and well done with some good bits of black humor. Right up my alley. The acting was great and I really enjoyed it. Even knowing that pretty much anything was a potential clue, the scene at the end with the knife still surprised me.Random side note: Parts of the movie were filmed in the town where I work so it was fun spotting familiar streets and shops. And the bar where I have attended many trivia nights also made an appearance."
708,"With Ryan Johnson being the person that he is, meaning his Persona and how he acts on Twitter especially after the failure the launch of The Last Jedi oh, I wasn't really expecting much from the guy who wrote and directed The lacklustre Looper with Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, but honestly I was surprised.The writing for this film is spot-on, very Agatha Christie murder on the Orient Express styled writing, with Daniel Craig being Poriot, and we even get some hints at Murder She Wrote in the film. I can honestly say that for the majority of the movie the writing was fantastic, there were some places during the middle of the film that were kind of like waiting in really high water, but eventually you do get out and it ends up being a great and memorable movie.If Rian Johnson keeps up like this, I'll become a fan again. 7 out of 10 for the originality, but honestly the pacing of the writing of the film could have been a lot better.I don't understand how this guy can write like this, something intriguing, well written and well-thought-out and stand by this, but not admit that the casino bright scene in Star Wars Last Jedi as well as the character of Rose Tico were completely unnecessary, stupid and a bad writing choice and idea in the first place."
709,"Knives Out is entertaining, charming, and endearing. It keeps you guessing and every its plot is well-paced with twists: some you expect, some you don't. The ones you expect are more complex than they appear, and the ones you don't see are clever enough to keep you thinking.Craig is marvelous, and de Armas keeps her mystique from 2049. The ensemble has mesmerizing give and take which leaves for some genuinely inspiring scenes - if not for their content, but for their development.Its parts are great, and as a sum of its parts, it's magnificent. This well-timed, perfectly-lit film will have your face smiling, your mind racing, and the theater reeling."
710,"Miserable attempt at mystery, boring characters, a complete waste of time.
Bring back Poirot !!!"
711,"If you like to be bored and fall asleep easily then start watching ""Knives out"".I could stand 15 min before I realized that this would be a marathon hell Agatha Christie inspired movie. My daughter agreed and while we were still awake we walked out."
712,Excellent movie. Daniel Craig is priceless in his role. Just the right amount of comedy and a joy to watch! A truly Agatha Christie tribute. Go watch it!
713,"Everything about the movie was amazing, the plot, act, storyline, and twists.
The only thing I hated about the movie, and the reason why I gave it 9 instead of 10, is having Daniel Craig speaks texan accent instead of his mother accent. This was a really bad decision!"
714,"Movies like this help me restore hope in the modern cinematography. Rian Johnson found a really nice niche. There are not many movies of this type. Sure we had Murder on Orient Express not so long ago and as entertaining as it was it did not really offer anything new to me anyways. The staleness of the story we all read and saw so many times did not really keep me at the edge of my seat.
The same can not be said about Knives Out which is a very good take on murder mystery movies. It is full of interesting characters who are played by strong and well established Hollywood veterans. We have Christopher Plummer. Don Johnson. Jemmi Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette and of course Daniel Craig, ohhhh Daniel Craig who created an extraordinary character who I hope to see more of and with the huge sucess of Knives Out this might be quite possible. Other played their roles great too, Anna de Armas, Lakeith Stanefield and many others complemented the rest of the cast really well.
The setting of the movie transports you in time, it was a very clever choice of a place for an action to take place in. Creaky stairs, period Victorian house was a clever nod to the era in which brilliant Agatha Christie's books were written in. The movie takes inspirations from her novels and does a pretty good job at it. The house also acts as a great contrast between the worlds of poor and rich.
The dysfunctional rich family and aspiring middle class migrant worker are caught in the intrigue surrounding mysterious and sudden suicide of head of the family. Minute after minute you will get sucked in into this well realized world of mystery.
I really recommend this movie to everyone. This is a breath of fresh air and a wonderful break from all the superhero movies and also a proof that you do not need wonderful books or comics to create a wonderful movie. With the right people Hollywood is still capable of creating their own fantastic stories and fabulous characters. Thank you R Johnson."
715,"Despite the running time, the movie is amazing. It's a continuing challenge and you're part of the game. The plot is brilliant, the writing is super. Cast is phenomenal, especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans who work very good together on the screen. Rian Johnson does a tremendous operation: he take the genre of mystery novel, which is super classic and kinda old and turn it into something very fresh and prevailing. Highly recommend"
716,The rating is low.. due to it being very predictable and being overrated.. you can guess it within half and hour or within 45 minutes max.. and even if you didn't it gives you hints halfway.. and even if you didn't find it till the end.. (seriously) you're dumb.. You're actually dumb.. i can't express it even more explicitly.. the casting itself is obvious..It doesn't feel like a whodunnit.. really.. i didn't feel the twists.. i didn't get the ohhh factor.. if you can get me..A perfect popcorn or netflix entertainer for sure.. but.. not as a masterpiece.. not really a perfect whodunnit.. I'm just disappointed.. really.. i expected alot and i didn't get the end result.. maybe you should go into this movie with lowest expectations possible..
717,"Knives Out isn't a Who Dunnit. It's a How Dunnit. It's a disassembled, deconstructed murder mystery that makes a mockery of the entire genre. Whatever you think is going to happen here, doesn't. That's fascinating. Rian Johnson is a really talented guy. I feared that this film was going to suffer cliches and lulls throughout, but not for a second was I not invested. I loved the convoluted nature of the mystery. The cast themselves help bring it all together. The standout is Daniel Craig in the most gloriously fun role he's ever delivered. It's hammy, it's over-the-top, but that's the point. He plays an old-school southern detective with an unorthodox knack for cracking completely absurd murder mysteries. He puts Sherlock Holmes to shame. The rest of the cast fires on all cylinders. This is the rare instance of an ensemble cast in which everyone compliments each other beautifully. I believe we'd go from a really good film to a great one with a trim of unnecessary dialogue. A few key pages of this scrip hint at a larger political message that doesn't materialize into anything meaningful, nor was it necessary. Some characters are seen, but seldom used, like Lakeith Stanfield as the lieutenant detective. But overall, this movie is nothing but fun."
718,"Is an entertaining movie with classic all star crime mystery movie which I enjoyed, though You might be able to predict the killer at the first half, but still that doesn't take away the overall experience as there were lots of funny and interesting moments in the movie.There are areas as a viewer felt needed more tightening
CASTThe movie holds a strong team of respected actors, however there was little to no chemistry between them at times which weakened some scenes in the movie.Also some characters had been overplayed by the cast at times.Despite his good performance Daniel Craig had difficulty holding to the Southern accent of Detective Blanc as his British accent would surface at time.STORYLINEThe mystery and twists weren't so kept tight together, as they were sort of predictable. And certain scenes were slightly dragged that either gave some clues away or felt boring.OVERALL Knives Out is an enjoyable movie specially with family."
719,"I enjoyed this film from start to finish. It has enough twists and turns to make Agatha Christie proud. A family patriarch worth millions - ironically, from his outrageously successful mystery novels - dies in his huge country mansion following his eighty-fifth birthday party. Although it appears to be suicide, a world-famous detective who arrives on the scene isn't so sure.There are certainly plenty of suspects - his voraciously greedy family members have been sponging off him for years, and live in constant fear of being cut out of his will. Added to the mix is his young, sweet-natured nurse, who is the one person in the household he genuinely likes.What went down that night is revealed before the movie is halfway through - but is it the whole story? The detective (played with a Southern accent of indeterminate origin by Daniel Craig) and the nurse team up to unravel the old gentleman's death. But can either one of them trust the other?A sterling cast is in fine form - Jamie Lee Curtis as the victim's daughter swanning about the huge house, the incomparable Toni Colette as his widowed daughter-in-law and self-help guru, Don Johnson as the blustering son-in-law, Chris Evans playing against type as the smarmy grandson, and numerous others. Cast standouts are Craig and Ana de Armas, who shines in the part of Marta, the pretty nurse.There are humorous moments, but don't expect big laughs. Try to count the number of different South American nationalities ascribed to immigrant nurse Marta by this phony bunch as they keep insisting she's ""one of the family""....I'm not sure if they ever got the right one. There are a few pointed references to the social and political culture we live in as well.A very well-done movie, with the most natural-sounding dialogue I've heard in modern films - nearly all the characters talk like ""real"" people, with a singular lack of artifice. And I appreciated the fact that the gorgeous gothic mansion in its parklike setting is in itself one of the film's most outstanding characters. Its interiors must be seen to be believed.All in all,a highly enjoyable experience; I recommend it."
720,Good from start to finish. All laughs. Super smart. An homage to Christie that keeps you guessing and second guessing yourself to the bitter end. As a die hard Christie fan i got it from the start (insert slight brag)......but I was going back and forth throughout. Hard to make a nearly perfect mysteries but this one is bretty damn close
721,A great updated whodunnit with a contemporary cast. Super for a cold winter day
722,"If you don't like too much detectives, like I do, then you have to see this master peace for a change. If this would be tge normal standard of detectives, I would love it!Slowly the movie starts spinning up, soon enough you will be drawn into this movie, with great and humorous dialogues. And slowly the story unfolds. Very natural acting and great directors work. Actually the whole technical chain has been worked out with craftsmanship; the editing, lighting, the decoration, bits and props, camera work, the very accurate music that is there and isn't. This is synergy, beautifully made. I give it a 9!"
723,Great great I really enjoyed it please watch it I like this cast
724,"I have read majority of Agatha Christie novels, and Knives Out does a fantastic job paying homage to the Queen of Mystery. It's witty, surprising, and a great ride. I would recommend anyone that appreciates mysteries to go see this! Seeing it in theaters was also fun with a crowd laughing and gasping at the same time. We all clapped at the end of opening night!"
725,"An entertaining, clever, funny, picturesque and very heartfelt movie with fully satisfying ending."
726,"There's so many plot contrivances. Also, there's throw away lines to try to save horrific writing, and plug some of the most obvious plot contrivances. And don't forget, there's an ""intelligent"" inspector that doesn't even follow basic police procedures. Obviously, if this inspector was even remotely competent, the plot could never progress. The plot also relies on the inspector being oblivious to suspects committing a cover up right in front of him, and he lacks interest and curiosity in their suspicious actions. This isn't just an issue with the inspector, since every characters actions are ridiculous and only occur to push the plot forward. The film seems intelligent, until you realize every character is extremely stupid and/or lucky for the plot to work.There's so much wrong with Knives out:
-No medical professional would ever administer a dose of anything without reading the label first (lose nursing licence). Especially when three medications use the same bottle.
-Marta would have known within seconds that she didn't administer 100mg of morphine to Harlan. That's ten times the maximum dose, and effects are almost immediate.
-Morphine is a schedule 1 or 2 (depending on type and country) controlled substance, they would have secured Marta's medical bag, especially until the tox reports came back.
-The only evidence of a toxicology report is a piece of paper. It's obviously stored on a hard drive, often offsite, and should already be forwarded to the pathologist from the lab.
-Relevance of blood on shoe, without testing the blood. I've gotten blood on my shoes multiple times, it's always been my own.
-They don't dust the window sill or trellis for finger prints. Marta wasn't wearing gloves when she climbed through the window.
-They let Marta use the temperamental VCR machine with the familiarized security expert present. Resulting in destroyed evidence. They use a VCR for security in 2018, really.
-Benoit suspected Marta from the beginning, yet he lets her handle and destroy the VCR tape. He also lets her walk ahead and trample footprints and evidence outside too.
-""Hue did this"", really. A throw away line that the help uses the name Hue, but everyone else uses Ransom. They use a very different 'Hue did this"" in the cutaway during end scene.
-The inconsistency of Marta's tell. After the car chase (evading the law), Marta just casually spits in a cup. At Ransom reveal, she doesn't throw up for almost a minute and a half.
-Ransom's self incrimination to Fran incident. A man who's been this conniving would just ask to see his lawyer immediately without saying anything.Do you know how long the scene with Harlan and Marta goes on for from the time he's administered the morphine until he kills himself, over eight minutes. That's including cutting out the extra pauses in time as his dialog pauses for the narrative showing Marta performing certain actions in other scenes. Over eight minutes passes, and by ten minutes it's death from a opioid overdose, yet he shows no adverse effects or behaviour or cognitive changes in that time. Add in things like the prop knife (and another throw away line), dog bringing broken piece of trellis to Benoit, Marta pretending to be Harlan and Walt being outside smoking, etc. You have a film filled with plot contrivances. The absolute worst thing you can do in a whodunit film is have it riddled with plot contrivances.Anyone who thinks this film has a clever plot with intelligent writing needs to watch it again, and with a critical eye. The amount of plot contrivances would make any plot weak, but in a whodunit mystery, it's unforgivable. There's so many issues with this film, I could write a five thousand word essay on the topic. But, this film isn't worth the effort. Funny, considering the writer of this film put in just as much effort on the script as I did on this review. The only positive thing about this film is the hope that it's undeserving success and acclaim invigorates the genre. Hopefully, encouraging more competent people to make better mystery movies in the future."
727,Fascism is government overreach into all maters...this describes leftists...this movie characterized a young conservative family member as an alt right nazi
728,"This is the kind of movie that I wished Hollywood would start to put out, I love mystery movies, and the who-dun-it in this movie had all the things I like in my movies. Good characters, next to no CGI and great story drives the film. And a wonderful reveal of the crime in classic Hercules Poirot style for the ending of the film."
729,"Rian Johnson makes bad movies and this is another one of them. The plot makes no sense, the detective is annoying and of course the white American family is evil while the immigrant girl is the perfect person with no flaws at all. Thanks Rian Johnson this movie Confirms he can't direct at all. I gave it a 4 because it reminded me of some old hasbro board game I used to play."
730,I wish i could get my money and time back that i spent on this movie. I love mysteries and was so excited when this was advertised only to be disappointed. Nothing like Agatha Christie or any of the old murder mysteries. I have not went back to the Theater since and don't think i will risk losing my time or money again. The scenery is the only good thing about this movie.
731,Really a surprise and a lot of fun. Good acting by all. Daniel Craig plays a really good detective that seems really clueless? Loved it and we need more movies like this!
732,"Not everyone will love this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised at how hilarious it was. I was not expecting anything really that good, but it had me entertained all the way, and there were parts of it that adhered to classic moviemaking formula. It was a just slightly too silly at times, but it just worked for me. I think this is one I could watch again, but time will tell."
733,"Why is this film getting, great movie, Bravo, great who done it. WHAT? Are people not even looking at films anymore before they go and enter some idiotic review only because you either like the Star or the Director? This film is at best 6 star and I am giving it 5, why? Well just going to mention a name, Hercule Poirot. Those who actually are film loving people will know, the others will have to go and Google it. Oh! memorable mentions, Detective Virgil Tibbs, Harry Lime, John 'Scottie' Ferguson. I could go on and on."
734,"It is surprising to say this after the awful mess Rian Johnson made of the Star Wars franchise, but he actually has a lot of talent. This is a masterfully written screenplay and a well directed movie. This movie honours it's genre roots, whilst adding a few extra layers of narrative twist with a modern flavour.It was a shame that once again the director couldn't resist his urges to pepper the work with unnecessary anti-right wing agenda, which weakens the work considerably. Regardless of how you feel about Trump, the story would've worked better as a pure character story without the rich, white American bad guys v poor kind-hearted immigrant good guy slant."
735,"Unless I'm missing something extremely crucial, Rian Johnson is a director who seems to single-handedly confirm that modern critics like to play favorites. The same people who dismiss criticisms of The Last Jedi - at least ones that concern inconsistent rules, inconsistent tone, and inconsistent/unconvincing/lacking characterization - as superficial nitpicks that scoff at underlying themes and risk-taking, will gladly (and correctly) make those complaints about the final season of Game of Thrones. When Disney and Johnson mess up, it's fine.I'm not making any allegations against mainstream critics beyond that, nor shall I read their minds; people often accuse them of (1) being bought and paid for by certain studios, (2) licking the feet of ""Hollywood liberals"" until that does happen, or (3) having a political slant that favors certain filmmakers and messages. That last one may seem similar to the second one, but we forget ""bias"" refers to genuine opinion; not ass-kissery.As I said in ""The NPC Meme and the Irony of Who's Using It"", people like to make it easy for themselves by assuming no dissenting political opinions are genuine, but rather the result of Orwellian indoctrination and/or a desire to gain something from a left-wing establishment. Point is, it could very well be that critics sincerely adore Rian Johnson to a point of going unfairly easy on him.In the murder mystery Knives Out, he cartoonishly inserts his detractors (without even doing them the justice Lady in the Water did those of Shyamalan) and political enemies in a way that this year's Joker is often derided for doing, usually by critics I have observed loving this film (despite Todd Phillips not being this in-your-face and never asserting that evil is, say, a uniquely leftist thing). Again, the selectivity with which modern critics apply their lens really fascinates me, especially when they do it in a way where a movie that's ""more guilty"" of what they're decrying gets away. I'm not telling you which lens to use, mind you, or which standards you personally should want a good product to meet. I just hope all films are truly equal before your judgment.As I see it, Knives Out isn't horrible. Much of it, in fact, is quite good, particularly in the areas of cinematography and art direction. But praising stuff like this and concluding it's an over-all good movie is even more surface-level than that which Johnson's haters are accused of being shallow for doing, namely assessing the writing. To Rian's credit, my main gripes are with the ham-handed references, the occasional goofy-yet-self-serious line, and such subtle character names as Hugh Ransom (Chris Evans). For what it's worth, I nearly saw Black Christmas instead of Knives Out and this is Tarkovskian by comparison.Daniel Craig plays Detective Benoite Blanc, whose hilariously French name evokes Hercule Poirot, more so than his unconvincing Southern drawl. The rest of the cast, many of them prime suspects, consists of Jamie Lee Curtis, Ana de Armas (who, get this, vomits when she tells lies), Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, Don Johnson, Christopher Plummer, Lakeith Stanfield, and Katherine Langford of 13 Reasons Why.These actors, many of them legends, do well enough and work off of each other in entertaining ways (even when they aren't given the most dignified sentences to enunciate). As with the script, the characters show potential. It's a shame all the Star Wars drama compelled dear Rian to damage it by pretentiously owning his haters through the ""alt-right troll kid"" and whatnot.I guess this became more of an article about Rian Johnson and Film Twitter than it was strictly about Knives Out, but although I didn't really like it, both this film and The Last Jedi show that he can create a gorgeous movie that, at least in the case of the latter movie, has interesting themes to communicate. We're not doing him any favors by pretending this is the best he can ever do in terms of script effort."
736,"Well thought out, well put together, visually pleasing, and a thoroughly entertaining ride that keeps you guessing to the last. Whether you liked any of his previous work is irrelevant, consider the movie for what it is and it will surprise you."
737,"If I have one criticism to lob at the movie, it's that halfway through it changes from a passive viewing experience to an active one. What I mean is it transitions from a movie where you are watching the story unfold with the detective, trying to figure out who did the murder, to a movie where you are expected to root for the characters and their lives/outcomes. That's not to say this is necessarily a bad choice, it's a creative take on the traditional ""whodunit"" method, but it does create a bit of tonal dissonance, and I don't feel like the main character was established well enough to make it work all the way.That said, that's really my only criticism, and everything else is done incredibly well. The shot composition is gorgeous. The dialogue is witty and funny. The movie is quirky and fully embraces the absurdity of itself. The social commentary doesn't get overbearing. The acting's also fun. It doesn't expect you to take the cheesy, cringey bits seriously, which I highly appreciated. Some performances were over the top, but it's very clear you're laughing WITH the movie, not at it.The best part of this movie, I think, is (surprisingly) the amount of rewatch value it brings, which is uncommon for a ""who dun it"" story where you already know the ending. The comedy is very well-done and well-integrated into the story. There are a lot of subtle gags that are easy to miss in the first viewing, like when a shot suddenly cuts to a shaky cam following the main character around that seems incredibly out of place at first, but it actually turns out it was the kid livestreaming on Instagram a second later. Stuff like that is really subtle, shows the creative team put in the effort, and actually makes me want to pay to see the movie again."
738,"If you saw the marketing material for Knives Out, it pitches you on a classic whodunit. All of the characters have something to hide, things are often not as they appear and there's going to be a big twist at the end. Some of these elements are in Knives Out but this is a rare case in that it looks like a whodunit, sounds like a whodunit but is actually something else. They don't go the expected route and they reveal the nature of the crime much earlier than you would expect them to. It was a nice choice to subvert expectations, I was a little disappointed but they brought me around on it by the end. So adjust your line of thinking going into Knives Out, you might think you have it figured out but trust me when I say ""THE GAME'S AFOOT.""We also get a classic setup for the characters motivations, it was a nice blend of what you expect and something new. A fortune is at stake, everyone has something to gain from Harlan's death and when the shoe drops, no one is completely forthcoming. There's some depth given to all the players, I was surprised that Michael Shannon or Toni Collette weren't given more to go off of but we learn enough about them to understand why everyone is a suspect. I did get a little annoyed with how everyone was constantly lying or snickering when Blanc looked away, it shifted my thinking into suspecting many parties being involved when the reality was much more simple. There are so many red herrings that it was tiresome to keep up but I do think the ending delivered the desired payoff.The cast of this movie doesn't compare to the Avengers or you're average Marvel team up but you're going to recognize most of this cast and they've all given memorable performances in other films. I'd classify Daniel Craig as the lead and he's pitch perfect as Blanc. He gets the opportunity to be a little more laid back and comedic compared to James Bond and between this and Logan Lucky, he's got the range to pull this off. I really enjoyed the energy he brought to his character and I tip my hat to him for stretching a little in Knives Out. Ana de Armas gets the next most screen time and I thought she was good as well. She's dressed down and the role is much less glamorous than something like Blade Runner 2049 and she appropriately adapts. She's decent at being mousy and reserved and she added a lot to this movie. Chris Evans is in the cast, he's more sarcastic than when he's playing Cap but this was a nice return to a more Johnny Storm or Jensen character. But he also has to get serious and if you haven't seen his more dramatic work, he's more than capable of that and he delivers. Christopher Plummer was in the movie more than I thought he would be, he's a theatrical treasure, of course he was great. The rest of the supporting cast gets less to work with than you would think, they all get their moments but they're collectively good as opposed to 1 or 2 standout performances (all of them were good at giving the shifty-eye and twirling their respective moustaches).The best setting for a murder mystery is always a big mansion on a dark and stormy night. Knives Out has that classic kind of flavour, it isn't afraid to steer into tropes while avoiding others. I really liked the setting, it was fun and there's a lot of atmosphere despite the movie only featuring a few locations. The house becomes another character on the screen and this can be important in helping bring you into this world. The movie is shot well on top of this, the costuming and the set dressing is what you would picture in a game of Clue (it was referenced in the movie), it was only missing a ball and a character in a tuxedo. It's edited and scored to grow the tension and even though I would describe it as more workmanlike than fantastic, there were few missteps or problems which is a credit to the movie.I was pleasantly surprised by Knives Out. Despite the overwhelmingly positive critical response, I was happy to catch this when it was on streaming services. A friend of mine was eager to see it though and I'm glad he convinced me to go. I'm glad Rian Johnson got the opportunity to bounce back (I don't want to comment on the Last Jedi, my review is on the site and the screaming of opposing opinions on both sides about The Last Jedi robbed me of my enjoyment of Star Wars, thanks a lot for that everyone). I like a good murder mystery but I have a hard time reading the genre due the trope heavy kind of writing it requires. This carries over into movies but I have to admit when they're done right, they can be breathtaking (Gone Girl, A Simple Favour are both excellent movies that have come out recently). If I were looking for a comparison, it shares a lot in common with Murder on the Orient Express (the 2017 Kenneth Branagh directed movie) and I would pick Knives Out as the better effort. The cast looks like their having a blast, the characters are diverse and mysterious, the story is engaging and features enough curve balls to keep the reveal a mystery and the setting is a fun old school throwback that I enjoyed as well. Knives Out is a fun couple of hours at the theatre, its not a towering achievement in cinema or a masterpiece of screenwriting but its a well thrown change-up leading into the December ""award"" season. I'd rate Knives Out between a 8-9/10 but I'm going to round down until I see it a 2nd time, I don't know if it will hold up as well to repeat viewings. If you're interested, I'd recommend checking it out in theatres"
739,"Wow! Every single time I thought that the story had nothing left to offer and it seems like I got it all figured out, the plot would through a new curved ball again and again until it simply dumped the entire basket over my head in an exciting finale. The entite 2 hours I kept coming up with new theories and conspiracies as I was absorbed in the experience of mystery, humor and the performance of the actors. After that experience ended, I began to think about what I just watched and thats where everything changed.Knives Out is a whodunnit film so naturally, while I was driving home, I put on my detective hat and began inspecting the clues, details and plot elements. The film manages to skillfully distract the audience from its faults during crucial elements by turning up the comedy factor and speeding up the pace. As a result, you wont even notice the mistakes until the end when you are able to think clearly.What really takes away from all the suspense, mystery and the essence of the film is the political aspect of this film. Instead of being a gritty Agatha Christie styled investigation film, it feels like a Cinderella fairy tale with quirkycharacters. Sometimes, a movie needs to have only one theme. All that being said, I still recommend Knives Out as it is upbeat, funny and most importantly intriguing all the way until the credits. A good comedy to watch with friends or family."
740,"Super cool movie because:1. All the actors are really good in their roles, 2. has a nice Agatha Christie vibe, 3. they put in perspective the most relevant socio-political issues of today, like unfair treatment to immigrants and 4. director has the guts to think outside the box. Congrats to all of the members of cast and crew!"
741,"This movie is awesome. It is simply put, great and guarantees a great time with it.The story is so unpredictable. The twists and turns keep coming out and they don't stop. Even until the credits roll, the movie maintains its exhilarating plot with ease as it slides with just-the-perfect-pacing to the very end.The total plot, soundtrack, music, pacing and the setting were perfect and couldn't have been any better. It is simply one of the best crime and / or mystery thrillers I have ever seen.For anyone looking to have a good time and be blown away, this movie is a must watch. Highly recommended."
742,"Unlike usual murder mystery, the story was impossible to predict and the plot had so many layers that it was just 2 hours of pure brilliance. Would recommend"
743,"I've read a lot of Agatha Christie's novels and books. For me, she perfected the crime literature and made a great character of Poirot. She missed more than a couple of times and was definitely far from perfect. But SHE did her job and made it right. And Rian just tried to copy it, but with the lack of talent and, let's face it, writing capacity.The plot is not for once complex. It's overcomplicated and the characters are not interesting. Not a bit. They're one-dimensional and cliché and they reflect some of Rian's traumas. The kid that it's an internet alt right troll it's his way to show how ""dull"" and ""lame"" those people are, exhibiting his worst side as a sad person.The puke plot devide it's, besides disgusting, stupid. A person can't lie and when she does, she pukes? And she has no flaws? That's not character development, Rian, that's a Mary Sue, which you master in Last Jedi. And MOTHER OF GOD, every member of the family is a terrible human being, EXCEPT of course the sweet, kind and inmigrant, who is obviously ignored by the bigots.Sorry, Rian, but Agatha Christie wants her book back and mankind need to stop thinking yourself as an autheur."
744,"The film's story seemed interesting, but in my opinion this film is annoying, poorly staged and not convincingly played. While Daniel Craig plays himself again, Ana de Armas' character vomits when he lies. I cannot understand how big names like Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson are involved. However, as an actor you never know what the film will look like in the end. Even if the script initially seems interesting. Still, it was Christopher Plummer and Don Johnson who were the only ones that stood out. I didn't understand the role of the newcomer, Jaeden Martell, (which you know from the IT Remake) at all. He had almost no sentence and just stared at a cell phone the entire time. Very weak and unimaginative. Captain America, aka Chris Evans was ok. Nevertheless, the film manages to smile from time to time and feels a little entertained. However, I didn't feel captivated by the film. The Star Wars 8 director who wrote the film and was a director himself definitely needs practice. It wasn't a really bad movie, but definitely not a good one either. Very superficial."
745,"Rian Johnson has hit a grand slam home run with this film! The cast was terrific, everyone fit their parts perfectly. The movie kept you guessing as to the real outcome until the very end. Was Marta going to go to jail for a crime she thought she may have committed, and did she really do it? Or was she set up and if so, by whom? Who hired the P.I. Benoit anonymously, and why? Everyone has an apparent motive for a murder that was ruled a suicide, (or was it?) and the wrong people have apparent alibis. Pay close attention to everything Harlan says! Great revival of the whodunit!"
746,"The plot was well thought out and had many unexpected twists, the characters were interesting and all fun to watch, and the actors were amazing. I loved the aesthetic of the movie as well, especially the mansion in this movie."
747,"The family casting was well done for this title, and when they had screen time, it was well done. The viewer just doesn't get enough of the characters to attach or root for one over the other.
The production value is high, wonderfully done settings and atmosphere, however there was a lack of use for the exterior of the grounds to really set the mood.
This wasn't a comedy, or drama, or mystery, it was just a blandly told story. If you are in the mood for a romp of a good time reflective of the older styled who done it films, pass on this one.
In the end, this cast and story had so much potential to make a great little movie, it just missed the mark."
748,"As an Agatha Christie fan I have to say this movie was great!
I won't even talk about the cast, music and direction. The amazing and unpredictable plot alone was enough to make this movie a thrilling, intriguing and exciting experience.This is a masterpiece for all mystery fans out there. and as a matter of fact anyone else."
749,I really enjoyed this movie. So many laughing points and watching how all of these great actors inter act with each other. I felt like this movie was like playing the game clue. Mostly laughed at Daniel Craig's accent..fried chicken southern drawl...as Evens character says. It was done in Agatha Christie style which made this movie fun to watch. Great script and each character was written fantastically..Man I hated this family. Watch it if you really want to be entertained.
750,"I love this movie. The main protagonists and the antagonist are very amusing, and so are all the other characters. It was a a kind of a shocker for me when it turned out Ransom was the villain, because he seemed sort of nice to me until then. The acting was amazing, the storytelling was nice, and the dialogue was decent. I recommend this to anyone who's willing to give this a try."
751,"Knives Out is a 2019 American mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson and produced by Johnson and Ram Bergman. The film features an amazing cast- Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell, and Christopher Plummer.
The film plots around the death of Harlan Thrombey a famous crime novelist. He invites his family to his Massachusetts mansion for his 85th birthday. The next morning Harlan's, housekeeper Fran when came to his room for giving breakfast she found Harlan dead, with his throat cut. The police were sure it was suicide, but an anonymous person hires Benoit Blanc (played by Daniel Craig) to reinvestigate the case. From here starts the main story. Benoit after questioning the family members learn that Harlan's relation with his family was not so good: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard (played by Don Johnson) for cheating on his wife Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's(Toni Collette) allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt(Michael Shannon ) from his publishing company, and had a noisy argument with his grandson Ransom(played by Chris Evans)
the black sheep of the family.After the family members interrogation enters Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), Harlan's nurse. Marta had a problem that she couldn't lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. This is so because she knows she is directly related with Harlan's death. The truth was after the party, she, accidentally administered Harlan an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication, and then realized what she had done upon seeing the label on the medication vial. She was not able to find the antidote naloxone leaving Harlan minutes to live. In order to protect Marta, Harlan gave her instruction to create a false alibi so that she is not suspected for his death. At first Marta refuses to do so as she knew she would vomit for telling lies. So Harlan told her to tell the truth but in incomplete form. He then cut his own throat and Marta carried his instructions. Blanc asks her to assist in his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence of her guilt. Harlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta and his family members were astonished at this decision. He said in his will, ""I Harlan Thrombey being of good sound and mind leave my business, all assets and mansion to Marta Cabrera"". At first the family members started blaming the lawyer and they turn on to her, but Ransom helps her to escape. Ransom then takes her to restaurant where he persuades her to confess and offers to help her from being caught by the detective in exchange for his share of the inheritance. Marta then receives an anonymous blackmail letter of Harlan's toxicology report where it was written in bold ""I KNOW WHAT YOU DID"". She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but the building has been willfully destroyed by fire. Marta then receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the medical examiner's office, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief car chase, the police arrest Ransom. Marta then goes to the address as received in the email. Upon reaching there she discovered that Fran was unconscious and drugged at a high dosage. In her hand there was there was the missing medical report of her own. Marta at first hesitates thinking that Fran would expose Marta's crime, but finally calls 911 emergency and takes her to the hospital. Marta on her way to the hospital confesses to Blanc about her sin, but she was unaware that Ransom had already informed about her. At the house, Blanc finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's flower pot. Blanc reads it, and then interrupts Marta before she can confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death.Here comes a big twist in the story. Blanc now reveals the true incident: After Ransom had an argument with Harlan at the party and he learned that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta he became angry and left the party. But he didn't actually leave. He just went outside the house to make sure that in the security cameras it showed he left. He then returned through the back door and swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the slayer rule. However, Marta actually injected the correct medicine unknowingly without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to expose Marta as a murderer. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder. After that when the call from Fran's hospital came Marta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife, but it is a retractable false stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and arrest him. Marta asks Blanc when he realized she played a part in Harlan's death, and Blanc responds that he knew from the beginning, noting a small spot of blood on one of Marta's shoes. As the police takes Ransom into custody, Marta watches the Thrombey family depart from what is now her mansion.The plot of Knives Out is enjoyably, wickedly twisted. Even if the audience already guesses who has committed the crime, it won't be easy to figure out who actually has. The movie's pleasures lie in the way how these characters, each of them though well-defined always against one another even when they are pretending to be on the same side. The twist at the end of the plot is the main area of attraction for the audience. According to me it is a must watch film for all thriller movie lovers.This was the review of Knives Out,
by Pritam Bhattacharyya"
752,"Successful, extremely wealthy, crime-novelist Harlan Thrombey is found dead with his throat cut. The most likely cause is suicide but famed detective Benoit Blanc has been hired to investigate whether he was murdered or not. At least four of his relatives have a motive. Blanc finds an ally and useful source of information in Marta, Harlan Thrombey's nurse. However, Marta may know more than she is letting on.Excellent murder-drama, written and directed by Rian Johnson. Highly original and intelligent plot that starts like a Hercule Poirot mystery but pretty quickly follows its own unique track. Quite clever audience manipulation by Johnson: you think you have it all sussed out...but you don't. Wonderfully unpredictable and murky, while appearing transparent.All-star cast delivers in spades. Daniel Craig is great as Benoit Blanc, putting on a southern accent and pulling it off with aplomb. Supporting cast includes Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Christopher Plummer and none of them put a foot wrong. The stand-out, however, is by the least-known cast member: Ana De Armas as Marta. She probably has the most screen time in the movie and is superb in her role.A fantastic new slant on the murder-mystery drama, especially as the genre can be quite formulaic."
753,"Everything about this movie is fantastic. If you like quirky murder mysteries, this is a must-watch. It has more than enough twists and turns to keep you guessing. I thought I had part of it figured out thanks to ""Chekhov's Gun"" early in the movie, but I had it wrong and was pleasantly surprised.Rian Johnson did a wonderful job all around on this. Yes, The Last Jedi was a pile of trash. This is the exact opposite."
754,Knives Out is a really clever movie and you suspect everyone. Everyone gives a great performance and the screenplay is perfect. Cannot wait until the sequel
755,"This one really shakes it up, baby. More twists than a naked game of twister...which, of course, is strictly verboten while we all live the quarantined dream. So watch this masked & gloved instead. By far Rian Johnson's best work since that triple lindy of Breaking Bad episodes he directed. Looper was a turkey best forgotten. Daniel Craig is probably pound for pound the worst James Bond of all-time, but he's top notch as the Foghorn Leghorn meets Sherlock Holmes detective here. Worst affected southern accent since David Bowie's absurd appearance in Twin Peaks Fire Walk w/ Me though. This is why I didn't rate it a 10. Speaking of, Ana de Armas' performance is a pleasant surprise here as well. Best known as Ben Affleck's latest conquest (dude constantly out kicks his coverage somehow), she steals the show with an elegantly understated, immediately believable character and first rate acting. Not an easy thing to pull off considering the giant, trophy snatching cast. The lie detector thing, which I won't spoil, is a brilliant plot device, one of many slightly vulgar delights to be found in the dazzling guts of this immersive film. Those who have played Clue, may think they have an edge (the game is hilariously referenced at one point...very meta) -- and the trailer kind of misrepresented the film as just that -- but believe you me there is much more afoot in this near masterpiece."
756,"I can't rate this highly enough and keep telling everyone I know to go see it!
You won't be disappointed!"
757,"I had high hopes for this movie after watching the trailers. Great thing about it is it actually delivered! Everything about this movie was fantastic from the story to the actors and that satisfying ending! It wasn't all mystery though as there was plenty of comedy and some emotion to it, but it was all put together tactfully. Loved it!"
758,"Stellar cast, all of whom pull their weight in this ensemble whodunnit.
No spoilers here, suffice to say I thought the 'twist' clever & both the denouement & close are very satisfying.
There's talk of a sequel, even a franchise based around Daniel Craig's 'Benoit Blanc' character. If so, PLEASE work on his accent..."
759,"Yes, it's a good movie. The directing and the acting were all good. But the story somehow resonates with me, especially on the broken family relationships.It's not all the children's and grandchildren's fault that they're being spoiled and lazy and materialistic. It's mainly Harlan's own fault for being a really bad father and also bad grandfather. And in the end, he suddenly decided to not grant them any single bit of his gigantic wealth, effectively destroying their life and future. All of them. His own flesh and blood.Such a hateful person."
760,Finally a movie like they used to be. You go to watch it with anticipation of having a good time. You enjoy watching it while it keeps you fully immersed in its story and characters. You end up greatly satisfied with the time you have just spent and a little bit sad that it has finished.
761,"The story is processed extremely complicated to be confounding, yet is pretty predictable. The whole right/wrong medicine situation puzzled me too much and at the end, wasn't that convincing. It was very exciting when the characters were presented at the beginning but in my opinion, they all stayed a little superficial. Though there were pretty pleasing scenes in terms of directing and cinematography, especially the chaotic scenes. What i liked was the whole tragicomic way of narration. Overall, it hasn't satisfy my expectations. Could have been a way better movie."
762,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Don't usually go to the movies a lot but going for this one was so worth it. Great laughs, great suspense and great actors."
763,Typical crime film cinematography was brilliant. At end the plot what it matters!!!!
764,"I knew right from the start I was going to like this picture. It had a jaunty opening setting the tone, and as the characters were introduced, you knew you were going to be in for a compelling, old style murder mystery on a par with ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (both versions). I'm surprised this wasn't one of the candidates for Best Picture since there was room for one more in the Oscar line up, it seems like an oversight.The thing is though, you can't waver in your attention because you might miss something important, as there is a lot to take in with the multitude of Thrombey family members. My favorite here was probably Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) himself, even though he was the murder victim and not on screen very much. The only thing I couldn't fathom was Harlan slitting his own throat to protect Marta Cabrera from a murder charge. Can anyone picture themselves doing that? It made me shudder.Switching gears from his James Bond persona, Daniel Craig is quite entertaining as private investigator Benoit Blanc. I'm not too convinced that a real live Blanc would have been able to put all the pieces together to solve the mystery of Harlan Thrombey's death, but seeing it all play out on screen was a hoot and a half. With a great cast portraying hungry, would be inheritance seekers, the stage is set for a provocative and fun filled murder mystery. You really ought to check it out."
765,"The plot of the film is very compact and very attractive from the beginning.The love and trust between the heroine and grandpa is moving, which is in stark contrast to previous contention for family members. The scene that impressed me most was the heroine hold a coffee cup and looking at the family members on the balcony of the villa at the end of the movie. Although she had to find a way to fight it all, she was always a gentle girl."
766,"I enjoyed this film, though it was far from fabulous. Daniel Craig's drawl was distracting and unconvincing. The characters were despicable but aptly played, and the convolutions of plot were fun! But it isn't original. It is, however, a better telling of Agatha Christie's Crooked House than other attempts."
767,"Without giving anything away I'll be a bit vague.
We all know this plot script having seen/read many iterations before.
Positive: Credit for the little twists to the who dunnits.
Negatives: It just plodded along w/exaggerated, artificial & not believable character roles. Also, not believable that such a mentally healthy Go player would be in this scenario. And, not believable were the elaborate cover ups & the subsequent sleuthing. Finally, the irony of the ending was also far fetched & contrived. Acting - meh!"
768,"Watching a thriller was never this delightful without being nail-biting or too dependent on the stereotypically eerie background score to ""elevate"" suspense.Crime/suspense thrillers are known to throw in frivolous details and then sweeping out the viewer with the plot making them forget their hunches (if any) and then those same details come to play to help solve the mystery in the end or the help explain why they are there in the first place (Chekhov's gun technique)A good thriller has the most unexpected endings/ plot twists depsite tipping the viewers (sometimes misleading) to make them feel like they know what's been going on all along. Teasing them and catching them off-guard despite giving them the whole knowledge of the events. This movie did exactly that and more, taking the story to a whole another plane.
Having watched a good deal of suspense thrillers, I suspected that missing of Naloxene wasn't just a mistake and there was more it to it than just an honest mistake of Martha's and Ransom's involvement in Harlan's murder, with his name being the innuendo (this sounds absurd). But they deft-handedly weaved the whole chronicle giving the satisfaction of big reveal in the end. Had it been just an honest screw-up by Martha (which it most convincingly depicts itself as) and an awkward cover-up henceforth, would have made this one just another plain-vanilla prosaic picture. But the clandestine sketches and the generous offer of Harlan at the right time and strange idiosyncrasies like Martha's gag reflex to lying etc..make this movie more blithely amusing.P.S: My '9' is the standard '10' and my '8' is the standard '9'"
769,This is an awesome Agatha Christie styled whodunnit film. It has great character development and many plot twists. Can not recommend it enough if you are fan of mystery movies!
770,So glad I went to see this movie in the cinemas! Me and my partner loved this movie so much! It got me questioning and changing my answer on who had done it multiple times with many unexpected twists!
771,"There isn't a full moment, it kept my attention the whole time. Very good movie and unexpected."
772,"Meet the Thrombey's... Although pretty late to the party, I was just on time to catch this hilarious, who-done-it mystery movie before it slipped out of theaters and I was totally impressed. Having been exposed to various members of this ensemble cast at some point in their careers I was excited to see how they would be able to co-exist onscreen as an acting family unit.The accomplished and versatile ensemble cast is one of the many reasons to see this, with Toni Collette, who left so many speechless with her performance in Hereditary, or Katherine Langford who played the vitally important role of Leah in Love Simon, to veteran actors Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon, the film seems to have the right actors to carry the story along. Most people will have seen Daniel Craig act in his many roles as James Bond over the years, but they will be in for a pleasant surprise at his ability to play a quirky detective with a southern drawl and a penchant for finding the truth, no matter where it may lead him. Audiences will too have seen Chris Evans play Captain America in his many appearances in those movies of the Marvel Cinema Universe, but they will again be perturbed and flummoxed at the impressive quality with which Evans' is able to bring his character in Knives Out, Ransom, to life.Director Rian Johnson hosted a 23 minute video with Vanity Fair where he broke down a scene in the film, which is highly worth seeing (Before or after viewing, no spoilers!), in it he offers his insight into how the scene was setup from where the cameras were being pointed, to how it was working with all of the talent, to the behind the scenes ""movie magic"" that we don't get to see. It was fantastic to see how excited he was about explaining some of the minute details of what went into making Knives Out, which in turn allowed for more of his voice to come out and be evident when watching the film. He really is an exceptional director, who we should expect more big things from in the future.Ana de Armas, who plays Marta Cabrera, has to be mentioned here, not only because she's the leading actress of the movie, but because she steals the show despite being listed third on the movie's first billed cast list. Although, she occupies a substantial amount of screen time Armas uses many subtle acting skills to bring power and depth to her role, which is important to the development of the films story.Like the above poster shows, Knives Out is a robust, dynamic multi-genre movie that has something for everybody. I saw ""multi-genre"" because it's not just a drama, it has too many comedic elements to be pigeonholed into solely that category. Additionally, it's not exclusively a thriller or mystery movie, because at it's core it's truly a family ""dram-edy"" about a mysterious, thrilling event that happens to the family.. I won't confuse you anymore, but what I'm trying to say is that Knives Out is a great American movie with something for all audiences. See it when you have the chance."
773,"If Agatha Christie & Alfred Hitchcock had made a movie together, it would've been Knives Out. An absolute must see for anyone who likes any of those 2 masters, and still a super enjoyable movie for everyone else. Besides, it's not a remake, nor a franchise, nor a sequel, nor a prequel.... Enough reason nowadays to go see a movie!"
774,"(Contains minor unspecific spoilers) I didn't have high expectations walking into this movie. I was not a big fan of Rian Johnson's other movies, and the trailers only looked okay. I finally got out to the theater to see it about a week after its release. The first thirty minutes play out similarly to a normal murder mystery. The murder is found and all of the suspects are introduced. Then when a character that I will not say the name of here is interviewed by Blanc. The movie shifts genres; what was once a traditional whodunit is now a crime movie. What Johnson does so well is that he convinces you that you know who did it. The rest of the movie is great, and I love Blanc's reveal. Honestly a great movie with some very funny moments. 10/10"
775,"I've been binging best movies of 2019. Around this time every year I absorb all this incredible content. i.e. last night UNCUT GEMS, a total gem!!Rian Johnson has a very impressive track record for the movies hes written and directed. Take Brick and looper and vast directing valuable content, ala breaking bad. Even created the most underrated TV shows that I rank one of the most underrated shows Terierirs. This story, Daniel Criag Bravo, is a total masterpiece. No one has delievered a movie this absolutely brilliant in every single regard. You can find somehting in nearly every frame shot that spoke.This man is a legend and idc what others say because I have seen his great works and not so great, most of the time, the important time, of his career, his knocks it out of the ballpark!This is an absolutely amazing experience and I feel lucky that I've just watched it in what flew by"
776,"It Is Fantastic.Movie Has a great Atomosphire and Characters and You will dissolve like,suger in tea,in this movie.
Screenplay Is Written Every Carefully and Every Thing is in Own Place.Comedy is Used Very Carefully That Become An advantage for this movie.
Music Is Used Extremely Great.It Give harmony and Make a bridge between You and Movie.Colours Used in Envirment in movie,They Make a New genre ;) of Criminal Movies."
777,"Why Chris Evans??? you won't be doing that movie, average movie"
778,"Very promising start, new style, but a horrible ending!"
779,"Here we have a murder mystery done in the style of Agatha Christie. It is smartly written and was one of very very very few movies like this where I was kept guessing throughout. An accomplished author named Harlan Thrombey dies and the police rule it a suicide. Before they can close the case though a renowned private detective named Benoit Blanc shows up claiming he has been hired to find a murderer. The whole family is suspect and the home nurse that took care of Harla, Marta, is pulled in to help try and sort out who that might be.
This movie has such an amazing cast of some very accomplished and respected actors, there was no way in hell it would fail. I loved the many twists it took to reach the final unveiling of who killed Harlan. This movie should have been a 10, but I knocked off three stars for two reasons. The first and foremost is while Daniel Craig is a great actor, having him adopt an American accent was a poor choice. He neither does it well nor convincingly. Second there were some points where it felt like it dragged on just a bit. I think the editing team could have trimmed some fat. Other than that I could find no flaws in this film."
780,Not sure about this one. It had the premise but lacked something.Not sure what. Maybe seeing Daniel Craig do what he did.
781,"A rich elderly writer (Christopher Plummer) commits suicide and his combative family (including Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson and Chris Evans) line up to see who gets what. But was it really suicide...or murder? Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) starts investigating.Good mystery. It's full of twists and turns and has some funny moments. Also there's some stunning production design--LOVE the house Plummer lives in. There's also a large great cast giving good performances. No one is bad but Craig, Curtis and Evans are excellent. Still I didn't love it. It's a little too long and gets needlessly convoluted at the end. Also a lot of the humor fell flat and some of these characters are really vicious. Still it's worth seeing at least once for the cast alone."
782,"Rian Johnson pays tribute to the classic murder-mysteries of old ranging from Agatha Christie to Columbo. Since this movie is still newly arrived in theaters, I'll stave from spoiling the movie.I'll say this, the movie wraps a 7/10 mystery up with a 8/10 cast and 9/10 direction from Rian Johnson who keeps it all balanced out well and good. Daniel Craig is very good as the colorful detective Benoit Blanc and Ana De Armas is excellent as the de facto protagaonist out of an impressive ensemble. Shout out to Chris Evan who's clearly having fun with his part.The movie has a good sense of pacing to let the mystery unravel piece by piece. You think you know how the story will end but then it surprises you. Not a bad feat in this day and age."
783,Great film. The cast all had great chemistry. It has that modern mystery vibe and does a great job of keeping you guessing.
784,"So I finally got to the movie theater and saw Knives Out. With a huge all star cast. This movie is a whodunnit. The movie stars Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, & Christopher Plummer. The storyline is a famous Arthur supposedly committed suicide. But there is a fowl play. Who killed Harlem? Now this is a fun movie. Entertaining as hell. Daniel Craig is superb as the detective. The cast of characters are fun to watch. Especially Chris Evans, Don Johnson and Michael Shannon. The storyline is good, the whodunnit concept was good, but to me it was easy to pick who did it? Did you guess right? The directions by Rian Johnson was great. Loved the angles and shots he did. This is a fun movie ride. You will love all the characters and the ending to this whodunnit. My rating is 8/10. Thoughts? #knivesout #christopherplummer #danielcraig #chrisevans #donjohnson #jamieleecurtis #whodunit"
785,"Rian johnson really rehabilitated himself with this one, his star wars movie sucked big time but this movie here is really great and entertaining, great cast & acting and very well executed. an excellent movie in the tradition of old agatha christie movies. proof that great directors/writers need to pick there projects carefully to keep an spotless resume. i also enjoyed daniel craigs performance, this guy can act and doesnt allow himself to be pinned to any stereotypical roles."
786,"As a dark humour film, this is a really good film to have a laugh with your mate. However, personally I might not treat it as a thriller genre as it is not frightening and creepy enough. Cinematographers did a great job for composition and lighting. Overall, it is a film that won't disappoint you and worth to pay for the ticket"
787,"The whole movie was quite good, and the premise with its odd twists and turns kept you guessing. It dragged a bit in spots, probably because they spent too much time working a twist that would be a dead end.My biggest complaint, as with movies like this, are the maddening little things that they get inconsistent. As the goofs section noted, the geography was off, and timeline on the morphine injection that the housekeeper received didn't make sense with what had been discussed earlier between Christopher Plummer and his nurse. Come to think of it, the timeline they discussed didn't make sense when the nurse gave him an overdose. And what was with Daniel Craig's accent? It had its own set of twists and turns!Okay, I do recommend it as 2 hours of inspired silliness and guessing who dunnit. And if you aren't the type like me that get frustrated by inconsistencies that don't really affect the plot, you can add a star or a star and a half to my rating."
788,"Directed by Rian Johnson. Starring Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer, Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Noah Segan, Edi Patterson, Riki Lindhome, K Callan, Frank Oz. (PG-13)When the rich patriarch (Plummer) of a family of avaricious eccentrics dies (by suicide, it appears), private detective Craig--replete with a thick Southern drawl (""CSI: KFC,"" per Evans)--is on the case, trying to figure out what really happened and why. Entertaining mystery with a heavy dose of humor and social commentary keeps the twists coming at a fairly consistent clip throughout, modernizing the classic Agatha Christie-style potboiler without sacrificing the elegance and idiosyncrasies (wealth aside, this is not a family one would like to be a part of). Some of the surprises can be guessed pretty easily, others may prove challenging, but it's great fun no matter how good a sleuth the viewer is. Well-cast, with Craig, Collette, Curtis and de Armas being the standouts; because of the size of the ensemble, it's not always easy to keep everyone sorted out in relation to where they all fit on the family tree and beyond, but like solving a mystery, it all becomes clear by the end. Despite saying only a handful of words throughout the entire movie, Callan steals most of her scenes by virtue of vacant gaze alone.83/100"
789,"I went into the cinema not expecting to see a great movie, I didn't want Daniel Craig to have an American accent. However I accent didn't bother me after a few mins and the story line was alright. I found myself solving it along with the film. I would say the film is quite predicable with its red herrings but I liked the 'unexpected twist' (I put it in quotations because the movie was a but slow at revealing what we already work out.)I don't want to be to critical because I did actually enjoy it and did find myself laughing quite alot throughout.All in all I would recommend."
790,Seriously such a wild and entertaining whodunnit film! The whole cast was fantastic with Marta and the detective bring standouts. The twists and humor kept this whole film enjoyable throughout. Best movie I've seen in a while!
791,"""Afflicted by the silly proclivity of involuntary vomiting whenever she tells a lie, Marta's version of the incidence is laid bare really early on the way, which firmly shoves audience's empathy and perspective on her side as experienced spectators know all too well, that version of the story is just a guise full of cracks and holes need to be exposed, Marta turns out to be the sole inheritor of Harlan's massive fortune, which instantaneously prompts the Thrombey family to turn on her with venomous aspersion and threats. Johnson's script craftily jumps on the bandwagon of the racial sensibility by pitting Marta against the whole bunch of white rich bigots, among which, Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda, Harlan's firstborn, vehemently goes berserk with both barrels in her hypocritical outburst, but we should also feel sorry for her, as a business mogul, she is saddled with a cheating husband (Johnson) and a deadbeat son Ransom (Evans); Michael Shannon's Walter Thrombey, Harlan's youngest son, goes with a different approach, tentatively dragooning Marta with veiled menace. But, as empty vase makes the most noice, up till then, most audience would be confident that they're all red herrings (Toni Collette is toothsome in her shameless freeloader mannerism as Joni, the widow of Harlan's deceased son).""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
792,"Okay, I really enjoyed this movie however, I thought the movie would of been more intense like the girl with the dragon tattoo movie.Awesome move with great humour. I couldn't watch it again though."
793,"This homage to Agatha Christie is Rian Johnson's first film since ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" (the only other one of his films I have seen, which I thought was alright but not great.) I love Agatha Christie as well as the cast of this film, and was looking forward to an entertaining and darkly hilarious homage to classic murder mysteries. While the film has some laughs and moments of sharp writing that make it a somewhat entertaining diversion, it unfortunately feels less than the sum of its parts.The initial setup is simple: a popular and acclaimed crime novelist is found dead, with a slit throat, right after celebrating his 85th birthday in his mansion. From there, anyone related to him could possibly be a suspect. The film's first act is really strong, with great production design of the Thrombley family mansion, a good score and clever use of musical cues, sufficient character development, and some snappy and well-paced writing. After that, though, things start to get rather uneven and anti-climactic. The acting is generally good, although none of the characters get much of a range. While there are pockets here and there of good dialogue, the film's numerous attempts at political and social satire feel very hollow and forced. There are a few recurring juvenile gags that get annoying after a while as well. Parts of the film are quite entertaining for sure, but overall I'm not certain how well it holds up in its entirety or whether it really lives up to the rave reviews it has received. 6/10"
794,"What a delightful unraveling of murder mystery mayhem, carefully crafted with witty wordplay, splendid camera work, raucous audience engagement, and a tour de force performance by Daniel Craig (with honorable mention to Michael Shannon).This was a movie that overtly demanded your attention, and you were more than welcome to provide it (although given the PG-13 rating, I do question how it will hold up for minors during the first third of the movie). Rian Johnson made something that could take to the stage someday, and I think it's that kind of audience that this would compel most.To say that it delivered would be an understatement. Every minute of the run time mattered. It had this interesting way in which information was revealed in a front-loaded fashion, and yet still left you with necessary questions that you couldn't dodge, and you constantly questioned with the people around you. This will stick with me for a while, and hopefully also garner Oscar consideration for best original screenplay."
795,"Knives Out is a whodunit mystery film written and directed by Rian Johnson (Looper, The Brothers Bloom). Starring Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Ana de Armas, it is one of the most ridiculously entertaining murder mysteries to grace cinema screens in a long time.One day after celebrating his 85th birthday with his dysfunctional family at his large mansion, renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in his study room. The police are soon called to the scene to investigate the causes of Harlan's death and to determine if foul play was a factor in all of this. Joining them is the famous private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), who has his own unconventional methods of figuring out the situation, much to the chagrin of the other Thrombey family members.With its slick production values and witty dialogue, Knives Out injects so much quirky energy into what is widely considered to be an archaic genre and successfully modernises it as a result. Writer/Director Rian Johnson, who clearly has an affinity for this type of movie, takes a great amount of influence from the work of Agatha Christie, with the singular setting and oddball characters rounding off what would normally considered a surface level murder mystery. In addition to this, Johnson detracts from the usual European vibe of the genre to give the film a considerably more American feel, reminding his audience that the genre is universal and not necessarily restricted to a particular continent or culture.There is so much beautiful visual flair in this film. Each scene felt articulately laid out with such clever use of colour and symmetry. One part of the film's set involves an expensive looking seat with a plethora of knives surrounding it in a circular pattern, which can catch the viewer off guard during some important scenes. This again feels like a callback to the whodunits of decades ago, which implemented the surroundings into the story, making the audience question whether or not certain things played a role in the murder itself.Every character was used brilliantly throughout the story, with each one serving a purpose no matter how minor it seemed. All of the family members have a reason to be involved in Harlan's death and deducing who has the strongest involvement kept the film moving along at a brisk pace. However, to single out too many characters would give away the ending so I will only single out one: Daniel Craig. Craig is clearly having a wonderful time playing Benoit Blanc, who can only be described as a southern US Hercule Poirot. At first, Blanc seems like a total goofball with a funny accent but the further the story advanced, the more it felt like he was a figure the audience could trust at solving this mystery.In conclusion, while whodunits may seem dead to some, thanks to the efforts of Rian Johnson, there is proof that there is still so much enjoyment to be had. Even veteran viewers of the genre may be surprised at some of the twists the film throws at them. I urge modern audiences to give it a chance, whether you care for these types of films at all. You never know how much you may end up liking it in the end.I rate it a solid 9/10"
796,"This is my new favorite movie. All the suspense built up trough out it made the ending spectacular. It is one of those movies where you do the detective work yourself and wait till the end to see if your right. Every character got interviewed and you have to put it all together like a puzzle. 10 out of ten, would recommend it."
797,"The film was so poorly made and the ending wasn't even a surprise. There was no character development and it all seemed useless. There was no big plot twist and I just left the cinema feeling disappointed...Also, Daniel Craig had that awful accent that made him sound absolutely ridiculous. It's nothing compared to those old Poirot films"
798,"The reviews didn't prepare me for how funny this movie is. There are a lot of fast quips flying by. Listen carefully or they'll get past you. For example, one character, after hearing Daniel Craig's southern accent, says ""What is this, CSI KFC?"" Hilarious! I didn't guess the real culprit. I was sure the entire movie and I was wrong. Lots of fun following the action and the portrayals. This is not a deep movie. It has a simple message: Sit back and enjoy the ride."
799,"Knives Out tells the story of the Thrombey's, an upper class family of wealth and importance celebrating the 85th birthday of the patriarch Harlan (Plummer), a day later Harlan is found with his throat slit and every one in the family, including the servants becomes a suspect, as they all have motive.It is very unique to see a murder mystery that is completely original, not a book adaptation nor a property of long standing fiction. These are original character in a pretty tired premise. When I walked into the theatre I was expecting this to play out like any old game of clue, or Sherlock, with Benoit Blanc (Craig) playing the eccentric private detective that puts every piece together in the end. However by deviating away from the traditional mystery formula, along with a great score and masterful/controlled camerawork, it really unravels its performances and characters in a funny and suspenseful way.This is a stellar cast, the two shining members being Chris Evans as Ransom Drysdale the spoiled grandson of Harlan and Daniel Craig as the inconsiderate southern detective. Both of them are playing against their type are truly transformative in their roles. They were not James Bond or Captain America, they were two people trying to figure out how to solve the mystery looming above them. The supporting characters are also great, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield and Ana de Armas as the son-in law, daughter, son, daughter-in-law, crime scene investigator and Harlan's caretaker do not just blend into the movie as they have clear personalities and motives for what they want to do. However some of the cast do just disappear into the movie, particularly Katherine Langford and Jaeden Martell as the other two grandchildren.Given the movie's affinity for subverting expectations, it may render some plot points moot or unimportant at times. Knives Out is no exception, this movie would set up some plot points that would make the mystery loom and linger on, however when everything is revealed these plot points may not get the resolution they deserve. Also some characters really only exist for four or five lines/jokes and then are basically forgotten about by the end. However this might be because of the visual storytelling at the end. With the right context and clues, the audience can infer the real ending, based on nothing but facial expressions, prop treatment and setting displacement. This is how we know we have a true master of acting and directing, when an object is shown and it gives us much more can be deduced than just what is seen on screen.Without spoiling anything, don't go into this movie expecting a traditional murder mystery, the trailers really set it up to be one, but this is a Rian Johnson film. I understand why people were peeved at him for his treatment of Star Wars, mainly because his subversion of expectations made them mad, as people grew up with the characters and story, so in a sense they belong to the public and they didn't like the liberties he took with the new additions he made. But these characters and this story belong to him and he can do whatever he wants with them. In fact the less you know, the better. Expect some foul play."
800,"This film is such a great deconstruction of the whodunnit genre, in so many fantastic ways, left be a great ensemble cast."
801,"This film tells the investigation of a private detective who tries to solve the mystery of a very rich man's death.The stellar cast is already a joy to watch. Add the really suspenseful plot to the film, and you get a great bag of entertainment. I find the plot very suspenseful, and it really turns in a different direction every time you think you have it figured out. The production is very good as well. The scene of Daniel Craig smoking in the garden in the dark is very visually striking. I really enjoyed it!"
802,"In this politicized whodunit a wealthy family patriarch is found dead in his room. What looks like nothing more than a suicide has an air of foul play once private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) starts digging into it.This movie is comparable to the likes of Clue or Murder on the Orient Express. At the center is a very astute Sherlock Holmes-like detective and in his midst are many potential suspects.I wanted to like the movie more because it was funny and it was clever. The politicization was a bit off-putting but that wasn't what I took the most exception with. I had a problem with the main character, or at least the development of the main character.Sharing much of the screen time with Daniel Craig was Ana De Armas playing Marta Cabrera, the nurse of the deceased patriarch, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). We learned through intermittent exposition that she was the nurse and friend of Harlan Thrombey. We also learned that she was the purest character in the movie and it irked me.While the Thrombey family was primarily self-centered a-holes Marta was so angelic that she couldn't even tell a lie without vomiting. That brought about some laughs, but when combined with her overall character it made her sickeningly saintly. When Harlan predictably left his entire estate to her I kept wondering when she would reveal her true colors because no one is this pure of heart.As a matter of principle, I didn't have a problem with Harlan leaving his wealth to his nurse. There have been movies like that in which an unlikely but deserving character inherits the wealth. But the manner in which Marta was made the heir was too raw and undeveloped. There was not enough backstory and character development between the two of them to make that action a readily acceptable action. We only got a five minute scene in order to see the close relationship between Harlan and Marta, which is not nearly enough. With the absence of several scenes to show their closeness and Harlan's distance from his own family, the willing of his wealth to her was rather flat. It came off as odd or eccentric as opposed to well thought out and intentional. It was thrust in there so abruptly that I was sure Marta was playing all of them.In fact, I would have liked the movie even more if the hardworking, overlooked, and underestimated Latina was playing a role just to get rich. It would've fit far more than the hardworking nurse with a heart of gold that got an inheritance because a wealthy old man took a liking to her.I'm not eliminating the possibility that Marta did play Harlan and the entire family. There was a hint of such a scheme at two points I can remember.At one point there was a scene in which Harlan told Marta that he did what she told him and cut them all off. It was a brief exchange but it could have been a hint that Marta was pulling the strings.Then there was the end when she was sipping from the mug which read, ""My House, My Rules, My Coffee""-- it could have been her smug, ""I just played all of you"" moment. But it was hard to tell.As murder mysteries go, this was decent. You come to expect the unexpected so I wasn't blown away. The cast was great, if only the flawless character wasn't so flawless."
803,10 out of 10 to counter all the idiot star wars rejects on here.Get a life you fat turds
804,"Mystery crime has long been a neglected genre in the movie industry with cheap and boring TV flicks like Murder She Baked, etc. With its star-studded cast and intelligent plot, Knives Out is certainly a refreshing and hopefully a revitalizing comeback. Although it feels like a modern day Agatha Christie adaptation with little new to offer, all its cinematographic qualities like acting, directing, scripting, editing are top notch. Despite the abundance of leading figures, the characters are surprisingly well developed and they are far from simplistic and single-dimensional. Take Joni, for example. When it comes to her personal interests and benefits, she sees nothing wrong with scheming a large sum of money from her father-in-law. Her political views on a polarizing subject like immigration, however, are progressive and humanitarian.
Indeed, the subject of immigration is the permeating subtle theme of the movie although the main plot revolves around a crime puzzle. The protagonist is a daughter of an illegal immigrant family from Latin america. She works as a caregiver to a bunch of wealthy white people none of whom has no real accomplishments but lives a posh life by simply leeching off of the rich patriarch. Most of their qualities are pretentious and skin-deep. Even the impressive ""ancestral manor"" turns out to be an estate bought from a Pakistani tycoon some 40 years ago. I don't want to give away too much from the plot but the final scene metaphorically and hilariously clinches the underlying subject-matter.
All in all, Knives Out is an entertaining movie which certainly deserves seeing."
805,Knives Out is a not a film as much as a symphony where each instrument is tuned to the beat of the conductor. Each frame is carefully orchestrated and composed to perfection. The dialogue is metered and spoken with a contemporary Shakespearean beat.
806,"I'm not a critic. I'm a moviegoer. I went to be entertained, and I was. I loved the characters, the Christieesque plot line for a modern day, the dialogue, and the cast. I will see this again, and invite friends. Thanks so much for this movie."
807,"Rian Johnson has crafted an enjoyable new spin on the murder mystery genre. With a stacked cast led by Daniel Craig and Chris Evans having loads of fun in their roles, Knives Out is very much set in today's world and updated accordingly. I liked that the story was a complex web, but not one impossible to follow if you pay attention to the various little clues throughout the movie. Even if you can guess what will happen, there are still some extra twists that can throw you for a loop. This film is terrifically entertaining and will leave you in awe of its pay off."
808,"Rian Johnson's Knives Out takes cliches from murder mysteries and utilizes them to new effect. It's intricate, funny, and unexpectedly fast-paced while utilizing a hardworking all-star cast.Rian Johnson: I'm one of those people that really loved The Last Jedi, so there were certain expectations for me going into this movie. Needless to say, Rian Johnson shattered those expectations. He wrote a complex yet good-natured murder mystery, giving you the clues throughout the story before pulling the rug out from under you. I know that expression is extremely overused, but it's really what happens. He set up expectations for what this movie was supposed to be and crafts it to be something completely different. It's Agatha Christie meets Clue meets Crime and Punishment and I love every gut-busting second of it. The best part is that on a second viewing, every single thing has a different meaning; and every second meaning promotes dual characteristics.The Cast: Every single member leans into their characters with enthusiasm and fully commits to the roles. Daniel Craig is wonderful as the lead detective, constantly on the line between parody and real-life Sherlock Holmes. Chris Evans plays directly against his Captain America, clearly having the time of his life with it. Jamie Lee Curtis plays ruthless like no other, constantly protective yet always on offense. Michael Shannon plays a little bit into his type but ultimately shines through; he flexes his range, going from improv king to terrifying in an instantly smooth transition. Toni Colette plays comedy like no other; she somehow appropriately and sympathetically plays a spoiled rich person. Everyone else in the cast melds together perfectly. The standout of standouts is Ana de Armas. She blends drama and comedy deftly, taking her character on a wonderfully original journey. She sells every second of it."
809,"It you like whodunits, you need to check this out. Was sure I knew where this was going within the first half-hour and still enjoyed the ride. Then the story twisted again and again. Fun, clever. Acting, directing and writing are all excellent. One of the best mystery films I've seen in years."
810,This movie is not worth see cause the review doesn't make no sense a the bill boards ads scares me.
811,"When you first begin the movie, your thinking hey this character is the murder but when you get to the end you see it was actually someone else. It has twists and turns as well as comedy in it. It's worth going to see and each character has there own motive as well or maybe they don't you be the judge of that"
812,"What a slam on nurses. No need for labels, she can tell the difference between the extremely similar looking medications. This is an attack on the integrity of the nursing profession. Or maybe it is attack on immigrants, thats how immigrant nurses dispense medicine. If you haven't guessed, I am a nurse and my mother was a nurse and my grandmother was an immigrant nurse."
813,"The murder mystery isn't really a genre that has seen much exposure in Hollywood over recent years, studios more intent on setting up more profitable cinematic universes. Step up Rian Johnson with Knives Out, a classic whodunnit that brings us cinema's next great dysfunctional family.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a wealthy novelist, is found dead in his study, private eye Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought in to investigate his death, leading to clashes with the eccentric members of Harlan's combative family.With Knives Out, Rian Johnson has woven a tapestry of delightful twists and turns to keep the audience on their toes and guessing right until the end, littered with memorable dialogue and enough family feuding to last a lifetime ensuring the path to the truth is an extremely entertaining one. It's also one of the funniest films of the year, Johnson lacing the film with intricacies that can be easy to miss but play a major part in siding against such a despicable family. The attention to detail from Johnson in his narrative is nothing short of stunning.The Thrombey family would be nothing without such a high calibre ensemble bringing each and everyone of them to life with such verve and class. Daniel Craig is the star of the show with an exquisite performance as the eccentric private eye Blanc, Craig having a ball with the southern drawl and nailing the comedic beats to a tee. Ana de Armas gives her best performance to date as Marta, Harlan's nurse, the innocence and vulnerability shining through her incredibly emotive features.There isn't one member of the ensemble who feels out of place, the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis and Toni Collette bringing the sweetness as well as the viciousness when required. Chris Evans looks to be having an absolute blast playing a Tony Stark type character after playing the boy scout for so long in the MCU, his line deliveries having me in stitches at times. The great thing about Knives Out is that I have my favourites from an initial viewing however, the characters are all so good that my favourites could change every time I revisit it.Knives Out is one of the best cinematic experiences I've had all year, Rian Johnson serving up a real treat of a whodunnit for audiences around the world. If there's one character I'd love to see more of, it'd be Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc."
814,I heard only good things about this movie. Heard good user reviews and good things from friends. 5 minutes in I called the killer and the family member plot. This movie is a waste of time.
815,"Very overrated, sorry version of Clue. Daniel is Craig, horrible accent. Still don't u how he was chosen to play, Bond. This is something that I would only watch if I were, sick and bedridden, and maybe not even then."
816,I found this movie boring. Very disappointing. Just seemed to meander for 2 hours. some funny bits I will say but very few and far between. I thought Daniel Craig was joking with that accent and was going to start speaking properly!! A waste of 2 hours
817,"Overall I didn't like the feel , the character development ... the detective .. the puking ... the plot ... it was visually appealing in some ways... and the twist was interesting .. it had a lot of potential but in the end fell way short .Many people are complaining it had a political message .. it did have one and one I happen to agree strongly with . I loved how Marta was referred to from so many different countries .. no one really knew or cared they knew she was Latin this was her one thing they all mentioned at some point throughout the film. The way that was woven in was brilliant. The threat of deportation.. a privileged white guy being the antagonist in the end . All very well done and proving a point I stand strongly behind .. immigrants .. legal or not .. come here for a reason and want to protect their families just like the rest of us and we should be way more empathetic to that plight . Film makers have a responsibility to build in messages of importance , movies are not just for entertainment they should make us think , make us feel , make us question and research . Even if a movie has an opposing viewpoint I stand by that sentiment . This moved it up from a 1 to a 4.I didn't enjoy it , I would not recommend it and it felt juvenile . I really don't understand how this got an 8."
818,"Using the form of the whodunit Johnson's crafts a black comedy that it is at once a startling deconstuction of the genre and a reconstruction of the same to make a political parable about entitlement and just desserts. It is exceptionally difficult to explain the brilliance of this film without spoilers but the more you think you know what is going on or who is the bad person is the more the film will trick you. There is a central moment of the film that depends on an *extremely* clever use of expectations molding perceptions to hide what is going on and it is the single greatest moment in cinema this year. The script is a masterwork of layered meaning, jokes and characterizations. Simply word choice reveals so much-for a benign example the family's cruelty and indifference towards Marta is revealed in that none of them get the country she is from correct. There are roughly a dozen characters in this film and you feel as if you come to know all of them. And as meta as the film gets it is no mere shell game of playing around with tropes. The film at its core is discussing the ways in which race, material wealth breed resentment and cruelty. The final shot is a massive rebuke of Trumpianism and the film is like a dagger to the heart of some of the worst people in our society; this is a social satire of the first order. The shade of the final moment is thrown in righteous anger. It is simply great.Johnson, as a director, never lets the film dwell on its political import. Indeed, visually the film is an exceptionally crafted mood piece that combines classic compositions and style to create an atmosphere that is simply fun. You can almost feel Johnson robbing his hands together in delight. The visual construct is as clever as the writing in places. Each supports the other to such a degree that the film feels formed directly from Johnson's mind. The circle of knives is not only a striking central visual but it is part of the fun. It just looks cool and means something. This is a film that has a lot on its mind but finds its delights in delighting its viewers.And I have not even mentioned the best part. The acting is gobsmacking perfect. The entire cast is just so good in this. They all deftly blend the comedic and mystery elements. They hide the red herrings well. They all are having so much fun. It is unfair to select any one performance but de Armas is perfect in this. She makes a weird quirk believable. She is tough as nails, smart as a whip and vulnerable. Evans plays against type to a wonderful effect. Oh and Daniel Craig's Blanc is the funniest most endearing detective in about 30 years.I am so glad I decided to give Johnson the benefit of the doubt and see this!"
819,"Rian Johnson actually spoofs himself and the genre in this (what will soon be) modern classic.After a consensus failing on his Star Wars take with The Last Jedi, Johnson actually returns to his best and perhaps most famous roots by digging into his Breaking Bad roots. That's right. Some people might have missed it, but I picked up on it easily since that is one of my favorite shows, and Johnson directed some of its most famous (and notorious) episodes (Ozymandias....Fly respectively).Make no mistake- Knives Out is absolutely its own thing, but Johnson was not hiding his roots here. First of all, ask yourself, what was his most famous directorial scene from Breaking Bad? Was it, when Skyler chooses the knife instead of the phone in the climactic scene? Of course, and she pulled the ""knife out"" there, as in knives out. Second, wasn't Johnson the director of the notorious ""bottle episode"", which is equally hated and beloved? Well yes, and this is a claustrophobic movie mostly set in one single place- a mansion. Third, the actress (De Arma) literally acts just like ""Lydia"" in most scenes of the movie- an anxiety-ridden, desperate, back against the wall performance. He could have just put Laura Frasier in the role and you couldn't have told the difference. Fourth, the dark humor, which is generously spread throughout the movie and never forgotten. How about the cell phone usage reliance for so many scenes, but with dark humor reiterated along with it?Yes, Johnson learned a lot from Breaking Bad (as well as brought so many great episodes to it), and he brings so much of his brilliance into this fun, dark comedy. How many people caught the Game of Thrones reference with the knife throne at the end? There is just so much dark humor spread all throughout this and so many fun homages and references. Some people won't fully get it, and yes I admit it is a little over the top at times to some extent, but not enough so to say it's anything less than a great movie, especially for 2019, where originality is lacking. However, this movie has more than originality going for it. What a fun time and an immersive and enjoyable (although very slow and bumpy) ""ride"".I've now seen 1917, Richard Jewell, The Irishman, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, Joker, and some others, and ironically, if it all came down to it, this would actually be my Best Picture vote for 2019.10/10"
820,What a boring flick. Predictable and cookie cutter
821,"This is easily an Oscar nominee for best screenplay. The dialogue is crisp, intelligent and engaging. The story is tight and without any holes. This is writing in top form. And not to mention the performances. What a cast. Rain Johnson is a man who knows how to make a film. We need more movies like this."
822,"Knives Out is perhaps one of the best pictures of 2019. The strongest point is, without a doubt, Rian Johnson's script. The dialogue is so biting, smart, and outright funny that I, someone who falls asleep in movie theaters, couldn't help but to sit on the edge of my seat. The recurring misidentifying of Marta's ethnicity was a clever joke laced throughout the movie and brought to light at the most natural and creative moments. The cinematography is breathtaking, my favorite being the scene in which the Thrombleys learn that Marta will gain all of Harlan's assets. The transition from the stationary shots to the chaos-reflecting, hand-held shot following Marta fighting through the swarm of the family is brilliantly jarring. While Daniel Craig's accent is a bit odd, it fits his character as the classically stereotypical detective in a whodunnit. Chris Evan's performance as a smug killer is a refreshing take from his all-American, goody-two-shoes Captain America, proving his versatility. Knives Out is a brilliant film that I recommend to anyone and everyone."
823,"Seen a trailer for this back in the summer & couldn't wait to see it.After watching I have to say the film was really well done! The story was enticing & the twists were good! I loved the whodunit theme in this & the clever story telling also!Daniel Craig especially done well among the other actors in this film. It's the second time he plays an american with a southern accent!The film centers on a Cluedo like murder which has taken place among a family in a large house. But all is not what it seems with the death & with the detective on board, shocking revelations surrounding the mysterious death come to lightThough the film did take a while to get going & was a bit hard to understand at first, the film was ace once it did get going!Overall a great watch! 8/10"
824,"I found Rian Johnson's Star Wars film to be disappointing, but I believe in going into every movie with an open mind, and I really enjoyed 'Knives Out'.It's an intricate mystery story that feels clever, witty, and made with a lot of passion and care. An early twist in the plot puts this film on another level, distinguishing it from other murder mysteries and making it a unique experience. The characters are very distinctive, and the brisk pace means that the 130 minute runtime is never boring. The theme of self-made success is also beautifully explored.I found the ending to be slightly rushed, but overall, the film comes across as funny, smart, and unpredictable, all at the same time. Would certainly recommend giving it a watch."
825,"Being someone who has devoured all of Agatha Christie's work, I thought this movie would be fun. I was not dissapointed! A great murder mystery with so many references to Christie, Sherlock Holmes, Murder, She Wrote etc. If you like a good murder mystery, watch this ASAP!"
826,"A fun movie. I suspect writer/director Rian Johnson of attempting to sneak in a political message, but if so it is completely drowned out by the noise of merrily preposterous whodunnitry.Daniel Craig is a very good actor, so he gets away with being miscast as a Deep-South detective. Everybody else is effortlessly perfect, but it's really Ana de Armas' movie. She's excellent as the nurse to an uber-successful author (Christopher Plummer) whose family assembles for a get-together which was never going to turn out well. Ms de Armas' endearing rabbit-in-the-headlights quality belies a brilliantly controlled performance.Lots of delights elsewhere. Great to see Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette and Don Johnson enjoying themselves so much. Interesting to see Chris Evans out of his Captain America uniform. K Callan has very few lines but reliably steals every scene she's in. And there's Frank Oz, delightfully deadpan, plus a cameo from the mighty M Emmet Walsh.It's designed, filmed and edited with enthusiasm. Nothing to dislike, really. Undemanding entertainment."
827,"Knives OutI really enjoyed this movie.This was a very old style who-done-it in very much the style of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot, we had a many stranded labyrinthine plot unravelled slowly by our hero detective followed by a denouement.This was very much a talking movie with little action of any kind so if you are looking for a car chase resolution this is not the movie for you.Daniel Craig did a fine job as Benoit Blanc, the drawling accent did not slip once and he dominated every scene, the whole cast did a good job occupying their respective stereotypes.It must have been good as try as I might I couldn't predict the ending."
828,"I give it a 2 rating just because I've seen worse. So many plot holes makes it predictable. Pretty lame story writing to. I am baffled by the high rating. Just saw Little Women which was great with flawless acting. Casting, acting, dialog and story in this movie
is complete carbage."
829,"What a great cast and a rather twisty plot, but man, this movie moved along slower than a snail on Valium!"
830,"Absolutely no idea who would in their right mind greenlight this Sherlock parody.
I would love to look in the eyes of those who said - yeah, lets cast English actor for English detective movie and make him talk with american south accent.
The plot was obviously bad, you could see that from the trailer, bu c'mon... I tried to watch it because of the cast and all I can say is that now I hate these actors!To be fair I was obviously expecting too much from a movie that has rotten tomatoes score in its ""final trailer""..."
831,Cast was too large... not everyone has a chance to speak !!! Felt as if I'd seen it before... Just long enough that the audience can feel confused and exhausted... its greatest feature!
832,"Well, the movie is ok , not bad. But, I didn't see any fun at all. Cast is too good for this movie. I liked acting though."
833,"Knives Out is one of my top favorite movies of all time. Not only is it the greatest whodunit ever, but it is also a wonderful and comedic story of friendship filled with warm emotions. It is visually extravagant, endlessly witty, and immensely satisfying. It boasts an exceptional ensemble cast as well, who are a joy to watch as they battle their way through the film's exciting twists and turns in an effortlessly entertaining way. In particular, Ana De Armas is incredible as always, Daniel Craig gives my favorite performance of his, and Chris Evans is surprisingly brilliant. I would highly recommend watching this film, especially with friends!"
834,"Do not be fooled by it's presumption, this is no great mystery."
835,Really good film Definitely in the top 10 movies of last year for me
836,"Great story, but plot is way too slow. Daniel Craig's fake accent is strange. I really wanted to like this movie. But, it just wasn't captivating enough. Although I can't say exactly what shouldve been done differently."
837,What was the point in this if you're told who the killer is straight away. It's not a murder mystery and it was dragged out And boring. I thought it was gonna be exciting like a whodunnit? The good score is for the acting and some of the jokes. Apart from that it dragged
838,"Wanted something better out of Rian Johnson and the fantastic cast he had assembled here. Instead got 2 hours of dull dialogues and an obvious if not predictable plot with no real ""moments"" in it. Underwhelming."
839,Poor film.sadly the script is woeful.the direction really poor.its equal to a TV movie.the highlights which were few was the character of the house.thats it.daniel Craig does his best & adds a funny accent but gutted as was looking forward to the film.the film highlights what's wrong with most of the cinema these days which is poor scripts poor direction.rian Johnson is a joke
840,"I really think it's a great movie, whether it's the character ,the story or the plot. Especially the ending revealed the truth let me have to admire the screenwriter's brain circuit!!"
841,"I fell for the hype. Nothing special at all. Not even a good story, nor plot, nor twist."
842,The cast and everything in this movie was perfect I hope i see a lot of movies like this one.
843,"Brilliance totally Brilliance
Totally Unexpected
Love the movie , it's too gripping and enjoyfull"
844,This movie captures the feeling of a clue game more than the clue movie. The story has twists that are possible to be seen and anticipated but that does not draw away from the overall enjoyment of the movie. The length of the movie is arguably perfect and it's climax is nothing short of a good detective story finale. Around the middle of the film I thought: where are they going with this? And they managed to make me stay interested in the movie till the end.
845,After watching Chris Evans convince the world he was Captain America this movie convinced me of his range as an actor.It was great fun watching him do a completely convincing turn as a scheming self serving bad guy.The rest of the cast was wonderful as the family you would not wish on anybody.
846,"It's that entertaining that I watched at 3am night before watching it I felt sleepy yet while watching my sleep was gone that great and gripping entertaining movie it was!The cast was really a great things besides the score and cinematography
Really a must watch!A Twisted tale of cinema which makes me fall in love again with suspense thriller genre!"
847,Ana De Armas is the most beautiful creature to ever exist on the face of this planet. FACT!!
848,"It's fun to watch, it is highly entertaining, it has great cast that delivered amazing performances - ""Knives Out"" is a mystery you wouldn't miss. Chris Evans does very well in this movie and his character Ransom brings more drama, funny situations and some memorable lines. I didn't really expect the ending to be so highly entertaining, but the storyline managed to keep me on the edge of my seat. I totally recommend this movie, it's awesome!"
849,"An old family patriarch dies by murder and on this situation arises a cluedo. A secret person consults the well known detective Benoit Blanc, which starts to untie the knot of relations of the millionaire family in that high house. He gets help by the service maid of the dead patriarch.I guess this one will be in the top 10 of crime comedies at the end of the year. 'Knives Out' has some fine humor in it and leaved a smile on my face at the end. I like the style that tells the story very clear and hides the turns perfectly. There is also some fun in it - the whole cinema laughed strongly at some points. The cast is wonderful. Only near the end there was a scene, which was a little awkward, so I set my rating one star lower. But all in all it's a very good movie and we were well entertained by a worthy movie."
850,"Knives Out is for me a successful connection between comedy, mystery and thriller, which brings back a genre that I love very much: The classic detective films, here constructed as a modern cluedo. The plot is predictable in some places, but you still lack the little detail that makes the film unpredictable. It is a closed product from front to back with good acting performance, an intelligent script, good callbacks and an excellent atmosphere. It's an 8.3 for me."
851,"I woke up this morning and watched this movie - I really loved it
Set in the old fashioned who-dunnit Agatha Christie murder mystery styleWell done!"
852,"I've never been this entertained by a movie because the actors did such an incredible job. I've seen reviews saying that they thought the plot was too predictable... they are lying. I have seen the movie four times and am going for a fifth, there is nothing bad about his movie."
853,Rian Johnson delivers as always. Really well written movie! Probably best screenplay for 2019
854,I was anxious to see this one and definitely not disappointed ... keeps you guessing till the end !
855,"""Knives Out"" (2019 release; 130 min.) looks at the demise of Harlan Thrombey, the 85 yr. old patriarch and successful novelist. As the movie opens, the housekeeper finds him dead on a couch, an apparent suicide. We then go to ""One Week After the Demise of Harlan Thrombey"", as the police have gathered several people for interrogating them as to what exactly has happened, including Marta, the nurse caretaker, Linda, the patriarch's daughter, and Richard, Linda's husband. We soon are introduced to yet more central characters... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from writer-director Rian Johnson, best known for directing the 2017 ""Star Wars - Tee Last Jedi"". Here he brings us a murder mystery in line with those ""who dunnit"" mysteries from Agatha Christie and the like. Much of the movie takes place in the patriarch's Massachusetts house and in that sense the movie feels very much like a theater plat at times. It takes a nit of work to fully understand who is who and who may have done what. All if it is tied together by Daniel Craig's character, a private investigator who was hired by someone in the family (but we don't know who). I am not spoiling anything when I say that it is absolutely impossible to figure out who the true culprit(s) is/are, so you just sit back and wait for the last 20 min. or so when all is revealed. Marts is played by rapidly riding Cuban actress Ana de Armas, whom we also saw in ""Yesterday"" not long ago, and will seemingly be everywhere in 2020. Jamie Lee Curties has a second-tier role as Linda, as does Don Johnson as Richard. And Christopher Plummer has an even smaller role as the patriarch. Please note that the movie's title is indeed taken from the Radiohead song of the same name (Rian Johnson being a huge Radiohead fan), but that's where the connection stops (the Radiohead song does not play in the movie).""Knives Out"" premiered at this Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to positive reaction and opened wide in late November. The movie has performed much better than expected at the box office, being a genuine box office hit, and it is currently also rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. I really didn't plan on seeing this but seeing those numbers and sky-high ratings made me change my mind. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended nicely (a good 30 people in a small theater). After all this, I'm sorry, but am I missing something? I mean, sure, this is a pleasant divertisment, nothing less, nothing more (for me anyway). But this is just okay and nowhere near as good as a bunch of other films I have seen this year (Apollo 11, The Mustang, The Lighthouse, The Report, The Two Popes, The Irishman, The Peanut Butter Falcon, Parasite, Waves, Richard Jewell, etc.). Of course I encourage you to check it our, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
856,"This movie encompasses everything a movie of this genre should be: Intelligent, interesting, engaging, surprising, stimulating, intriguing, and humorous to boot. Everything clicked perfectly: the writing, the editing, the acting, the atmosphere and the music. We are movie buffs enjoying movies both at home and at the theater. Knives Out is hands down the most entertaining movie of 2019 and deserves to be placed on the list of top 100 movies of all time."
857,"The movie is very intelligent
I liked every part of the movie , the start , the middle and the ending.
The story is simple as it's a death of a man to be investigated. everything seems to be taking us into a normal story where you keep searching for the killer till you reach the killer in the end , however it's a very new plot that I've not seen like before.
even though it looks similar to A murder on the orient express movie however it's much better , every character has a significant role to play , you can't take any character out of the movie even the one who was found dead in the beginning of the movie. The flash back technique is very well used in the movie , you can't feel like it's overused or something , it's very useful and brings more interesting facts during the movie.
The plot is one of the best to watch in such kind of movies.
Even the comedy is very well used and really very funny in the scenes it was used for.I really enjoyed the movie and really encourage every one to watch and enjoy it."
858,"I went with my wife since she wanted to see this movie. This genre is not my thing, but hey, she goes to movies I like and so it's time for me to reciprocate. I enjoyed the story, actors and the movie. Definitely recommend."
859,"Wonderful, not perfect but with enough good will, good casting and fun script that any shortcomings can be easily forgiven. I wonder how many of the really bad reviews are because of TLJ and that the the alright dingbats in this movie are not well represented!"
860,"If I were to briefly describe Knives Out, then it would be constantly engaging and entertaining. If you were not a big fan of The Last Jedi then I urge you to check this film out and see that Rian Johnson is a more capable director when he is working on his own. It's a film with issues that are minor and were the only issues I had with the film. The film does have some political subtext to it which I liked but there were some areas where it was a little on the nose. It didn't take me out of the movie but I wished it had been handled a little better. This movie has a bunch of A-list actors and they all bring their A-game. Every performance in this movie is pretty great but Daniel Craig, Chirs Evans, and Ana de Armas steal every scene they are in. It can be a little hard to get used to Craig's heavy southern drawl at first but you eventually get used to it. Chris Evans is a nice counterweight to everyone's craziness. I felt he was one of the funniest characters in the movie except for one joke. Ana de Armas is a great protagonist to follow throughout the film along with Daniel Craig. All 3 of them disappear into their roles and portray their characters almost perfectly. It's a great redemption film for Chris Evans from Red Sea Diving Resort. The script is pretty great. There are tons of clues hidden beneath each line of dialogue and it all feels very natural. This allows for Johnson's comedic writing to shine. He is able to cleverly insert jokes that most of the time are pretty hilarious. The reason the comedy didn't work that well in The Last Jedi for me was that it felt forced and didn't always align well with the tone but the comedy shines here because it fits the film's tone perfectly. While not every joke is hilarious, a majority of them are. The jokes that go along with certain characters fit their character pretty well. Some of the funniest lines in the movie are delivered by Michael Shannon and Daniel Craig because the jokes they tell perfectly fit their characters. The story is fairly simple but Rian Johnson throws a lot of simple twists throughout that makes it feels unique. The film decides to reveal what actually happened to the victim halfway through the film and it turns into a cover up which then progresses to a pretty major twist that I never saw coming but felt necessary and made sense to the narrative. The music was also pretty good. It added tension and was interesting to listen to while the events unfolded. Overall, Knives Out is a great murder mystery with great performances, a great script, hilarious jokes, and some interesting twists."
861,"Excellent movie with all the twists & turns you expect from a classic whodunnit flix.Daniel Craig is in his elements as takes on the role of private detective. Music , background score , set design are wonderful. Not a single dull moment in the movie...after a long time , i enjoyed a movie which teases it audience in guessing who , why and how the murder was committed....i loved it!!"
862,"Very watchable but by the end realised I didn't really care who did it, or didn't. No real drama or suspense, but some good dialogue and light laughs."
863,"I have mostly enjoyed this movie. Fun quirky murder mystery. Beautiful performance from top level actors portraying colorful characters. But two things spoiled it for me.Ryan Johnson is like M. Night Shyamalan on steroids. A new twist every 10 minutes. By the end of the movie it felt heavy and artificial. I was more annoyed than surprised.""Relevant"" jokes were sometimes cringy, and they certainly will not age well. This movie could be a long time classic. But instead, in 10 years many jokes will feel dated and awkward.The movie is worth seeing but don't wait too long."
864,Knives Out is fun little whodunit with great cast and wonderful score but I don't think the script is that good. When I watched it for the first time I thought it's predictable and Chris Evans' character is like too obvious. I also didn't care about political discussions. I liked the homages to Sleuth and Craig's accent was great. I had it at 4 but now it's 3.5.
865,This is a really fun movie. I was expecting more of a comedy but I wasn't disappointed at all. Phenomenal cast overall and Daniel Craig rules. His over the top accent is perfect and I'm really glad Lakeith Stanfield is getting a lot of work this year guy is great.
866,"""Knives Out"" puts a new twist on the classic ""whodunnit"" mystery story. It is very entertaining and enjoyable, combining equal parts suspense and comedy. The dialogue is witty, the plot is (mostly) original, and the cast is superb. The
""Clue""-esque setting and characters are mostly enthralling. This film will satisfy most casual and hardcore moviegoers alike. However, ""Knives Out"" doesn't exactly break any new ground. It isn't revolutionary as a movie, or even as a mystery. It works hard to be unique, but stops just short of breaking away from similar films. Also, some political banter slightly taints the movie, but doesn't ruin it. All in all, ""Knives Out"" is definitely worth a watch, maybe even a re-watch with friends, but it fails to become one of the greats."
867,"Great combination of mystery, suspense and comedy. I can see myself watch it again. Awesome cast and acting."
868,"But I guess that's how the structure of a murder mystery goes. The closer you get to solving the crime the more your investment pans out.
It's starts off being humorous from the moment the movie begins, and the laugh out loud moments never end.
Sometimes it seemed like a waste of a great ensemble cast because a lot of people were not doing much but then you realize sometimes it's the little things that get the biggest laughs, it makes sense that the players are all-stars.
I enjoyed the whole thing."
869,"Awful, boring, derivative. The script was unoriginal, the acting was diabolical...especially Daniel Craig. Some talented actors, but they were all lurking in a Gothic mansion shouting rubbish at each other. Why Daniel Craig's character was even in the movie is the biggest mystery. And why he was declaiming ""audition-piece"" monologues in a comedy Southern accent is anybody's guess. The vomiting heroine was a very off-putting character trait. Total tosh. Boo"
870,Had it figured out in 1st 30 minutes or so. By all the good reviews I thought it was going to be a bit of a brain teaser. Being able to read personalities quickly and a great judge of character is as important as facts and clues
871,"Its an old fashioned whodunit mystery with Mr Bond putting on his best Kevin Spacey accent, and its likeability rides on de Arma's adorability as always. The problem is the rest of the cartoon is a bit heavy handed, the ""white"" family are all terrible people, caricatures to the point where they even mention the kid is alt-right. The good people are of course illegals, but the film spoils its own message that people given everything are ruined with hypocrisy, it is after all an ideology built on inherent contradiction."
872,"I think everyone is sick of the SGI tripe with studs & hotties who can barely deliver a line let alone act.Knives Out has all the makings of great who-dunnit movie. Brilliant acting / plot / script / directing.Hollywood, please make more of these kind of intelligent movies."
873,"I looked forward to seeing this after a promotional appearance by Jamie Lee Curtis. It was fun even with the obvious holes in the plot. The movie is marred by the gratuitous and at the same time boring profanity.Daniel Craig uses one accent at the very beginning then chances it shortly after. The movie did have some plot twists. All in all, the movie plays like a Sunday afternoon TV movie."
874,"KNIVES OUT MOVIE - Rated PG-13 for thematic elements including brief violence, some strong language, sexual references, and drug materialWOW what a huge cast, Daniel Craig with a southern accent - ha what a stretch, that added comic relief throughout the film for me.
It opens with a policeman interviewing each sibling or family member of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who is now dead, was an interesting introduction to each character as they were questioned, but boring to me with the same chair and back and forth memories in audio and not visual! Its a twisted who-dunit murder mystery like an Agatha Christie, with a today's touch. The film has many of those Christie tropes of a detective warning us about foul play, marking everyone a suspect, and setting up all of the clues in plain sight. It all comes down to 60 million in cash, a publishing company and the mansion that everyone believe they deserve, or at ""least their cut"". The ""trump troll"" and ""some"" lines open your eyes and smile that this mystrigue is not set up in the past, but today. Yet the characters, screen set and back-drop are in no way, anyone I know of, and I've met many many people. The short political subtext thrust the audience into today, but also a narcissistic home and selfish family your glad you dont really know.
It has an all-star cast - I was happy to see some of the ""old"" stars back, Christopher Plumber - the Father, Don Johnson - who plays a son, Jamie Lee Curtis - daughter, Micheal Shannon, - is a son, ( that has a Trump loving son played by actor; Jaden Martell - and I found that to be a funny satire because the actor, Micheal Shannon is a big mouth progressive liberal). Toni Colette - daughter, Daniel Craig - the investigator, and Ana de Armas- the nurse care giver of the Father. ALL were funny and great in acting especially Ana de Armas who I dont really know but look forward to seeing her in another movie soon. All except, Toni Colette she was TERRIBLE, spewing lines as puke, over acting, she was worse than the 2 German Shepherds that were cast in the film. Every time she was in a scene she ruined it, deflated the energy and believability, constantly unprepared off tone and pace, I would not hire her to narrate a elementary school science film, BUT ENOUGH about her.
Each Character's history and perspective of what happened to the Father (murdered) because of their personal past and recent interaction with him, is Lived-out from the past memories initiated by the verbal back and forth questioning as Daniel Craig the southern Investigator keeps searching. All are waiting for the big ""surprise"" The WILL reading, that shocks the characters and family members, but not the audience. I almost fell asleep, and just smiled no laughs, good acting except Toni, (as I mentioned earlier) but the plot was not a surprise, so I give it a C. If its raining and you've got nothing else to do, wait till its on tv and boor yourself then."
875,"Knives Out is a who done it mystery thriller directed by Rian Johnson. The same director who did The Last Jedi, and has garnered an infamous reputation because of that film as well as his reaction to fan backlash. However, this movie is much more in Johnson's wheelhouse than Star Wars. He excels in more grounded thrillers, which is what this film is. Rian Johnson is a competent director if given the proper material.This is the first mystery thriller of its kind to come out in theatres since Murder on the Orient Express I believe. I liked that film better, but Knives Out, while not great, is a fun time with a stellar cast. You have amazing actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon. Daniel Craig and Chris Evans steal the movie for me, mainly because I love those two as actors. If I had to pick Daniel Craig is the stand out performance here. Yes, his southern accent is over the top, but I think was intentional. Ana de Armas does good in the movie as well. I like her in Blade Runner 2049, and I like her here too.The film is very well shot especially inside the family mansion, which looks fantastic and gives off a great sense of style and atmosphere. Being inside this house gives you the feeling you're watching a period movie, even though it takes place in modern day. Unfortunately, the outside shots don't invoke the same kind of atmosphere.This film, for a who done it story, takes a very interesting turn. It starts out as your typical who done it mystery. But then it gives you significant info early on to make you think you who the culprit is throughout the entire second act, only to spin it around again at the end. It really plays on your expectations. Though, if you were expecting a more straightforward mystery story this might not be for you.The film does get a bit slow in the middle. I'm not saying those scenes didn't need to be there, but I'm just saying the second act is slower isn't as interesting as the first and third acts. Plus a couple of the characters feel pretty stock and disposable.Overall, Knives Out is a fun mystery flick. It's not a masterpiece, but it's style, cast, and character interactions make it a fun time at the movies."
876,"Idiots like Jeremy Jahns and the legion of fans he brainwashed into hating Star Wars will hate this movie because it's Rian Johnson and they're still salty over The Last Jedi. People like Chris Stuckmann, Jared Buckendahl, LC Screen Talk, And myself will actually look at this movie through the lens of actual analysis from a filmmmaking perspective, unlike that hack Jeremy Jahns. This is one of my favorite movies of the year and don't let dumb salty Star Wars fans like Jeremy The Dictator Tell you differently.This is a witty script from Rian Johnson, with well thought out characters. It is witty, funny and eccentric. I loved every minute of this movie.Salty Star Wars fans like Jeremy will automatically hate because it's Rian Johnson. They need to grow up"
877,"Completely bland with truly terrible acting.
Cinematography is cold and uninspiring.
What can I say.
The first reviewers must be the same ones who do TripAdvisor.."
878,"Knives out is to Agatha Christie what the Last Jedi is to Star Wars.
A totally unrelated story, some inspiration, some good parts, some bad parts, some good humor, some bad humor, som awful humor (the p***ing when lying) some generally bad twists. All in all an average movie in a great setting with good acting and some awkwardness that draws it down. Rian thinks he is clever, but he is not. Wish I had not paid to see it."
879,"One would think that if you assembled a cast of good actors and made a passable whodunnit with a fair, hackneyd plot and then added a spoof factor, it would work.
Not so.
This is a film to sleep through. The spoof factor is submerged in the sheer tedium of the pace.
The cast performance is woeful, the sound levels are dreadfully managed, the camera work is weak, film is an hour too long and from intro to credits the pace never leaves the flat line.
Destined for the bottom ranks of the streamers."
880,"The movie kicks off with a very promising dark, ironic tone. But that promise isn't sustained throughout the movie."
881,Good and The element of surprise in the end was a beautiful film finale; But deviate a little from realism.
882,"Wonderful movie with a great story, great cast and great entertainmentRating is lowered by people not looking for the perfect ""crime mystery"" movie, but for ... whatever."
883,"The murder mystery within a murder mystery, exceptionally well played and directed. If you love this genre, you'll love the movie, and appreciate the twists."
884,"Written and directed by Rian Johnson. won the oscar for the screenplay. Christopher Plummer is ""Grandpa "". we watch the cops and an investigator, played by Daniel Craig, question the family, one by one. in flashback. everyone in the family is a little quirky, so there are some funny moments, funny lines, cleverly done. fun to listen to british daniel craig try a a southern drawl. and i almost didn't even recognize Jamie Curtis. co-stars Chris Evans, Toni Collette, Don Johnson, Ana de Armas. Turns out someone (accidentally ?) gets knocked off, and we're kind of on a fun ride-a-long as the cops question the possible perps. you'll probably figure it out ahead of time, if you really pay attention... as neil simon told us in murder by death, sometimes they decide in the last couple pages who really did it. its fun!"
885,Fails at the first hurdle: a thriller that don't thrill. 2 hours wasted watch.
886,"Slow moving, boring drudge, star studded cast but may as well have cast unknowns, Daniel Craig's accent makes me want to punch the TV when he talks & the twist was neither unexpected or surprising. 2 stars purely for the cast. Could possibly be prescribed for insomnia."
887,"I made an hour into this before the nauseating preaching, posturing and virtue signalling of this ensemble cast of self entitled sanctimonious fools became too much.It starts okay and there are some big names but the politics is slapped on so hard and the 'right on' moralising and blatant agenda that the idiotic writer is promoting, is so present that it begins to stick in your throat.The poor, butter wouldn't melt, hard working, undocumented (yeah that means illegal) immigrant must be saved at all costs from this gaggle of horrible and evil white individuals.Johnson really is a talentless hack and this film is as jarring and as awful as the horrific accent that Daniel Craig woefully attempts throughout the film. It's like someone has asked him to create something that is a cross between Tom Hank's Forrest Gump and Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday.When people talk about Hollywood looking down at unenlightened riff raff and feeling that they need to educate us all, this is the kind of vehicle that they use. You can just imagine them congratulating themselves at how clever and virtuous they are at the wrap parties.Self absorbed trash that thinks itself really insightful but is nothing more than a clenched fist in the air. How this fool of a writer/director continues to make films is beyond me."
888,Written so poorly I had trouble watching it. Fell asleep the first attempt at watching it. This time I wish I had fallen asleep. Predictable and talks down to the viewers.
889,"Every time I rewatch this movie I see another shade of the extreme foreshadowing. There's a genius to the directing and performances that could only come from someone with a complete vision of the final piece. Armes deserved an Oscar for how subtle she plays some moments, and I love how it feels scrappy at times, like an old English ""Midsummer Murders"" episode."
890,"Really liked this movie, the plot starts with something very simple: as usual a murder in a big house and family full of secrets. When you think you get the story right and solve the murder by yourself it's completely wrong. Daniel Craig made a great performance, with his accent and the funny yet complex metaphors that he make, transforming him in a detective you should not underestimate."
891,"This movie was over hyped, but it's still good, and safe for the whole family to watch together. Sure, there are some hard to believe things, but it's a movie, people! The character who throws up is not believable, but it's not done in a gross out manner, if that worries you.The one thing that I admit I couldn't get past was Daniel Craig doing that strong Southern accent. They should have either changed the accent or changed the actor. Craig was fine, but he's just the wrong person to be given that accent to play, and I found it distracting. Imagine Tom Cruise doing a strong Cockney accent in a movie, especially when everyone else in it spoke normally. Distracting, wrong person, wrong accent!This movie is not particularly funny, but it's light and enjoyable. Hollywood should make more movies like this, without gratuitous language and sex, but with an entertaining plot and not a lot of ""messages"".I totally disagree with anyone who found this political. I hate ""sucker punches"" in movies, where disdain is shown for one side, especially when you aren't expecting it. I didn't think that happened here, and I am Conservative. Shots were taken at the extreme right and the extreme left, the legal status of mother was just part of the story without taking a side, and was only used to motivate the nurse to comply."
892,"So me and Mom finally watched this movie a few weeks after I found it on Amazon Prime Video. It's a pretty fun mystery with Daniel Craig as the investigating detective, Chris Evans as one of the family suspects, and Ana de Armas as the domestic who helps guide Craig in the solving. Oh, and I also liked Christopher Plummer as the family patriarch. So on that note, Mom and I highly recommend Knives Out."
893,"I personally enjoyed it, but oniy because I prepared myself for a barrage of liberal political messages. The plot is very good, casting was marvelous, certain actors were a bit stiff but overall it was pretty good. I knew who was involved in the murder pretty early but the how was fun to find out. Daniel Craig's accent is horrible, but other than that it was a decent movie. Overall a 6 out of 10 it should have been a lot better but this is Hollywood nowadays."
894,Not what I was expecting. Very slow and predictable. Kinda meh TBH. If you are a fan of whodunnits then this is not a movie for you. It does not leave you on the edge of your seat guessing or wanting more. It is probably one of the worse movie I have ever seen. I only rated it what I did because of the cast. Other than that this movie won't be viewed by me again. Take a hard pass on this and don't waste your time.
895,Rian Johnson has made an absolutely brilliant Comedy/Crime movie here. Will always remain as nothing less than one of my all time favourite movies. The way he weaves the comedy into the plot is truly brilliant. The acting is terrific. Well done good sir.
896,"This movie is not funny at all. It just failed to deliver a comedy. It is sort of watchable, but it is essentially boring. It happens from time to tome that a highly praised movies I do not find interesting, but I do understand when why they are praised. This one... I have not a clue.The story is flat, the attempt to twist things totally not interesting and overall superfluous as paradoxical as it sounds. This comedy is supposed to be kind of intellectual one, as it is not slapstick, so there has to be something else. I see nothing. You can watch it as some sort of expensive production of a TV episode of something, just for its cast but I fail to understand what all these high class actors are doing. Supporting what? Story, scenery, accents...? You could put there any group of average actors and the movie would have had the same quality.But these days, the quality of entertainment got so low, so, yes, from that perspective this is a super movie. I am sure it will be very soon forgotten.And I am very certain that people went to see this movie attracted by the cast thinking the same as me that a movie cannot be nothing if it gathers so many stars. Sorry, it still is nothing. At least as a comedy, it is an attempt, a very expensive high-school exercise with all fancy scenery, camera and all that, and yet nothing funny. Not a single thing."
897,"The movie pretends to be an original ""mind blowing story"", however it's absolutely predictable, with some irrelevant characters and very cliche dialogues."
898,"Captivating who done it. When the criminal was arrested at the end, the Massachusetts state police and the New York State police were both there to make the arrest."
899,"Good one-timer movie with great potential, ruined by poor, usual and boring tools for revelations..Its good family comedy/drama crime story.. Some things and ideas were cliché , some were good and funny.
Certainly its not movie which you will return to every 2 3 4 months like ocean eleven or predator, but it has quality..
Im not the one who trashes Johnson for Last Jedi but i dont think he is some kind of genius either.. Knives Out is very good one-timer with incredible cast and with the most beautiful living thing on the Earth (Ana de Armas).
My problem with this movie is the cheesy , predictable and very usual choice of ending and picking the tools to create final revelation.
The hidden flashbacks are key and its sad (or stupid ?) to decide NOT to show them to audience because you as the viewer cant play along and decifer who is the killer or the bad guy..
The most and second (but the biggest) problem is second half of the story. It derails from solving the murder case and focuses on social drama regarding with money and greed..
I mean i was very saddened how Johnson decided to finish this movie bc it derailed from detective crime comedy/drama to very mediocre and usual stuff with good guy (de Armas) and bad guy (..?..)
Lastly , i blame Johnson to create very stupid and unnecessary political message by trying to say very liberal-ish ""Trump bad, illegal immigrants Good, common sense BAD , socialism Good ) . I mean, almost every movie by those very soft directors MUST annoy the half of audience and losing the touch with reality."
900,This is one of those movies that you can rewatch and every time it gets better than the first. Amazing cast. Great acting.
901,"The highly precise, accurate and mature script, plus the brilliant performances of stars, advanced cinematic skills, retro music and atmosphere presentation, and the direct and powerful irony and allusion to real politics constitute this high-level entertainment movie. It's almost a textbook case presentation. Of course, it's hard to praise greatness, but it's done stably and excellently."
902,"I dont know how he screwed up on Last Jedi, but this movie is absoulutley great! This movie proves there are still original stories in Hollywood. Stop rebooting movies and make more of this. 10 stars all the way. I absolutely loved it."
903,"Starts out as your average mystery movie, but with tons of plot twist and turns, you never get the sense of how the movie will end!"
904,"There is every moment twist. Which is you think now movie ends and what's next but after five minute moive rose with roar of 🦁 lion ....one time I think that the detective is foolish detective but he is awysome in end....It's case in which ,
First homicidal murder plan become accidental homiside and then suicide."
905,"The film echoes the disintegration of the family with the book's warning of the eventual destruction of modern civilization, and alludes to the seemingly stable development of modern American society, but in fact, it hides many contradictory situations."
906,"One if the best mystery movies that I have scene in a long time. At times Hitchcockesq, at times ful color Noir. Thrilling film that keeps you guessing right up to the end. Bravo Rian Johnson and your excellent cast!"
907,"Knives out is one of a really good Crime and detective movies all the times
And the perfect acting from Chris evans and Ana de Armas is making the movie well played, the directing and the story line is very strong and the planning and the surprising end, story line is full of real life things like the family fights for the money and the legacy, the movie shows us the real world in this time of life, no real love left even inside the families, it shows us that no good left inside the hearts , Knives out should be sorted to the one of the best detective movies all the time.
And i hope that Knives out 2 well be good just like it's first one."
908,"The mystery lies in the question, ""Who killed Harlan Thrombey and make it look like a suicide?"" Every family member has a motive because of their stained relationship with Harlan. The kid in me still loves Cluedo, and so I decided to watch.It becomes apparent who killed Harlan, and that what will happen to the fortune and mansion. It was Ransom who helped Harlan's nurse escape after the will was read, and the family turned on her. And his course of presence and action with the nurse in addition to his name makes it obvious.The truth is affirmed when the detective revealed his deductions. It was Ransom who swapped the contents of the nurse's medication vials and stole the antidote. But the nurse was able to tell the difference between medication, and gave him the correct one. She thought she gave the wrong one, and hence, Harlan decided to kill himself.Later on, we are reminded how messed up the family is, and how they treated the nurse. In the end, the nurse finally accepts what is given to her in the will. THE END?"
909,"Exaggerated yet engaging acting and story in the vein of old crime stories.
Nice ambience and Daniel Craig's entrance is impressive. It is overcomplicated (even for this genre) and the social message (while not unjustified) is a bit heavy handed."
910,"If you suspect someone of murder, for good reason. Why meet them alone in an abandoned building? Helps the plot but doesn't make any actual sense."
911,"Needed more knives, took a while to get used to Daniel Craig's accent"
912,Rian delivers another great cinematic experience. A taut script and stellar cast gave him the tools he needed to deftly direct one of the most entertaining films in the last few years. And it was fun to see Don Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis rise to the occassion alongside such an esteemed group of actors. Bravo!
913,"This was simply a refreshing movie in a time when it seems original ideas are running thin. It is a simple whodunnit much in the spirit of Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, with a wonderful twist at the end. The acting is superb all around, but especially so for Daniel Craig who plays a southern dogged private investigator who will not give in until the case is solved. He did such a good job that the producers have signed Craig on for at least one more film for this unexpected franchise. It was also wonderful to see Don Johnson playing a different kind of role for him. I highly recommend this film for anyone to see, and I almost guarantee you will enjoy this."
914,"Bizarrely original with a sense of suspense drawn from almost nowhere throughout the movie, on the edge of my seat til the end."
915,"First of all: hooray for Tony Collete. What a gifted actress. And then Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon: great picks and good actors! But i'm sorry to say Ana de Armas wasn't a great match with this role and this director. Her acting is not very believable (stop with the constant sighing! It's tiring and your director should've stopped you from doing so). Double oh Graig has a painfull accent and other then that not very much to play with.And then there is the mystery... oh boy. Agatha Christie for beginners. First rule: it's always the butler. Or better said: someone that isn't acting suspicious, but cooperative. Second rule: if halfway the movie the mystery seems to have been unravelled, the mystery is definatly not unravelled. And third: never forget the emphasized details: they always lead to the solution of the mystery.Agatha Christie for the advanced: play with the expectation of the seasoned mystery reader, play with those three rules and mix em up. That unfortunatly didn't happen here.And finally: Yes it had a few laughs, but not enough to be a comedy. And yes it was suspensefull at times, but not enough to get me on the edge of my seet.So as a big fan of murder mysteries: the average British dectective series has better plots. And blaming Star Wars expectations? That's just not very good arguing. In my case: not a Star Wars fan. This was just not that good of a movie."
916,"Rian Johnson's ""Knives Out"" was a viewing pleasure. A solid mix of everything that makes movies great. The films humor was genuine, not cheap or in bad taste. Wonderful to see such a fantastic cast too! Genuinely great filmmaking with a stylized approach and complex storytelling. Now... If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go watch it again :)"
917,Great cast as always in these mysteries but very dull
918,"Is the heroine the real conspirator behind the scenes?
At the end of the balcony hostess end cup and the following family crowd look at each other, ironic.
The female host finally showed a smile when she looked at Hugh, and there was a possibility that she would become the final winner.
The heroine shook her legs many times, especially in the face of Harlan's portrait.
It seems that the symptom of lying and vomiting can also be self-controlled, which makes people guess whether she can guide the truth through this means.
In the film, the detective said that the dog knows the good and evil of people, and the heroine throws the clue away, the dog sends the clue to the detective again, which seems to be a metaphor."
919,Bravo movie is so awesome 👏 best crime investigation thriller
920,"I loved this movie , great actors showing their skills and a fantastic storyline to keep you entertained aswell as some comedy to keep it lighthearted. Would recommend!"
921,"Well here's my review of Knifes Out (2018 ) A large cast & what seems like a descent bubjet ! Think of it like a modern day Clue ! If you remember the 1985 film starring Tim Curry , Now back to Knifes Out a who dun it a wealthy working class family father has died but it seems with a lot of twist & turns regarding his death ! No spoiler as to who is it but as for the around 2 hrs . I got a little resetless watching at frist a bit to talky for my likeable but I watched it all in the end ! The vertict it's by far a brilant film just ok ! Really that's what l felt a ok film nothing to ride home about ! As for Jamie Lee Curtis & Toni Collette l felt they didn't have or get much to do in this film . Don Johnson also appears in this film & is fine in his role for what it's worth . Other actors role get larger in the later part of the movie ! We also have a young actor whom is the lead actor among actors who have been around for quite a while in TV & Film . She's does a ok job in the lead ....again you noted l am using the word more than once's ! Enough said thanks guys"
922,"All were brilliant though, but the real show stealer is our very own James Bond, Craig, loved everything from him! Chris Evans, too was damn good and so was Ana D with her innocence.
Reccomed to give this movie a try!"
923,"Don't get me wrong, Rian Johnson shamelessly deficated on Star Wars and for that, his work will forever be tainted. That being said, this was an incredibly fantastic film. I loved every minute of it. And I'm looking forward to watching it again."
924,Really expected a future classic movie. Instead it seemed like a waste of potential when you have such a impressive cast. And Daniel Craig come on! That southern accent was just ridiculous! Wasn't really a murder mystery either. But well ok it was watchable
925,"A fresh addition in mystery genre.great performance by daniel craig.Plot is engaging enough to keep you interesting with good character development,a little perdictable at times but overall a good movie if you are looking to watch with family."
926,"It was a very entertaining, warm movie. Time flies away with the help of the shooting technics and creative dialogues."
927,1) The blood on Marta's shoes could not have flown from across the room. If it did then there should have been blood stains all around the wall.2) Ransom could not have killed Fran since according to the movie it takes a short time for the excess morphine to kill. Ransom was with Marta for at least 30 minutes before the 10 AM meeting time when they were by the burned building.
928,I think if they shortened the story and cut some unnecessary parts the movie would've been really more interesting.
929,"Waste of time and energy. Predictable plot, poor acting."
930,"It's a movie that you need to be focus to understand what really happen, to know who is who, what are their true intensiones, is funny so is a movie that you can enjoy with your family and friends."
931,"Good start, mediocre middle, weak end.
Daniel Craig lacks charisma & the accent is distracting. I do not believe I shall ever watch again."
932,"Simple, good idea and very smooth. Great movie. It will remind you about all aspects movie should have."
933,"A funny, well written whodunit with great production design, costumes and amazing performances. Daniel Craig and his weird accent are the standouts. He made me laugh the most :)))
Plus, Ana de Armas is fantastic. Other standouts for me were Christopher Plummer, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis and of course Chris Evans ( and his sweater ). This is the type of movie Rian Johnson should make moving forward and I hope his career will take off big time. I'm excited for what he's gonna do next."
934,But the casting (and accent) of Daniel Craig is a total mismatch. All three detectives are blend and dont seem to fit in this very good movie. Even Captain America plays his part well.
935,I really liked the way it was shot and the plot was fun and exciting. I really liked it.
936,"Very good crime story, the characters are great and good turns !"
937,"The best thing about this movie was the captivatingly beautiful and deftly droll Ana de Armas, who steals the show amid a phlanx of stars. Then there's Daniel Craig doing a Hilarious Lionel Barrymore imitation as investigator Benoit Blanc. He leads an ensemble cast that includes Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Jamie Leigh Curits, Christopher Plummer, and Don Johnson, all ofwhom share a goofy approach to the material.
The only ewak spot of the filmis Chris Evans, who seems out of place as Ransom. I kept wanting to see James Franco, Evans just didn't register. Otherwise a good time."
938,"This is a must see movie. Daniel Craig, Jamie lee curtis, Toni collette and Ana De Armas put in notable performances. The movie plays like this:° Victim dies, Whodunit is Initiated° The Audience now get to play along as each of the suspects are interviewed by Daniel Craig° Each Individual in the Audience is putting things together to sum up who they think did it° This goes on for Awhile until the reveal finally happens° Even after the reveal, the plot gets deeper and deeper.Knives out kept me completely occupied with it throughout. My expectations were disrupted at every turn. I doubt many people figured it out beforehand and even then it wasn't over."
939,"I haven't seen a lot of who-dunnit movies in a while. However I gotta say that this was pleasantly enjoyable. I think that the first hour of the movie or so is a tad bit too slow. I get that it is supposed to be a mystery, but it feels like a slow drag. It definitely picks up at the end though. I enjoyed the acting, although the characters were quite basic, I'm giving it a pass as that is kind of a staple for films like this. I found Daniel Craig's accent to be a bit jarring at times, and I don't think it was polished quite as well as it could have been, but after hearing it for 15 minutes or so you get used to it. Chris Evans character was my favorite by far. Overall, a fun murder mystery film."
940,"Overall the cast did a phenomenal job acting out their characters. As with most detective/mystery movies, there are some twists and turns in the plot that will surprise the audience. One gripe with the movie is that the movie made it quite obvious who we, the viewers, are supposed to hate. The wealthy family was greedy, entitled, arrogant, conniving, and a whole host of other negative attributes, while Martha, the representative of the lower class, was warm, heartfelt, caring, and kind."
941,"What I feel is reverse, reverse and then reverse. Wonderful editing and performance! This film is not only a mix of British gentleman style and American background, but also clever settings and lens language."
942,"Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by a mystery person to investigate the death of well know crime writer Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Harlan was found dead on the night of his 85th birthday after celebrating with his close family. Now it's up to the detective to investigate and question Harlan's dysfunctional family to find the truth about his death.Knives Out is a film that gets going right at the start. I say this because at the beginning of this film, Harlan is already dead. As an audience, we gain an understanding of Harlan's death and the events leading up to it thanks to flashbacks from each of Harlan's family members during questioning. Speaking of Harlan's family members, there are many of them in this film and the actors all do an incredible job. Actors such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Chris Evans and Michael Shannon are just some of the great actors who play murder suspects.Watching the detective investigate and question each of the family members is easily one of the biggest and most entertaining elements to this film. Watching characters try to hide secrets or provide their version of the birthday dinner before Harlan's death is simply creative and interesting to watch.Another element I enjoyed was the overall mystery and plot. In movies today there has been a recent wave of murder mysteries but most of these have been remakes. Thankfully Knives Out (2019) is something new and fresh. I'm also surprised at how times I found this film funny as well as sometimes suspenseful because of the mystery and characters. The pacing and movie timeline was also different instead of being just another ""who done it"" tale.Visuals I also couldn't fault. Lots of clever filming styles are used here and there is constant and solid creativity from the director for both audio and visuals.Complaints? Very little actually. With a such a large cast, not all well-known actors share the screen time as much as our leads do (which is expected). Daniel Craig is fantastic, but I did find his accent here a little distracting at times. Other elements that didn't sit well with me requires me to give spoilers and I'm not doing that today.Overall, Knives Out is simply a film full of fun. It's humourous, but also a serious murder mystery. Characters are great and stunning to see on screen. The murder mystery itself is also satisfying, especially if you are seeking a fresh ""who done it"" murder mystery. Knives Out is new, it's fresh, it's great. 8.8/10 - Walkden Entertainment"
943,"Saying that Rian Johnson is a great film maker is understatement. It seems like he just understands all aspects of movie telling and presenting a story that will give him a great opportunity in future to make more movies like this and offer us a lot more enjoyment out of his work.Agatha Christie style of mystery wrapped with great sense of humor and stunningly strong cast will keep you seated for all times and make you to think and develop ideas while at the same time offering something new and fresh to follow and change pace, take turns and finally arrive with satisfying ending.A murder mystery that will turn out to be more than what catches the eye and make a great use of all main stars, giving them a decent time on screen to make all wonders and suck us into their lives.Rian's original idea and his modern approach to this modern day mystery with amazing production set and design that will make others look cheap and his brilliant idea of humor and comedy that blends fantastic into the plot of the movie and the one last and final riddle that feels like love letter to all murder-mystery films and tries to make it smarter.Cast of the movie is also unbelievable and we can only say that all of them offer something that makes it great and creating of modern detective in Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) into Poirot-esque character makes this movie one of the greats of 2019's. 3.5/4"
944,"This was worthy of Agatha Christie! {Usually, I figure these things out and really piss off my wife, early on. Not this time. I figured out the ""method"" but it took me quite a bit longer to figure out whodunnit.} The acting was on point. I thought Daniel Craig might come off as flaky with the southern accent but he pulled it off impeccably. All of the actors did right by their roles. No-one came off as cartoonish or caricatures of people. A film like this, truly, stands on it's writing. Bull's-eye! I don't feel like any of it will become ""dated"" and this is a mystery movie that will stand the test of time. Kudos to all involved.
Perhaps, we can look forward to a sequel involving the character of Benoit Blanc?"
945,"I never knew how much I needed to hear Daniel Craig talk in a southern accent. Him talking about donut holes inside of donuts was a much needed comic relief in such an entertaining movie. There were very few moments, that I could remember, that were slow; every scene I felt like something important was being said or done.
I was truly waiting for the twist when Harlan would jump out at the end and reveal that this was just another game to see who was worthy of this inheritance; but I like this ending better.
My favorite scene was the police chase when Ransom was telling Marta to step on it and it zooms in on the speedometer barely cracking 50 or 60 mph.
Overall, A great movie and very entertaining from start to finish."
946,"Watching the great!
Not a dead line, not a dead scene
Would it be better if it were a three-part miniseries? I've already figured out who to send the will at the end of the first episode and who sent the threat letter at the end of the second"
947,I loved it! I have been waiting for another Murder By Death with entertaining eccentric characters set in an old house. Watched it several times in the 48 hours I rented it. It's definitely a keeper!
948,"Although 2020 was loaded with great films, I believe ""Knives Out"" should've been a nomination for Best Film. I am not a fan of ""whodunnit"" films, but this cast was loaded from top to bottom. Instead of focusing primarily on the plot-twist, this film focuses heavily on character development. You will have fun during this movie, and answers are dispersed throughout so you aren't waiting til the very end for one giant twist. If you haven't seen this film yet, go see it. If you have, don't ruin it for everyone else."
949,"At some point I had my doubts but I ended up really liking this movie!The twists & turns kept coming, as did the one-liners. One of my favorites was CSI: KFC! Later there was a reference to Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn accent.Such a cast of talented actors, but they each took their moment to shine.Bravo!"
950,"""Knives Out"" has a simple premise, with loveable characters, hilarious dialogue and a thrilling storyline. The camera work is fabulous, and the design team did a fantastic job bringing the eccentric setting to life.However, there are certain aspects of this movie that could have made it even better:
1. My biggest issue with it was the use of the characters. The cast is among the most vivid and famous of recent films, and the roles they played were quite entertaining and promising. However, only a few of the characters gained a satisfying amount of screen-time.
2. The story would have worked better had the cast been used more. Only the detectives, Martha, Ramson and a couple more characters became truly relevant to the story; and it was ultimately the most explored suspect that was announced the killer.I do, however, think it's a brilliant movie. Everyone can find something to enjoy; the characters, the vivid setting or even the plot twists along the way. It's not the best film of the year, probably, but it's a good binge-watch for crime fiction lovers like myself."
951,"Knives Out plays out like a modern day whodunit, and who better than Rian Johnson at the helm. Brick was like an update of the tough Bogart era films, but here Johnson carves his own Agatha Christie storyline. The film is a twisted storyline with a strong cast. I was worried the film played its cards too early, but it still had enough to keep things fresh. Fingers crossed Johnson brings a sequel, or spin-off."
952,"A good movie with a good plot carries itself along entertainingly with a great cast led by top performances by renowned southern ""gumshoe"" Daniel Craig, and PD Lieutenant LaKeith Stanfield in particular and of course, Jamie-Lee Curtis."
953,A magnificent movie. The plot was wonderful and good acting too. Good mysteries and a wonderful cast as well. Standing ovation for that movie
954,"One of the best mystery movie ever made.
All the trivia envolved in this movie is spectacular!"
955,"Private Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by someone (he doesn't know who hired him) to solve the murder of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer)who just had his 85th Birthday. Blanc must sift through lies, mis-truths, and outright deception to discover the truth. The whole family is assembled for the investigation by Blanc to determine who killed Harlan, but most are concerned how much they will get when the WILL is read.This is a loooong movie but it goes by so fast you don't really notice. And get this: when the Lawyer Frank Oz (Alan Stevens) reads the WILL, it is here a whole new story starts and you don' mind one bit because now it really gets interesting. You'll see.I got a kick out of Daniel Craig's Southern Accent. Finally we see some good acting by the one who plays Bond, James Bond, and he did great. I thoroughly enjoyed it.Twist? You want a twist? You got it. There are a couple and no you won't see them coming. No one did. You know how Harlan Thrombey dies, but Det Benoit Blanc needs to figure out all the steps involved, which reminded me of the old Charlie Chan (or Agatha Christi) movies back in the day, but here there is no number 1, or 2 son to rely on/ blame for not recognizing clues. Just a thought.The key to everything is Marta, Harlan's nurse, played by the most beautiful Ana de Armas. You will know what she knows, but there is much more to know that she doesn't know. You'll see. Oh, the one thing about Marta that you will come to know early: when she doesn't tell the truth, she vomits.Notables: Jamie Lee Curtis as Linda Drysdale, Thrombey's daughter; Don Johnson as Richard, husband of Linda; Michael Shannon as Walt Thronbey, son of Harlan, but who also runs Harlan's publishing company; Chris Evans as Richard's son Ranson who knows he was cut out of the WILL; Toni Collette as Joni daughter of Harlan; LaKeith Stanfeld as Lieutenant Elliott; K. Callan as Greatnana Wanetta, Harlan's mother; M. Emmet Walsh as Mr Proofec, Thrombey's head of Security.This is a very satisfying movie and when it does end, you will wish it didn't. You'll see. (9/10)Violence: Yes, not much though.
Sex: No.
Nudity: No.
Humor: Yes, at times.
Language: Yes, but not much.
Ratiing; A"
956,"I just this second finished watching this, and I have to say, 'This is a Great Movie'. It's been ages since I saw a truly great mystery, who dunnit, detective story. I'd say, this is one of the greats films of that genre. It really captures that Poirot (Peter Ustinov) or Miss Marple (Margaret Rutherford) type of atmosphere. It has a very similar visual style, as well as, a similar sense of humor. But then amp it up about 50 time (lol). Anyways,this film is basically great.I really liked all the characters. I liked the family and all their interpersonal dramas and bickering. (Once again this reminds me Mrs. Marple or Poirot or Poirot.) It's always good to see Jamie Lee Curtis. She just keeps getting better and better with age. The other actors were unfamiliar to me. But they were all very good.The detective in this one (Detective Benoit Blanc) is also unfamiliar to me. I don't know if this is based on a book or what. Anyways, they should turn this into a franchise. The adventures of Detective Blanc. He is quirky, funny, and all knowing, just like those other greats I mentioned before. (Though I have to admit I wasn't sure if he knew anything until the very end.)The twists in this. OMG! So many twists' in ways I never expected, or saw coming. This movie does a really good job of amping up the mystery genre. There's even a bit of over the top action. But, it's done really well. Really though, it's the twists, and the mystery, that is tweaked out, and amped up, more than the typical mysteries, of the past.Final Verdict: I strongly recommend it to fans of mysteries, who dunnits, old dark house, etc.."
957,"From opening to the credits, it captures you! It's like a modern homage to Clue with witty twists and turns. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen in a while!"
958,"First of all, all trailers for this movie, they don't do justice to it. From them you can say it's your average Sunday movie but it isn't.
Let's say, in the first 30 minutes in, you have the impression that is some kind of Murder on the Orient Express scenario. After some more watching, I got the impression that is a combination of Murder on the Orient Express and Cluedo board game.A highly entertaining title. You do not have time to get bored. Although this title has his funny moments in my opinion the most funny thing in the whole movie was Daniel Craig's accent."
959,"The plot was predictable for me as a fan of old detective books (poirot, holmes etc.), it wasn't that hard to understand who was the real killer around the middle of the movie. But these are not really the worst sides. Movie treats you like you are a 10 year old kiddo i mean it doesn't even try to make you think instead the main ""cliche"" detective explains everything in the end. It was an easy and fun to watch movie overall but definitely not an 8. Like cmon go and see inherent vice or memories of murder"
960,"Fantastic writing and cast, I definitely did not expect Daniel Craig's character to have a French name and a Southern drawl. The dialogue was witty and funny and I was so wrong about the murder, which is always a great thing because it means the movie isn't predictable."
961,"I really enjoyed the movie for what it was. The house was the perfect setting for that classic ""Clue"" vibe. The movie never took itself too serious and they kept it light all the way through. It was paced really well and kept me engaged the entire time.I enjoyed how the story was somewhat solvable if you paid enough attention - I feel like not many mystery movies allow the viewer to actually figure out the mystery.All star cast made it extra enjoyable to watch."
962,"Not too bad not perfect but definitely worth watching.Great Cast, The plot is very well written and the cinematography really pretty.
7/10 for me. Go watch It!! Nice Try Rian Johnson..."
963,This will be my shortest review in simple terms. A quirky whodunnit story in a mansion with an entire family each having their own motives. It gives and takes what the story wants you to think to come around to a sweet ending. Just see it if this kind of stuff appeals as it is done quite well. As for Daniel Craig's performance....it's ridiculously tasty.
964,"I like the plot twists, the cinematography, the actors' (acting), the costumes and the background of place and culture of this movie. Good entertainment I could say.
However something alas about it is several story details seem irrelevant in real life, particularly on how smooth was the plan executed as expected like when Marta just right away read the blackmail letter between the mixed up mails she received."
965,"Is there to be a return to classic murder, ""whodunit"" films? Director Rian Johnson believes so with his latest, Knives Out. In the runtime of 131 minutes, the plot progressively thickened and had as many twists as a Twizzler. Following the death of the wealthy Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), grandfather of the affluent Thrombey family, a private detective is hired to investigate the possibility of murder. All of the family members were present the night of Harlan's death, so each is investigated to find the guilty. Beyond the rather basic plot of a detective solving a crime, complicated and modern themes are incorporated to add significant depth.In many regards, Knives Out follows an overall simple plot of a detective working to solve a murder. However, in detail, it strays from standard practice which supports and hurts the film. A classic ""whodunit"" mystery, such as Clue (1985), follows a group of characters working to discover who the murderer is among themselves. The guilty person, or people, are usually not revealed until the end to keep the viewer guessing and involved. The person who killed Harlan Thrombey was revealed within the first quarter of the two-hour-long film. This unanticipated event changed the plot and point of view of the mystery for the better and worse. Instead of the whole cast being of equal importance, the plot stuck to a limited group of characters, and it was rather easy to tell who the guilty were. This somewhat worked for the film as it was able to bring in different and complicated motifs, such as loyalty, family, and new versus old in unique and unexpected perspectives.The development was superb for both the lead and supporting characters, but there was missed potential by not using the complete cast to its fullest. The lead private detective, Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, brought life and humor along with the impressions of expertise. He shared many qualities with Sherlock Holmes, only Blanc is ironically a southerner and Daniel Craig is British. Benoit teams with Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), a young woman who works at Harlan's house as part of the help, to search the estate for clues of a murder. Blanc thinks he can trust her because every time Marta tells a lie, she throws up. These two characters, along with the disliked and arrogant Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), grandson to Harlan, are primarily the lead characters in the plot. Although they were excellently played and intriguing to watch, the remaining cast of around ten was rather only for support. This was disappointing as they all were beautifully developed and had depth, such as the two teenage grandchildren who both had extreme but opposite political views. This was especially true with Harlan's children and in-laws, who all had complex perspectives and motives, from Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon) who aimed to take over his father's production company but was fired instead, to Richard Drysdale (Don Johnson) who was cheating on his wife, Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis). As previously discussed, if the film was more similar to that of Clue, more of the fascinating characters would have been involved and the film would have even more depth.What kept this movie going was the beautifully designed characters and the excellence in their portrayal by the actors. Also, the dialogue was current and felt real to modern-day issues, the cinematography illustrated the beauty of the setting and created tension, and the strong motifs helped incorporate depth. The only negative was the somewhat see-through plot, which is essential in a mystery. Although it was unique, it was disappointing to not see the cast be used to the fullest."
966,"I don't really care for Rian Johnson after The Last Jedi. But this is a well-crafted story. There are a couple minor plot holes/questions. It's like if Agatha Christie was a painter, and Johnson created a passable forgery. Ana de Armas is in the infant stages of her stardom, Daniel Craig has embodied a character (albeit with a questionable US southeastern coastal accent) that can potentially launch a sequel/franchise, and Chris Evans got the chance to demonize a ""non-woke"" caricature of priveledged, white America. The politicical/ethnic aspects of the story weren't necessary. It moves the plot minimally. But, great cast. Good story."
967,"Switch Don Johnson and Daniel Craig and you'd have a movie that would fare much better in suspending your disbelief. As a Canadian living in Austria all my European friends liked the movie because 1) the current iteration of James Bond is idolized more here than in North America, and 2) they wouldn't know a terrible southern accent if it hit them in the face. I couldn't get into the movie listening to a Brit making a mess of a regional American accent. The movie overall was good fun, but no better than 7.5/10. I'm being nice when I knock off only 1.5 for the miscasting. Kevin Spacey or a long list of other good American actors could have done better. Attempting to keep the 'Poirot' suave sophistication and British sensibility while playing a poor southern American accent was a mistake by casting and the producers who I'm assuming put star power over believability. The other acters were also underused. Worth a look but nothing special."
968,"The acting, the script, the camerawork in this movie is amazing. The tension and comedy are great but I had problems with the characters. The side characters weren't developed enough for me to think that one of them had done it. There were only two characters who could have done it and one of the options is not even an option after 50 minutes. I liked the cause of murder, how it played out and how it was written but I was disappointed of its mystery. The guilty person was clear but his intention was unclear. If this movie could have surprised me with an understandable cause then it would have been a masterpiece. The movie is great and it is wonderful if you don't think about whoddunit and think about how did he do it, it will be way more enjoyable and mysterious"
969,"I was grown up with Poirot and Miss Marple so maybe that is why i thought it was predictible, but in the other case it was REALLY GOOD AND FUN!!!"
970,"KNIVES OUT was one of the films I had circled on my calendar as a ""must see"". It seemed to be a perfect antidote to the CGI-Fest films that are very prevalent in the multi-plex today. So...when life got in the way and I couldn't get to this film for about a month, I tried (and succeeded) in not getting this movie spoiled for me in my various Social Media feeds.And I'm glad I went to such lengths, for I found KNIVES OUT to be a truly original and entertaining film that kept me guessing throughout the length of the film - right up to the ""big reveal.""So...if you haven't seen this film...stop reading this now...go see it...and come back.Still here (or are you back)? Okay...let's continue...Directed by Rian Johnson (known by many as the Director of THE LAST JEDI, but I think this movie owes more of it's heritage to his breakthrough film BRICK or his Sci-Fi action flick, LOOPER), KNIVES OUT is an old-fashioned, Agatha Christie-type murder mystery complete with an oddball Detective trying to figure out ""whodunnit"" that features an All-Star cast of suspects as well as an Oscar winning murder victim.As I stated above, Johnson has traversed a murder mystery-type film before in his neo-noir homage BRICK, but in this film he really let's his wings fly as he plays, marvelously, with the drawing room murder mystery pastiche. Johnson wrote and directed this film and the twists and turns and originality of his vision is apparent on screen, playing with expectations without being too clever.He has assembled an All-Star cast of actors playing interesting characters. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Toni Colette, Don Johnson and Jacob Trombley all bring star power and charisma to their roles and each one COULD have been the murderer. As often happens in these types of films, each one gets A scene to shine, but only the one ""whodunnit"" really gets to step out.As the Law Enforcement on their trail, Lakeith Stanfield (GET OUT) and Noah Segan (LOOPER) play off each other well and they play off of Daniel Craig (James Bond, of course) very well. Craig plays Private Detective Benoit Blanc with some sort of Cajun-type accent that works more than it doesn't, I enjoyed his performance enough to find it charming and not annoying.Special notice needs to be made of the performances of Christopher Plummer - as the murder victim (I'm not spoiling anything here, it's in the trailer) and Frank Oz (the famous Muppeteer and Director). Both are ""old pros"" who bring a grounding to the proceedings. Their performances are almost down to earth commentaries on the other characters/performances and they both helped out this film tremendously.Finally, the film revolves around the journey that Ana de Armas' character, Maria Cabrera, is on in this film. She is the audience's eyes and ears into this story, having clues and plot points revealed to her as we, the audience, have them revealed to us. I fell in love with de Armas when she played Joi in BLADE RUNNER: 2049 and she is pleasant enough company here to search out this mystery with.With all these pieces - and characters - to put together and move around, I did find that this film suffered a bit by ""too much"" and ""too fast"" at times that caused me not to care about certain people and circumstances (especially at the beginning), but that was quickly forgotten/forgiven as the film progressed and I was engrossed in the mystery - a mystery that I did not know how it was going to end.And that, is unique and rare enough for me.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
971,"This 2019 comedy thriller stars Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas and Christopher Plummer. Plummer plays Harlan, a wealthy, old man who is found dead in his home which appears to be suicide. His trusted nurse, Marta (de Armas) finds herself part of an investigation along with his obnoxious family ran by detective, Blanc (Craig) who believes that he was murdered. Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and Michael Shannon are also featured. This is a good comedy mystery similar to ""Clue"" with a great cast
and funny moments I recommend."
972,"Damn if I see a good movie I can not stop feeling it under my skin. Star Wars put me on movie eater category, and I love to say Knives Out is a damn great suspans detective movie with dark comedy ridding on it!!! Enjoy!"
973,"I thought I was done with this type of murder mystery/who did it movie. Still it was very fun to watch, with an excellent cast and an excellent setting, Knives Out proved me wrong when I thought I've seen just about every twist for this type of movie. Plot kept getting better and better, what a relief!"
974,"I love classic whodunnit movies. This is not a classic whodunnit movie. About halfway through the movie they revealed whodunnit. Then throw in a stupid twist in the end for no reason.
It's also hard to get over Daniel Craig's southern accent."
975,"Whilst not the biggest fan of Ana De Armas, i will say this was an enjoyable yet long movie experience, could have done with a major time edit but all in all good fun and great performances by some true legends of the silver screen!"
976,"It was entertaining enough I suppose, but when a film has 10/10 reviews from critics and fans alike, you have expectations which the movie simply did not deliver on. I paid close attention and still found myself confused at several points in the story. There are far better movies in this genre, for example, I personally enjoyed this years Ready Or Not much more in the Murder Mystery Mansion Movie genre."
977,I loved the story. Daniel Craig was awesome. I recommend everyone to see this movie! It was a real pleasure
978,"Just watched this in cinema. All I can say is that the film was meh..The acting was amazing. The script good. But over all... meh.
3/4 of the way through I wanted to go home. It wasnt anything special. I would watch it at home. But paying £15 in cinema for it... I regret it."
979,"I've missed movies like Knives Out. This old-fashioned whodunnit isn't remarkably clever or witty, but it manages to present a variety of interesting characters/suspects in a way that feels familiar, yet keeps you guessing. I do wonder about rewatchability, though. Now the mystery has been unraveled, I doubt this movie would be as entertaining upon subsequent viewings."
980,"Well it looked very willing but it didn't shine. It's just average,medium level film. Plot looked interesting and funny (from the trailer) but it was like 1/10 of whole movie. Was it worth money for the ticket? I believe not."
981,"A great cast with an okay script, Ana de Armas proves to be one of the best actresses in this times and Daniel Craig delivers a fun character all the way, but overall, nothing else apart from that. Will not remeber it."
982,"Knives Out is one of 2019's brightest original concept. It is a charming take on the Mystery genre. Knives Out is written and directed by Rian Johnson, and it portrays an All-Star cast of characters as a family fighting for inheritance in leu of a tragedy. The film stars Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, and Christopher Plumber as the Thrombey Family. Despite being centered around the Thrombey family and their tragedy, the film's protagonist is Marta portrayed by Ana De Armas. The best performance in the film comes from Daniel Craig's portrayal of Detective Benoit Blanc. Craig does an exceptional portraying a southern detective. His southern accent and intense body language present the film with a sense of levity. Most of the cast (with an exception of a few) have great chemistry and they make the film superb. The best part of this film is the acting, whereas the worst part comes from the writing.Rian Johnson wrote the film and for the most part, his writing was not bad. However, in typical Rian Johnson fashion, his writing is very incohesive and inconsistent. The first half of this film serves as a daunting mystery with thrilling dialogue. The setup is incredible and is some of the best writing in 2019. Midway into the second act, the film loses its footing and becomes a family comedy. The first half of the film is squandered by a premature reveal that ultimately hurts the story. Essentially, the Knives Out story has no rhythm or flow. This lack of cohesion trickles down into the characters as well. Daniel Craig's Detective Benoit Blanc goes from the World's Smartest Detective to the World's Most Oblivious Private Eye. Furthermore, Characters such as Trooper Wagner (played by Noah Segan) water down the film with corny one liners of obscure or outdated Pop Culture references. The comedy in this film fluctuates from natural to corny. The conclusion of the film is unsatisfying as well, because it feels more like a reach than an actually well-thought out ending. The conclusion is borderline parody, because it makes no sense for the most part how the characters came to find out the nature of the true mystery. There are minor hints throughout the film, however using things such as Hallmark movies as a clue is very stupid. The writing was very incohesive and could have benefitted from more guidance.Despite the poor writing, the film is thematically sound. The sociopolitical undertones of the film are well done. However, the dialogue toward immigration fluctuates between respectful and ignorant. The cinematography was great. The film was well-lit and finely produced. The digital cameras were great for this film. The set piece of Harlan Thrombey's estate was really intricate. The estate is great to look at, and it's akin to the estate in 1958's ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"". The audio quality and editing were fine. The compilation of flashbacks was refreshing.Overall, Knives Out is one of 2019's best original story that was squandered by Rian Johnson's poor writing and corny humor. The film excels in acting and thematic storytelling, serving as a decent film with some of 2019's best casting."
983,"Good film that I was drawn to because of the cast and plot. I love whodunit films and anything that has a twist. Unfortunately, I knew the twist about 60% into the film. I'd still recommend it to any fans of the genre. The comedy was decent. Daniel Craig was amazing!"
984,"If you are suspicious of high ratings these days as I am, go see my ratings, I do not praise a movie easly. This is perhaps the best movie of the year. Its horizon is extremely narrow, it's just a whodunnit with a hint of immigration themes, but it's perfectly executed. It's grotesque, with a couple of funny moments and tongue in cheek humor. Flawless acting by a great cast, beautifully directed in this over-the-top story. Lots of twists. Utterly satisfying."
985,"I went to see this film not knowing anything about it.
And I enjoyed this film in the sense that it is the sort of film the cinema desperately needs these days. There are no flashy visuals, no spectacles, or extraordinary premises. It's purely about the stories and the characters, through which this film shines.
Overall, it's a competently directed film with solid storytelling, great production value, and an amazing cast.
All the twists and turns are not necessarily mind-boggling but certainly interesting enough to warrant a potential second viewing."
986,For me the end was plot twisting but felt extremely anticlimactic as I would expect out of a mystery movie. 6/10 stars
987,"Loved how the movie was built without escalating things too quickly, the actors really played their roles and were in character"
988,"Knives out is a murder mystery which is better than the average murder mystery.For a start the cast list of Knives Out is excellent. This includes Daniel Craig as Benoit Blank who is hired to investigate the murder of the rich patriarch Harlon Thrombey played by the great Christopher Plummer. As you watch the movie you come up with your own ideas of who is behind the murder. I guyess some of my ideas were right and some were wrong, but the clues are all in the movie if you are clever enough to pick them up.An enjoyable watch although the movie probably will not lose much when it is shown on the small screen."
989,"Really enjoyable, if slightly overpraised (at the moment) for my money, murder mystery from Rian Johnson.Acclaimed author Harlan Thromby (Christopher Plummer) dies on the night of his birthday party at his stately home. Though seemingly suicide, the celebrated amateur detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) believes it may be something more sinister - particularly when he learns that Thromby has recently been putting his estate in order, which would prove costly for his lazy ruthless trust-fund family.There's an awful lot to like about ""Knives Out"". It's an all-star cast, and the performances generally live up to that billing; even if, rather by the necessity of time, some of them don't feature very much. The script is also very funny, with several laugh out loud lines - though I wouldn't go as far as calling ""Knives Out"" a comedy and definitely not a parody of a ""whodunit"". I do like to see a murder mystery on the big screen again, as a genre it's rather fallen out of favour, or been resigned to the television - I don't think we've had a big screen one since ""Murder on the Orient Express"". Once you get used to Daniel Craig's accent, it's easier to warm to the character (in fact I'd like to see another Benoit Blanc mystery at some point in the future).One criticism is true of the genre, rather than specifically this film. Given that I now know what happened that night, I don't think I'm going to need to see the film again any time soon, if ever. There isn't much replay value to it.Specific to this film though, at its conclusion I felt like I wanted more. There are a number of twists, but they revolve around the characters that we're left with and I think I'd have preferred a cleverer version that involved a few more of the rest of the family in some capacity. I do accept that this is a delicate balancing act though, and too many twists for the sake of it might have driven the film into farce.That said, for the two hours you're in the cinema with ""Knives Out"" it's a great time."
990,"The story is too simple that the first moment of the important clue (medicine bottle) show up, and I got the answer. It is a little bit upset, since my expectations is a more complicated story with complicated characters relationships as Murder on the Orient Express"
991,"What a great first half of a film a star studded line up and i loved all the setting up of what could of been a cool whodunnit .....? But then it just got messy and lost its way and over complicated the whole film , at the end i just felt frustrated that the second half failed to be as cool as the first ....... Meh 6/10 .....!!!!!"
992,Kept me on the edge of my seat during the 130minutes. Full of suspens and twists
993,"Truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was only worth one star, IMO, but I gave it two because I could not stop laughing at how bad it was. Many have compared it favourably to the great mystery novels for some reason. Agatha Christie was clever, the writer of this was pretty dim. I guess he/she did not have to bother, since the cast was so good the movie was bound to do well at the box office.And, why did Daniel Craig even try an American accent? It seems that many British actors do a pretty good job, but Daniel is not one of them."
994,"Morally, zero points would be indicated, but because of the good performers, two points. The story itself could have been good if it wasn't just another piece of racist Hollywood political propaganda. Attention please: the following text contains spoilers (I'm trying to keep it blurry, but don't read anyone who hasn't seen the film yet): Martha, the Latina saint - was unsympathetic to me from the start (and not because she is Latina, but because of her dishonorable actions), and I am sticking to it. She believes that she is to blame for the death of someone who has been entrusted to her and who appreciates her - and what is the ""good-hearted"", ""innocent"" Martha doing with her cross on the car mirror and (whether the practice is approved or not, but fact :) illegally immigrated family? She greedily and without the slightest sense of guilt robs the whole inheritance from a foreign (in the sense of not her) family, instead of, if she had a little conscience, renouncing it. Ransom is really not a popular figure either, but he's absolutely right when he says she was accepted into the family and that's how she thanks it. Let's stay with the facts: She is not an outcast illegitimate granddaughter, she is an employee, and so she does not have to be treated particularly nicely / familiar, and what was seen she was at least treated absolutely fairly, therefore she is truly not entitled to any more ""appreciation"". And her greed and manipulation and criminal energy show also in the chase that she causes with the police. She is not an innocent lamb, not a popular figure, she is the perfect example of a manipulative, greedy-aggressive, dishonorable gold digger (and if it speaks for her that she does not stand by and watch another person die in front of her eyes, that is very little, particularly because ... but I don't want to spoil anything more clearly) and I find it impossible for Hollywood to develop someone like this into a hero / winner - that shows where there is actually a lack of fairness and decency. And whoever thinks: it is only fiction anyway: I know such people in real life and they work / manipulate exactly like that and rob others of what THOSE are actually entitled to. In my eyes: Disgusting."
995,"The first time I watched this, I said to myself, ""what the he!! did I just watch?""I have since watched it several more times and have realized that this is a movie version of a madrigal song. Multiple stories are playing out at the same time, and they do not necessarily rely on each other. And yet, at the end, it all comes together!Excellent!"
996,"Very entertaining movie if you can play dumb with it, and act like it doesn't hold your hands throughout.The smartest part about the movie is the donut monologue, which says a lot, you'll know what I mean when you see it..."
997,"It starts off almost as a Poirot type comedy whodunit, but evolves into a dark well executed murder mystery with so many plot twists, it keeps you on your toes even when you think it's all over. Stellar star cast in whole new avatars, great acting and screenplay.
It's a must watch. I don't know how I missed it, but I came across it on an OTT platform."
998,"I saw this about three months ago, and I still think about how much I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It's beautifully shot, written, acted and edited. One of my favorites from the last few years."
999,"One of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The plot unravels in a brilliant way, gets your attention and doesn't let you get bored. I totally recommend it."
1000,Few movies truly leave me stumped and in awe. Knives Out gave me both in multitude. Every moment was a twist and turn that concluded in a jaw dropping revelation.
1001,"It has twists. Many twists. And that is what makes me hard to not keep watching. The plot is excellent. Music accompanies scenes well. A good life lesson was delivered. Overall, very entertaining."
1002,"I love movies. LOVE them. I use to go to movies once a week. Even more. But lately, movies are either sequels, prequels, remakes, tv shows, comic books. Movies that just don't have any substance. I thought knives out looked great from the preview, but frankly, I wasn't hopeful when I started it. I wasn't expecting to love it as much as I did!
Not only do you have great actors, great characters, humor that actually makes you lol, beautiful scenery, but you have a completely unique and interesting story line.
It amazes me that no one can find original ideas for movies now a days. Tv shows are becoming more creative and better. But knives out is a movie you can count on to entertain and amaze everyone in the room."
1003,"I had the privilege to see Knives Out in theaters when it first opened, and settled down for a rewatch on Prime Video over the weekend. The storyline, characters, and acting are all top-notch, but I have to say that because I was more familiar with the plot this time, during the second viewing time I was mesmerized by the set design and costumes. The attention to detail is superb and adds so much nuance to the storyline. And you just can't beat that last shot, a full 360 from the opening scene. Must watch!"
1004,Perfect scenario. I enjoyed every moment of this lovely film.
1005,"In making a funny yet somewhat serious version of an Agatha Christie inspired murder mystery film out of a classic choose your adventure book; director and writer Rian Johnson might have saved his career after the disappointment of 2017 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi'. This current day 'whodunit' tells the story of detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) having to investigate a rich patriarch Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) death after his family gathering has gone awry. Without spoiling the movie too much, the look of the rural manor completed with its trick window and kitsch 'memento mori' props really do seem like a real-life Clue board. While the huge cast of unique characters that live there might be hard to keep track for certain people. The mystery was still mostly well told through them. The acting is mostly top notch, even if some of the accents were kinda cartoony jarring like the valley girl talk and the deep southern drawl. After all, performers like Craig can make a donut speech sound ridiculous yet sweet & compelling at the same time. You get a lot of interesting hints that Blanc knows more than what he is putting out there. After all, the game is afoot. There is also a lot of foreshadowing within the dialogue. Yet the twist and turns were delivered so shape that it was enough to put doubt in the audience members to second guess themselves in what was somewhat of a real predictable murder mystery outcome. I kinda like the 'Rashomon' flashback style editing. To add onto that, the way every one of the family was framed in the corner of a circler knives decoration while being interview by the police; signifies their wiliness to reach out to stab one another. It was a clever subtle way to show that each member is trying to do any means in order to inherited the estate. The family even try to act like they were the ones that treat Harlen's nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) as a close friend, yet most of them have no clue about her. I like how their body language expose their true colors subtlety regardless of their political views. They all wolves in sheep's clothing. In this case, thin wool sweaters. For example, one of them hands her his empty plate as if she was the help; while talking about the problems of the American immigration system without consorting her about the tense topic. The kin's basic indifference toward her is clearly evident in the later visuals as only Blanc and Marta were allowed to be framed center of the donut shape blade ornament. It's metaphoric shows how nearly all the characters have turned their attention toward them. With all the daggers facing toward the detective and the nurse. They have become the target. Another visual example of that is the scene where the camera goes from Steadicam movement to chaotic hand held with all the family ganging up on Marta. You really do feel the stressful pressure of the outside world caving in on her. Ana gave a really good emotionally devastating performance here. Yet there were some semi sinister oddities within her supposing good hearted character. One such example is her bizarre nursing practice. Even if you take away the vial mix up. The amount of ketorolac dosage she gives Harlan is supposed to be 60 mg and given more than a few days. Yet Marta gives him an irresponsibly large dose of 100 mg per day. Why is she risking him with renal failure? That's clearly a red flag. Call it inaccuracy, but it seems like earlier drafts might had Marta more in the grey area than the angelic status. That's not the only thing that doesn't make sense. If Harlan really wanted to make sure that his nurse wouldn't get in trouble. Why then, he doesn't commit suicide somewhere people can see him? After all, 911 was already dial. Even half a ring, the dispatcher would probably call back to make sure it's a medical emergency. People in the house would know sooner than later that something isn't right. His plan seemed very stupid as he created the very scenario he'd intended to avoid. Meanwhile, the motives of the real killer overly complicated murder scheme also seemed entirely counterproductive as staging a murder isn't really needed. One thing that the slayer rule doesn't do is negate a will or bring a defunct one back. Even if it did work, then Massachusetts would treat it as no will. Causing the assets to pass to Harlan's children. The individual would still be disinheritance. The only true way to fight it would prove omitted child statute; which means unless the family member is expressly disinherited in the will, or it can be proved that their omission wasn't an accident, that individual might then receive a portion of the probated estate. Seeing that Harlan appears to have simply drawn up the will himself and given it to his lawyer in a sealed envelope means it was not properly witnessed and could be easily legitimate challenged in court as the letter doesn't meet the standard of a codicil note. All the attempted murderer really had to do is look for legit loopholes after the funeral. Yet that person further ruin it by going back to the crime site and being spot. The antagonist only got lucky that the individual saw themselves too literally as the defender of the estate not to call the cops. Nevertheless, some of the events involving that seem a little too convenience. Yet it didn't take me out of the movie too much. The music by composer Nathan Johnson mostly kept me aboard. Even pop songs like Gordon Lightfoot's ""Sundown"" were well used. Overall: Unlike the 1973 novel 'Gravity's Rainbow' by Thomas Pynchon that Blanc mention. This movie is worth checking out. It's not all turgid & overwritten. It's mostly shaped like a knife. Worth a slice."
1006,"I really enjoyed this film. It is full of style and interesting character building. The plot is fantastically written in and presented in an interesting way that separates it from the average whodunnit. In many ways it is classic whodunnit and also very forward-thinking.Under the surface the film is much more than fun, it is packed full of two-pronged dialog that pushes the story forward and deeply characterizes the individuals who make the plot that much better. The story simultaneously reveals who the characters are and presents a metaphor of them.In conclusion I recommend this film to people who just want to sit back and enjoy and movie buffs who are looking for some great story telling. It doesn't take itself too seriously at the same time as it displays the filmmakers deep love and respect for the art form and the genre. A fantastic combination, much like Inception, Kingsman, and many other films that combine fun, style and storytelling technique."

1008,"Entertaining and unexpected plot setup but the villain is way too predictable from 2/3rds into the movie. Characters are all tropes, and so it seems writers didn't even bother with character development. Which is a shame because the cast was talented. Daniel Craig is fine acting wise, except the accent. It sounds like an impression of Kevin Spacey's accent in House of Cards. Particularly Jamie Lee Curtis was underused, as was Don Johnson.Nonetheless an easy evening watching the film is not wasted, enjoyable cast (weak characters not withstanding)."
1009,"I am exhausted with confusing thriller and mystery movies, but thanks to Knives Out I take a deep breath.
Everything about that movie is so simple. No details hard to catch, no exaggerated acting, no Hitchcockian plans or Nolan's intelligence.. But this movie contains one of them little by little. I'm trying to explain with my terrible English is: Knives Out is a funny and a good job."
1010,Go in with an open mind and you will enjoy this larger than life whodunnit with great characters and performances. Daniel Craig plays a super smart modern day Poirot. Enjoy the plot twists and colourful characters.
1011,"I wasn't expecting too much going in to the movie but it was a great mystery movie. I don't want to say too much about it since it's a mystery film but I thought the acting was great, the story plausible and I don't know what else you want from a movie. It was fairly original for a whodunnit kind of thing. More of this please Hollywood."
1012,Lots of twists and turns. A very arty movie. Awesome characters. Great to watch
1013,"I really enjoyed this movie.
Daniel Craig channeled Frank Underwood but somehow with style. I am very sensitive to Hollywood's preponderance for portraying all southerners as simple peckerwoods. But it was well written, acted, directed with twists and everything.
Good Job Hollywood! For once!
Thanks for not preaching!"
1014,An interesting plot for those who are keen on detective stories. And good acting also! I've spent a very good time watching it and definitely will watch it once again in 2-3 years.
1015,"Overall - the story was engaging, with great acting, cinematography & script (good use of humour). Really enjoyable. Only a couple of things that would have made it better for me:1. They should have either let Daniel Craig use his normal accent, or used an American actor. The accent was grating - especially as he's a main character.2. Potentially unpopular opinion - but I would have liked to see a stronger case for the main suspects (to throw us off the trail). To explain, there was plenty of motive amongst them, but minimal 'evidence' to convince us they were involved. Therefore - when the perpetrator came to light at the end, whilst I didn't expect it, I wasn't particularly shocked / surprised.But overall, there's enough to keep us thinking & intrigued. Would like to see a sequel, or another murder mystery in the same format."
1016,I really enjoyed this. It was a good clean movie full of great acting and a fun plot. Would love to see a sequel
1017,"Strangely enjoyable for the type of film I don't normally enjoy, the whodunnit. Daniel Craig as an American is quite convincing. One of the characters refers to him as foghorn leghorn which was funny"
1018,"After a slow start knives out turned out to be a winner!The cast are all great and the mystery deepens until the truth is finally revealed in a beautiful parody of Agatha's typical style.I rarely found this film laugh out loud funny, but it was humourous throughout and beautifully put together to both parody and pay homage to the classic mystery movies at the same time!Well worth a watch 8/10"
1019,"A movie that will keep you sit tight. Wonderful movie driven by Daniel's mind blowing acting and superb plot . It's all about reveling the real reason of the death of a famous writer, and that's where the roller coaster ride starts. How did Harlene die, who is behind it, who is gaining the most, who is getting the assets after Harlene, are some questions which goes in the movie.
It almost goes slow as snail for initial part . But once we are halfway down, the ride gets some real speed and dives magnificently before bringing the real truth. To be frank, you think the secret was revealed by half way down, I bet there is something else coming once everything is revealed at a later part."
1020,"Not a perfect film, but still wonderful! A wealthy man appears to be murdered and a feeding frenzy of sharks ensues. Everyone has a motive, everyone is a suspect. At some points in the film you are sure what has happened, and then a new twist is revealed. All in all a very solidly plotted thriller/mystery packed full of endearing moments and plenty of dark humor."
1021,Agatha Christie is certainly what comes to people's minds when watching this movie but this movie has its own strides to it. Rian Johnson did an amazing on this despite having a major backlash on The Last Jedi. The writing on the characters plays a major role in making the story progress which makes the story works.
1022,"Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is a successful mystery novelist. He has invited his dysfunctional extended family to his Massachusetts mansion for his 85th birthday party. The following day, an unexpected death is discovered and eccentric detective Benoit Blanc (David Craig) shows up unexpectedly to see if there is any foul play involved in the death.Director/writer Rian Johnson begins the film with sharp editing (by Bob Ducsay) as the viewer sees interrogations with family members interspersed with events as they actually unfolded - events that are not revealed during the interrogations. This gets the film off to a great start and luckily, the energy stays that way.""Knives Out"" may be a bit long and somewhat convoluted with minor holes but it still provides a solid mystery with great twists and revelations as more and more is unfolded - especially the surprise ending. Adding to the mystery is whether or not a murder even took place. Its all-star cast provides fine performances especially from Craig, Ana de Armas as Harlan's likeable private nurse and confidante, and Chris Evans as Harlan's high-adrenaline, spoiled, entitled grandson. The film also goes deeper on many issues - including contemporary politics - and pulls no punches on what it has to say about trust-fund brats and lecherous in-laws.Other cast members include Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, and Toni Collette. - dbamateurcritic"
1023,"I'm usually writing here to pick the bones out of poor quality shows or films, characters, plots or scripts, but I couldn't find a thing wrong with this film. It was an absolute gem that has raised the bar in film making. The plot, script, setting, everything was first class, and the leading lights shone brilliantly, as did the less famous cast. I wish it were the first of many of this genre. More please."
1024,"Pretty easy to have figured most of the plot by the halfway mark. Enjoyable, but not quite up to the Agatha Christie level."
1025,"This was a good movie but you have to watch it a couple times to really understand it, especially the ending."
1026,"Second time this week I have seen an American Agatha C rip-off. Come on guys Americans are way better than this.The ""writer"" took the entire plot from Agatha getting everyone to have a reason to be the murderer so the audience think it's each one of the guests in turn.And James Bond - what sort of accent is that actuallyWatch it ? No don't bother."
1027,"At the end, Daniel Craig does a Sherlockian illumination of the events, a plot device that is always good fun, but here reads as less than absolutely necessary. There are enough obvious hints to point us in the direction of the culprit.That said, the movie has a great set, is filmed in an engaging way, and I think Craig fills his role well. It's a little bit silly and not airtight, but it's tight enough to be pleasurable ;)"
1028,"Pros:
Well acted
Pretty funny when it wants to be funny
Some nice, cinematic shotsCons:
Problem with mysteries in general, but most of the characters turn out to be useless
Detective isn't actually very cool to watch
Pretentious in its use of callbacks, almost seems like a replacement for interesting writingBest part: explanation at the end, my favorite part of any mystery
Worst part: watching someone get puked on"
1029,"Another classic old school who is the murderer story with a dab of light hearted innuendos and comical backdrop. It was certainly funny to see a protagonist throw up every-time they lie but apart from that the movie certainly lacks what we call a Daniel Craig or Chris Evans movie, oh yes the word was Charisma. It could have been so much better but i am glad they didn't destroy it as bad as they destroyed The murder on orient express."
1030,Awesome story will keep you into the movie beginning to end. Would watch again
1031,"Honestly, the film is not comletely perfect. Though it's such an attractive movie with exciting plots and dark humor,there are some logical confilcts, which is awful for a detective story.
However, I still rate 8 out of 10 on it, for it has remind me of the old-fashioned-suspense film, of Hitchcock and Billy Wilde, of the good old days when film masters worked carefully on original scripts,. Back to that time, 1950s or something else, Hollywood was full of creativity. It was that kind of creativity that gave birth to Star Wars, The Sting or other great films.
But look at what they are doing now! They keep making series, adapting from stories they've already have, for fear of taking the risk losing audience. They are losing their courage and inspiration. Fewer and fewer are orignal stories that can reflect our times and oursevles. Martin Scorsess did say the right thing-personally I'm a Marvel Fan,and I love Captain America and Iron man -The Hollywood is getting stale.
Focus less on special effects, filmmakers, because only when we have a good story will that make sense. This kind of movie is what we need now,.The more, the better."
1032,So entertaining. How's author life created his real dramatic life.
1033,A who-dunit that keeps you guessing when it seems obvious. Can't believe it's the same guy that wrote the last Jedi.
1034,"Watched the movie by renting from Redbox (Back in February)I have watched a lot of murder mystery movies, but knives out is something novel and unique in its way.Movie has some elements of comedy throughout.Excellent acting.Don't expect an edge of seat investigation thriller, this is a different kind of murder mystery investigation.Final verdict: Very good watch."
1035,Morphine overdose theory doesn't apply to the death of frans. Good thriller but the emphasis of the dogs made it pretty obvious in the middle of the movie
1036,"""My Coffee. My House. My Rules.""It's so comforting to watch a film by a director that knows exactly what they want. Like a movie by Spielberg, Scorsese, Tarantino, and Fincher, Rian Johnson has his own distinctive style that adapts to different genres and is pretty effective every time. Like a well trained musician, Johnson knows how to play the notes, hit the beats, and please an audience. Yes, that includes The Last Jedi, which let's remind ourselves, was adored by many critics and audiences despite its reputation. To further the point, Knives Out makes it obvious that Johnson tries to please an audience by the way the movie challenges them, rather than comfort them with familiar tropes. In a sort of Shyamalanian, even Hitchockian, kind of way, Johnson has a need to surprise, an urgency to dissuade the audience from the ability to predict, and for that I am very grateful. When you don't really know where the story is going, you are all the more immersed in it.Knives Out does this in a spectacular fashion. It's so uncharacteristic of a murder-mystery to show the audience the murder itself only forty minutes into the film. Nevertheless, there is still a teasing mystery to be solved by the private detective Benoit Blanc played by Daniel Craig. By the way, who knew Craig can be this charismatic!? The film transforms into a Hitchcock thriller in the second act, with Johnson using every trick in the book to make Blanc's discovery of the culprit a nerve-racking experience akin to watching Dial M For Murder.What's most surprising to me is the film's comedic nature. This felt like a true comedy disguised as a murder-mystery, rather than a murder-mystery with some comedic bits in it. Every scene has jokes in it. Every single one. And they land in such a way that makes this one of the best theater going experiences an audience can have. I was fortunate enough to see this in a theater and the audible laughter proved it was a smart decision. Johnson is able to create quirky, layered, and engrossing characters and have them convincingly and hysterically play off each other. This is of course helped by an impressive star-studded cast. The actors are so tuned-in to not only who their character is, but how they should relate to the other characters. As amazing as Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Christopher Plummer, Toni Collette, Chris Evans and Daniel Craig are, the film belongs to Ana de Armas. The way she plays the character with such earnestness and truth is the heart of the story, the true extension of Harlan Thrombey who is displeased by the double-faced nature of his actual offspring. Kudos to Johnson and the casting director for a memorable ensemble.Straight off the undeserved backlash of The Last Jedi, Johnson has created another movie classic, and proves once again that he is truly a modern day filmmaking genius in his own right, and I look forward to the next Benoit Blanc tale he is going to spin in this movie's sequel. And perhaps, another Star Wars film? One can only hope. But another Johnson murder mystery will in the mean time fill the hole in the donut of anticipation."
1037,"I love good and twisted Who's done its and that is why I looked especially forward to this one, knowing what a great cast and creative mind like Rian Johnson is behind it.
The result is an entertaining, well acted and directed yet often a bit predictable mystery comedy/thriller. What I hoped more for it, was a more out-of-your-mind twist than the one that was actually coming In the end. Still, it was fun and thats its main purpose.
Daniel Craig made a good detective and added a lot of fun attributes to his character. The true revelation of the film was Ana Da Armas who has been under the radar quite a few years yet but finally gets her big break with a truly scene-stealing performance, especially next to acting heavy weights like Michael Shannon or Christopher Plummer who both did very well, too. Chris Evans was also really outstanding and nicely playing with his image which worked perfectly and hopefully opens up for more dynamic or twisted roles in the future. Jamie Lee Cutis and Toni Collette had some fun moments and you could see that both truly loved playing their roles. Don Johnson and especially Jaeden Martell were the weakest spots of the bunch. The score was nice, and the look in general great. It worked like a traditional film of its kind and played along with all the conventional elements without trying to re-invent them which I liked and was most afraid about.
Like I said, the only thing that I could have hoped for was a less predictable final twist and conclusion. Other than than that undoubtedly a fun movie."
1038,It's a great movie and amazing acting of Daniel Craig and Ana de armas With great directing from Ryan it's a must watch
1039,"Bravo Rian Johnson, you made a great murder mystery that had me laughing at 1am, and even tugged on a few heartstrings. One of the best films of the year, and a hell of a way to close out a decade. Better the second time too!"
1040,Silly plot and wasted cast except Collette and Shannon who are hard to look at.
1041,"Mystery movies can certainly be fun, but the refined art of mapping out a crime can be a challenge in this world with ever shrinking attention spans. However, there are still writers and directors out there ready to give it a try in hopes of bringing thought out plots back into the popular trend. Tonight's review holds such a promise and even more so it holds another redeeming trial for a director whose involvement in Star Wars was not the best received. With lots of advertising, I'm sure you have seen the trailers so let's get going as I review:LIKES:Acting
The Cinematography
The Plot Is A Good Mystery
Better Twists Than Anticipated
Involvement With Most Of The Cast
The ComedyDISLIKES:
Some rather worthless characters
The Run Time
The Pace
Perhaps A Little More MurderThe VERDICT:With an assembled cast such as this, you can best bet the acting will be at least moderate, and for me it was a fantastic display of work. All parties assembled really play the dysfunctional role well, portraying the motive filled shouts and complaints to an art that did not annoy or go overboard. Too many names to place I'll say that Craig was entertaining in his role of Colonel Saunders (a running joke) meeting James Bond as the detective, primarily in his interactions with Marta. Ana de Armas was the star for me not only because of her character, but more so in the way she played the levels of emotion perfectly and interacted with the squad the most to balance this art. Past the acting, the movie really picks up in terms of the visual presentation, feeling much like a detective movie from the 50s-80s, but modernizing it to the present day. It should captivate many mystery lovers, but more so generic fans who can point out a lot of devices and nods to famous detective sagas. However, the movie's main selling point is the presentation of the story that let's face it has been told time and time again in a Hallmark like fashion. Johnson, for me, accomplished the role of bringing out a good mystery, not only in the classic hunt for clues and mapping out suspects, but adding some nice twists to the mix. If you are paying attention to time and some info, you'll start getting an idea, but this film's twists (no matter how convoluted) do manage to spruce up the dusty manor of detective works. An even better angle for me, is the character utilization, while not perfect, every character has a purpose in some form or angle, with few sitting off to the sides as just mere bodies to fill a convenient hole or bridge. If not for the sake of the plot, then the character was used for comedy and that may be my favorite part of this movie. Knives Out manages to be very humorous in the regards of the comedy aspect, with well written dialogue, delivery of those lines, and timing wrapping up nicely to leave many laughing during my showing. That I feel will be a pull for many audience members, though don't expect usual slapstick, banter, and ridiculous, logic defying stunts to be pulled here, or you'll be disappointed.For such an artistic film though, there are still a few things I would have liked tightened up. Though all characters were utilized in some form, I can't lie at least three could have had more involvement than what they did. Hinting at being a part of the plot, these characters were left to the passing comments or joke props until that one moment a clue contributed. That family engagement they sold in the trailers, needed some more development for me to keep everyone entangled in the mess as opposed to on the side. In addition, the plot could have used a little more murder and threats to help spice up the drama/mystery, as I am partial to the deadly games of hunting in my movies, than anything else. For a movie selling that murder, I had kind of expected something else, but it's a mere trinket. I can say the thing I had the hardest time with was the run time and the pace. Knowing it's a Johnson movie, I expect it to be long, and for the most part the movie ran at a good enough pace that it did not feel super long, but other times did show the dragging I dreaded. I can say that there were parts that could have been cut out to shorten the length, or at least rewritten to include the character interaction I mentioned above.So in conclusion, what are the thoughts on this controversial movie/tale. To be honest, I do think it is a reimagining of Clue, and took a step into the modern world to help reach out to the new audiences. It's got the presentation of a mystery, with twists to help bring our well-acted characters together and entertain us with their drama. Comedy is also pulled out of the sheath and I think these two elements are the biggest selling factors to brave the nearly 2.5 hour run time Johnson has put forth. As such, I feel this movie is worth a shot at hitting the theaters for those looking for a drama/mystery/comedy, while others will most likely enjoy from the comfort of their homes.My scores for Knives Out are:Comedy/Crime/Drama: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0"
1042,"I don't understand why people are judging Rian Johnson for just one movie that they though ruined Star Wars(which in my personal opinion it didn't), but maybe this movie can help people come to their senses on how great of a director Rian Johnson is. Cause in the case of this movie, Knives Out is a expertly crafted murder mystery with thrilling twists, a pitch perfect cast, and a experience for everyone to get a kick out of. Almost every twist in this film got me, except maybe the last one but I was a little tipped in assumptions so it still kinda got me. The cast was also perfect, especially Ana de Armas, who does a really good impression of her illness as well as a really good performance overall and Daniel Craig, who does an excellent job as the detective even though he isn't directly in the first few minutes of the film but immediately makes himself central when brought in. The rest of the cast is just as good as those two and their dynamic feels general and absolutely hilarious at some points. That's also another thing I liked about this movie. It's a murder mystery but it doesn't take itself too seriously. I actually laughed quite a bit during this film and it's all just because of the excellent chemistry of the cast. The movie overall is crafted in a way that's quite distinct from other murder mysteries I've seen and most of that is do to like I said this film not taking itself too seriously. Overall Rian Johnson has once again proven himself a confident director by crafting a well told murder mystery with a cast that feels genuine in their chemistry and twists that you will still be thinking about after the movie is over. So to all of you angry Star Wars nerds, maybe this movie will have you look at Rian a little differently.Final rating: 9.6/10"
1043,"Makes me wonder why we don't get many murder mysteries anymore, hopefully after this we will.An all star cast with some very good acting make this a film will work watching for a good plot with plenty of twists but also sprinkled with comedy right through out.I don't want to give anything away but I felt it came up just s little short of a classic but I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone."
1044,"Rian Johnson's latest creation brings life to a genre that is dead - murder mystery thriller. The talent on screen captures the narrative, with sharp and witty dialogue, perfect directing and incredible pool of talented actors especially Danniel Craig, it makes this movie phenomenal and entertaining. It is the most entertaining movie i have seen all year.The main highlight of the movie is Danniel Craig's scene stealing performance which capture your imagination.."
1045,"Rian Johnson's Neo-Noir debut successfully emulates the tone, that of which presumably influenced, Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express. The farcical and intricately written script combined with an iconic and wonderfully curated cast creates a cinematic mystery venture that is not to be missed."
1046,"I just got out of Knives Out, it was a packed screening at 11am on a Wednesday.Once again Rhian Johnson pulls the old bait and switch, I went to see one movie, but got another!! Oh how this guy loves subverting expectations!!It's hard to say if I liked it or not, as I was disappointed to not get the all star, murder mystery ensemble I had been promised in the trailers, but I did enjoy what I got though, and I laughed a few times. I'd say it's a thriller more than a murder mystery. Oh and it has a political message too!! They are not subtle undertones, they hit you over the head with it.All of the big stars have don't have that much screen time, Daniel Craig probably has the most, whilst Jamie Lee Curtis has the least, Ana de Armas gets the most screen time, and she is hardly in the trailers.The cast are all having fun in their roles and its hard not to enjoy yourself when they are in screen, but I'd have to say Ana De Armas is the best one here.I can't get into what I didn't like too much without going into spoilers etc, but all in all I enjoyed it for what it was, instead of hating it for what it wasn't."
1047,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""I suspect 'fow-uhl' play."" So states the renowned and poetically named private detective, Benoit Blanc. Of course when mega-wealthy, best-selling author Harlan Thrombey supposedly commits suicide after his 85th birthday party by slashing his own throat with a knife, something more sinister (you know, like ... murder) must be considered. The violin playing over the opening shots of the palatial Thrombey manor teases us with thoughts of most any year from the past 75. These nostalgic thoughts fade quickly as we begin to meet the players.Detective Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (a quite funny Noah Segan) seem merely to be crossing their T's in the suicide investigation as they dutifully meet with each family member for a statement. It's this progression of questioning that introduces us to the year's most colorful ensemble cast. Patriarch Thrombey's (Christopher Plummer) scheming heirs-in-waiting include: his daughter Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), happy to remind you of her success as a self-made businessperson; Linda's smarmy husband Richard (Don Johnson); their renegade son Ransom (Chris Evans) who arrives a bit later; Harlan's son Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon) who 'runs' the family publishing business; Harlan's ex-daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette), a self-help guru who has a secret side gig; grandkids Meg (Katherine Langford), preppy social media troll Jacob (Jaeden Martell), and Donna (Riki Lindhome of ""Garfunkel and Oates""); and Harlan's mother Greatnana (Dallas' own K Callan). Two key non-family members are the housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) who finds Harlan's body, and nurse Marta (Ana de Armas), Harlan's friend and only real confidante.Writer-director Rian Johnson has put together a diverse career with such films as indie breakout BRICK (2005), science fiction hit LOOPER (2012) and of course, STAR WARS: EPISODE VIII - THE LAST JEDI (2018). With this latest, he shows a real flair with a rare comedic whodunit, and manages to perfectly execute his twisted script of twisted personalities. Think of this as Agatha Christie meets CLUE via THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS. The overall mangled morality of this entitled family becomes crystal clear as we get to know each. Johnson presents many familiar elements for fans of the mystery genre (the dark mansion, the creepy line-up of hangers-on, the red-herring clues and missteps), and most impressively, he blends those with many creative and surprising moments ... some that will have you believing you have it figured out. But even if you do, the long and winding road is an utter blast.Even with that deep and talented cast, it's Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas as Marta who stand out. They have the most screen time and neither waste a moment. Mr. Craig's purposefully comedic southern drawl completes the film's most memorable character, in fact, one of the year's most memorable characters. Ms. de Armas finally finds a role to take advantage of her skill. Nurse Marta has a lie-detecting reflux gag that is not just valuable to the case, but also vital to the loudest audience reaction during the film. Mr. Craig and Ms. de Armas will also appear together in the upcoming Bond film NO TIME TO DIE.During the reading of the will, director Johnson brings in STAR WARS stalwart Frank Oz (best known as Yoda) to play the family attorney, while another scene features one of the all-time great character actors (and Roger Ebert favorite) M. Emmet Walsh (BLOOD SIMPLE). Mr. Johnson also offers a unique spin on classism and the 1%, including a running gag about Marta's nation of origin.Johnson's regular team is in top form here: Cinematographer Steve Yedlin, Film Editor Bob Ducsay, and composer Nathan Johnson (Rian's cousin). Another deserving of mention is Costume Designer Jenny Eagan, who matches threads with personality about as effectively as we've seen, and Production Designer David Crank who creates the ideal mansion of secrets. This film is wickedly clever and barrels of fun. There may not have been a more purely entertaining movie this year ... and it's been a terrific year for movies. Just remember: 'My house. My rules. My coffee."""
1048,"Great acting throughout the whole movie. The problem is that the focus was on political correctness (white people always bad, immigrants always good) instead of filling logical gaps in the story. Missed opportunity."
1049,"You take a perfectly good cast and you waste them. The real protagonist was an evil nurse who did everything to mislead the police in order to cover for he incompetence. And eventhough in the end it appears that she was not responsible, she was. Because she stood by as the old man took his life.
She took the fortune for herself instead of giving it back."
1050,"Seriously, if you're not a big fan of mysteries, skip this decidedly mediocre film. If you are a big fan, see it -- you will enjoy the flick. It was hard to stay awake for the first 2/3 of the movie as it meandered along. Aside from the lead actress being adorable and Daniel Craig miraculously maintaining his southern accent throughout the film, there was little to draw a viewer's attention. The final third got interesting and at times compelling even to a non-fan of mysteries. But I'd have rather seen an important and thoroughly mesmerizing compelling film like ""Dark Waters"" a second time to seeing ""Knives Out"" even once.That is, unless you are a big fan of the who dun it genre. My wife, who is such a fan, really enjoyed this frequent mess of a movie. I suppose if the film had come with a scorecard and the players names on the backs of their ""uniforms,"" it may have been possible for laypeople (i.e. not big ""who dun it"" fans) to make sense of what was happening."
1051,It was perfectly twisty and unpredictable. Even my husband liked it. 😁
1052,"Of course it's a great movie, destined to be a cult classic......and the intelligence of the plot is mind-bending.....don't want to give any spoilers here! And the fact that there wasn't much buzz about it here in India, and we went to see it without knowing what to expect, made it all the more a bigger, better surprise. Lastly, Craig and Evans - no doubt itching to subvert their stereotyping, have done so brilliantly, and how! Full marks :-)"
1053,Call me old fashioned but why is it necessary to have quite a bit of bad language including F words and rate this as suitable for 12 year olds ? Sick of sitting through this sort of stuff that is usually pumped out by American productions that is deemed acceptable for children - it's not and the example you're setting as repercussions.
1054,"It's overrated, I think Daniel Craig it's not a good fit for this character. He looks a little ""tryhard"". I like him, but not in this movie. The plot was ""eh"", it wasn't fluid with all the evidence and characters. You can watch it if you are bored. If the main character it's not suitable, it kinda ruins anything else."
1055,"It's a great thriller but Very Slow in the starting.
After 1st half the movie goes Up and u really need Patience to enjoy this movie"
1056,This movie is Masterpiece and instant classic it is incredible in every way possible cast is great plot incredible directing was miles better than I've expected from Ryan Johnson considering what a garbage last Jedi was.so if you're searching for movie to watch try knives out you won't regret it
1057,"Rian Johnson brings to screen Agatha Christie type of mystery. A murder takes place. The people in the house are the prime suspects. They can't leave the house until the murderer is caught. There is also a big reveal towards the end. This movie is everything that a fan of mystery novels can ask for.
There are red herrings in this movie and you actually fall for them. Ignoring a few things that are very illogical, like a girl who vomits after telling a lie, this movie is engaging. There are no loose ends when the credits start rolling. Rian Johnson finishes the story neatly without leaving any room for plot holes. The screenplay deserves a special mention. The editing is brisk and racy, effectively keeping you on the edge of your seat. The music is at best, forgettable.
Over all, this movie is a gem among trash like sequels and superhero movies that Hollywood made in 2019."
1058,"The movie begins with intriguing dialogues that grasps your attention. It is difficult to take your eyes off even though not being a high paced standard American film. The plot is continuously surprising which brings out the ""Agatha Christie"" effect. I recommend this film for all detective lovers and all of those that like a complex mystery. BANGIN!"
1059,"This is hands down the ""best"" movie of 2019. Before viewing this, I was in fact sold that Irishman, OUTIH, 1917, or Parasite would win it. But the truth is that all of those movies are flawed heavily. It was only a matter if there wasn't anything better out there (because they are all pretty good), and then came along Knives Out.The only way this doesn't win is if the lighthearted humorous and quirky vibe turn some voters off compared to the seriousness and pretentiousness of the aforementioned movies. It's not only about entertainment (popcorn style) either. it's simply the best movie of the year, with the least weaknesses and errors within itself."
1060,"This film was wonderful. The cast was amazing and turn the murder-mystery storyline on it's head, had spectacular writing and modern context and is something you should watch again and again and again!I did hear that people have been taking the rsting of this film due to Rian Johnson being the director, and if that's the case it's reflects more on those people's ego and character than his directorial preformance.Regardless, the film was enjoyable and it deserves some awards. Also Chris Evans in a sweater was quite hot, no?"
1061,"What a story to tell with great casting, wonderful performances. I was on my seat's edge the entire movie time. This is a great work to be witnessed by everyone."
1062,"A great script and dialogue + great actors + great technical aspects = one the most entertaining movie of the year. Incredible plot twist, it is like watching a magician play his trick. You will never know how he does the trick, and if you do, you would still enjoy it."
1063,"A lot of twist, really interesting keeping me entertained the whole movie!!!!! I really like this"
1064,My family and I saw this movie twice! All the actors did a great job! Well done! 🙌🏻🙌🏻
1065,Everything is beautiful in this movie. No mistakes
1066,"Absolutely delightful. You don't have to be a Miss Maple or Hercule Poirot fan to enjoy this movie, but it will let you in on the inside joes. This whole script is written and performed with its tongue firmly in its cheek. It is a wonderful parody with a great cast. It acrobatically delivers its twists within twists. Thoroughly entertaining. I give this film an 8.5 (delightful) out of 10. {Mystery Parody}"
1067,"Knives Out is about the dad of the family committing suicide or what they say. Someone hires a detective to investigate the the murder when there is a bunch of fishy things going on.Knives Out is one of the best films of the year. I knew it was going to be good, but not this good. They did something I haven't seen in a murder mystery before. I won't say because it will get into spoiler territory. I just thought it was really cool and surprised me. The acting was something you had to mention. Chris Evans had the best performance in my mind. He was funny and also really serious when he needed to be. You haven't really seen him play a character like this since Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World. Daniel Craig was pretty solid. It did take me a little while to get used to Daniel Craig's weird accent, but I did. I wouldn't really say it made his character any better. I thought he could have been talking normal and the movie would have been the same. Ana De Armas was pretty good in this film too. She was the main character easily. I think a thing nobody is really talking about is how well the cinematography was. They had some pretty impressive zooms. Like I talked a little bit about earlier was how well the story was. The only thing I didn't like was in the middle act it started to drag a little. It is a really hard thing to make the middle act interesting and keep the same pace as the start of the movie. I really praise a movie when they do that. This movie didn't do it was well as others. Now the third and final act was a masterpiece. I really have to say, it was riveting and intense while also pretty darn interesting. It explained everything for the whole movie. The start of the movie was pretty solid too. It didn't really start as I thought it would, but it still started out with a bang.Overall, Knives Out was a great film that definitely reunited the murder mystery genre after the film Murder Mystery and the remake of Murder On The Orient Express. I would definitely recommend it."
1068,"Dialogue heavy, murder mystery, thriller.Told in flash-back and the style of an Agatha Christie murder mystery.
A famous crime novelist is found dead at his country estate just after his 85th birthday, the cops are already there interviewing the family but there's also a charming private investigator sleuth who has been mysteriously solicited to piece together the evidence and uncover the truth behind the novelist's apparent 'suicide'.Modern-day whodunit with a fantastic cast where everyone is a suspect, everyone has a motive. Highly recommended."
1069,"Really surprised at how so many people love this movie. Although, all my friends I saw it with loved it too so...
To me the ""twist"" was super obvious from very early on. So then it just was really boring waiting for it to end.
Also, my friends liked the political back and forth but I did not find it engaging or even interesting. Maybe because my own family is very politically divided.
Lastly (and someone else said this in there review on here as well), the main detective was like Kevin Spacey doing Frank Underwood. Which with everything that has come out about Spacey, left me with a really uncomfortable feeling.
Also, fwiw, apparently there's a big Star Wars controversy thing going with the director but a) I didn't know any of that until after I saw it and b) I am not a Star Wars fan, so my opinion of the movie has zero to do with any of that drama."
1070,"After last jedi was simple said huge debute among people who loved or hate it,i think knives out at least will please most of the people who saw it or will watch it,it has bsiggest star cast of the year where everyone give good performances and it was good written film, i think that rian johnson should stick to this type of films and not some big budget films it would be better for him and for us"
1071,"The ending was really awesome, with a perfect twist that I honestly didn't see coming. The plot was well developed and made for an awesome reveal. The acting from the whole cast was superb, Ana de Armas was perfect as Marta. There was great chemistry between the family members. I sort of felt like the story was slow going and the build up to the final reveal could have been streamlined."
1072,Interesting 1000+ male and 200+ female reviewers. Why is that? And what do you think the breakdown of the 300+ haters who voted a 1 is?Beautifully written and directed movie. Very entertaining. Great production design.Enjoyed my mug!
1073,"Rian Johnson is a pretty hot property right now, what with the Star Wars credits, a decent science fiction movie, and so on. For a number of critics, the analysis of the movie ends there.Because this is flat out not a very good movie. The twists are not prdictable - far from it - so incredibly complex as to be completely unbelievable. At the center of the plot is an absolute absurdity. The patriarch of the family apparently committed suicide by cutting his own throat - an incredibly painful way to die - because he thought he had been accidentally overdosed with morphine. Absolutely absurd. Only he hasn't been overdosed because of an incredibly contrived series of events . . .. . . all of which have nothing to do with the various motivations of his heirs to do him in, established in some detail - the most entertaining part of the movie. As the movie goes on and drifts into the detail necessary to make all of the preposterous contrivances work, all this interesting background is completely lost, or ignored.Along the way a police lab is completely destroyed by the simple expedient of throwing an arson device through a window, because you know how insecure those places are. Etc., etc., etc.A splendid cast wasted. This is just not a very good movie."
1074,Personally I really Enjoyed this movie. Anna De Armas deserves an Oscar for her role in this. The screenplay was very whitty yet its end was a little predictable it doesn't take away from the good in this movie.
1075,"Knives Out is one of the best movies i have seen this year. Fantastic, unpredictable story. Kudos to the writer(s) who created this high-class drama full of interesting characters. Knives Out displays Riveting Acting from the All-Star Cast. Jaime Lee Curtis is as always in top form. All did AWESOME. Even the supporting stars shine. An Ensemble like this is not easy to find at all. Yet, you will see major Hollywood names here doing their craft superbly. To me, this movie should win Oscar(s). In short, Knives Out did not disappoint me. I bet you will like it too. I just tell you one thing: pay attention to every detail and listen the dialogues and exchanges between the characters. There are clues in there, though the writers threw some curves aiming at confusing you in a good way. You have to watch and think, mi amigo(a). For example, this line: ""You did this."" After you have enjoyed the movie, you'd know what I mean. Seat Back, Relax and Enjoy the Show."
1076,Knives Out is entertaining and quite a win. It has a stellar cast and uses them well. The story and mystery has echoes of Agatha Christie in this decent whodunit. What you think is straightforward has a few interesting twists. It also doesn't take itself too seriously and has the odd dose of humour. It was also easy to understand and follow the series of events. Not unnecessarily complicated. The film did feel a tad bit long. Overall a decent watch and recommended. 8/10
1077,There need to be more movies like this. It felt like I was watching a game of Clue being played out and it was just fun the whole time. 10/10 would recommend for anyone who wants to see a movie they will enjoy.
1078,It's definitely a different type of movie probably not what you're expecting when you walk in at least for me it wasn't but I really did like the story the only thing is it felt short to me
1079,"Hollywood are incapable of conjuring up any form of cinematic experience without feeling the need to throw in their contemporary political ideologies, smack dab from the getgo.It's really sad. Though I'm glad i could press Stop without having wasted any money on it. Hope you get better soon America.Now, if you'll all excuse me, i'll be over at Bollywood's stuff."
1080,Nice twist in the end. Acting is excellent and a great story!
1081,"This is the most boring movie I have ever seen. I even fell asleep in the cinema during it. Nothing new, everything in it we saw before in lots of others movies. Even if they put my favorite actors (as Al Pacino, Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Matt Damon, Keanu Reeves etc) it would be boring. I was traumatized after watching it. Big dislike."
1082,Not a dull moment in this film. Live the sequence of events and how the mystery unsolved. Superb acting of course. And may I say Ana (who plays Marta) should be more in the lead in that cover because she's literally more main than some of the big stars in the film!
1083,"For the most part, I'm not a Rian Johnson fan. But I loved this movie for sure. I enjoy a good mystery and this is no exception. Throughout the whole movie, you do not know who did it. Even when you're analyzing, the answer doesn't become clear. There's plenty of twists and crime-solving. You get a sense that everyone isn't being very truthful. And sometimes it's just really funny. Do yourself a favor and watch it; please.8.8/10 (Great)"
1084,"A little confusing, but, so are all great murder mysteries. I'd give it a 10 if it were an uplifting film."
1085,"This movie does not involve capes or ""IP."" It is not a sequel. It is not adapted from a novel. It is not an art house flick or Oscar bait. Which begs the question...how did it get made? All I know is Rian Johnson just proved it is still possible to write and direct a great genre film that is self aware but still takes its story and its characters seriously (and even manages to make some points without trying too hard). The cast is great. The homages to classic murder mysteries are fantastic. The humor is both hilarious and subtle. The twists are just right. I hope EVERYONE goes to see it because EVERYONE can enjoy it. Here's hoping more filmmakers (and studios) are willing to tell these kinds of stories. In an era where most blockbusters feel derivative, sometimes originality is just telling familiar stories really damn well and making them feel new again."
1086,"Let's see - what do I remember about this thing. Jamee Lee Curtis was a star and I think she was the killer. Maybe not. Or maybe. Anyways, if I remember correctly, this one huge family live in this massive house. While the family is gathered in the house, with Bond, James Bond, something happens. No wait. Danial Craig gets there after someone gets killed. He also has a number of different accents y'all. I think this was made for those actors Waiting for something to do. The disjointed script and splatter-plot makes this pointless comedy-mystery hard to sit through. If you haven't seen it, don't...if you have, you the movie stinks."
1087,"Just a real waste of a good cast. This was an over funded, over hyped and less well done imitation of 'Murder She Wrote.' Just watch literally any episode of that. It could be that I'm just old, but that's probably not it."
1088,"Such a high quality cast and great acting yet, this movie just bored me to tears. I couldn't stay interested."
1089,"Full of topics, no rithm at all, poor Craig reduced to ridicule by name and accent, plot twisted and retwisted and reretwisted without a single thrill, it made me the same effect that a lie to Marta (disgusting idea, by the way)."
1090,"Enjoyable, sure, especially when we get to stare at Ana de Armas face for 2 hours. Craig's performance is fun and Shannon doesn't come across as his usual blue collar boob type, and even Evans was kind of interesting. But when you sit back and consider the story itself, the implausibilities start becoming more and more annoying.Nobody suddenly commits suicide when they're also making notes for future story ideas, sitting on a fortune, and coincidentally still even functional after a 100mg morphine injection. And cutting ones throat? Really?Who meets up with a known killer with a lot to lose in a private, remote location indoors??? If we've learned anything from a hundred years of movies and tv shows, it's that you always meet an adversary in a public place with a lot of people around. She may just be a housekeeper, but nobody is that dumb.Also, how are we to believe a private nurse who's given the same injections to the same patient in the same room probably hundreds of times would suddenly, accidentally mix up her vials?"
1091,"If you are a fan of classic murder mysteries, whodunits and Clue, this movie is agreeable but a huge disappointment. Daniel Craig's southern accent is horrendous. The rest of the acting is pedestrian and the actual mystery is not compelling."
1092,"The best detective/murder-mystery genre movie of the decade i would say. The title itself means a lot till the climax/anti-climax. Chris Evans and Daniel Craig; in a completely different role after Cap and Bond, respectively. Tight Plot, Intriguing scenes, though plot can be derived out by Hardcore Poirot fans."
1093,"#KnivesOut is an absolute blast and it is one of the most entertaining films you shall see for some time.
It is also meticulously conceived and carefully executed. In #KnivesOut, everything just works. Even if you don't like mysteries you shall like this one!! 😊It takes you for a ride with the help of smart writing and superior direction. You shall love the humour and especially #DanielCraig's ludicrous yet perfect performance.This cracking mystery is a lean-forward experience, as the movie lures you deeper and deeper into its intricately plotted layers.Not mentioning anything else. Go watch it! 😊😊"
1094,"From the moment the film started we were engrossed. I must admit that on first hearing Daniel Craig's southern accent I found it a little odd, but on watching him in the rest of the film, he was just brilliant and played a great part. For us he was no longer Craig but the P.I. At times, early on, his character reminded me of inspector Clouseau, when the the clues were right under his nose and he was completely missing them. Very funny.I didn't know what to expect and as the story unfolded we wondered where it was going and who did what. It is so well acted, with the great cast bringing all the characters to life. It was comical how the family 'loved' Marta, the nurse, and thought of her as 'one of the family', yet each one gave a different country of her origin! Proving that actually, they didn't - as long she looked after Dad/Grandpa, they couldn't care less about her.I loved the way that Craig's private detective put all the clues together, just as Christie did in her books. Curtis was great too, as usual.I only recognised Jamie Lee Curtis and Daniel Craig in the cast, as I'd not heard of the others, and it shows you really don't need famous faces to make a great film."
1095,Knives Out sharpens old murder-mystery conventions with a carefully constructed suspense outing making excellent use of the stellar ensemble of writer-director Rian Johnson.
1096,"Good movie, good cast. Great suspense. No action, so action lovers might not find it interesting. Story has a good twist."
1097,This was an excellent movie. I loved Daniel Craig's acting !!
1098,Anyone that has rated this movie before seeing it is something that you should have as a question IMBD?!??
1099,"This movie isn't about a family and their inheritance, it's about America and immigration."
1100,"First off, I'll admit that as a murder mystery movie its got a unique angle to it. But other than that, this movie is boring and falls flat.
The actors are under used...Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson are barely in it. Daniel Craig does his best Foghorn Leghorn impression (heres a hint: if the character is southern GET A SOUTHERN ACTOR!)
which is really distracting. I didnt care about any of the characters and I didnt really care about the outcome. If youre looking for a quirky character driven Wes Anderson style mystery...this isnt it."
1101,If you watch these kind of movies it's too cliche. It's too long. Cast is good. The cliche part actually didn't bother me.The problem is characters in this movie are not well written based on its script. Harlan the rich man bequeathed his entire estate to Marta but there is no actual reason for that. His children are not that bad and even he admitted his mistakes. Let's say he changed his mind and he wanted to give some things to Marta.Why not Linda or Meg but Marta? He didn't give anything to Linda or Meg. That thing as ridicilous as the throw up thing and as I said the movie is too long.
1102,"Well I am big fan for both the great writer Agatha cristie and Daniel Craig the bond, well I expected more than that tbh, what encouraging me was the reviews and the critics rate, well the movie is not even good as poirot series or marble and cant even compared it to any of Sherlock BBC series or the movies, the movie was a regular simple with nothing special about the act or the directing or the soundtracks, the story idea was OK and the very special thing was very disgusting thing which was the vomiting ofc
I gave it five stars and holding my self to give 3"
1103,This movie doesnt even have a solid point. A really bad plot.
1104,"I can not believe Daniel Craig has put his name towards this, it is so boring and cliche."
1105,"I usually hate movies that treat viewers like morons, and this movie is pretty insulting in that aspect.The ""quirky"" detective played by Daniel Craig was the worst part of it, I swear this movie would have been one million times better if he had died. Preferably in a rather undignified, anti-climatic manner.I honestly think people was so happy for finally having the chance of seeing a Hollywood film that wasn't a remake, sequel, reboot, or part of a franchise that they
didn't mind very much the film in question being total garbage.This movie won't survive the test of time, and it will become one of those movies that were beloved at their time, but completely forgotten shortly after."
1106,I have a touchy spot for detective movies as they usually are very good 10/10 or terrible and are not thought out properly. This is one of the good ones it has so many elaborate parts building up to that last big reveal of what truly happened.Very good highly recommend 👍.
1107,"A really fun watch! It looks boring at first, but watch it carefully, it will definitely shock you as it did us!Great murder mystery"
1108,"Love a good whodunit cannot beat the all star cast! Fabulous story! Christopher Plummer always awesome and Craig, Evans, Anna De Armas, Shannon, Curtis and cast all excellent! Recommend!"
1109,"KNIVES OUT (2019) ***1/2 Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield, Christopher Plummer, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell, Riki Lindhome, Edi Patterson, Frank Oz, K Callan, Noah Segan, M. Emmett Walsh, Marlene Forte, (voice of Joseph Gordon-Levitt) Filmmaker Rian Johson's mystery black comedy about the investigation of the apparent suicide of the affluent patriarch of a squabbling, self-entitled brood resulting in a twisty-turny parable of the wants and have nots with societal ills underpinning with deliciously outrageous plot points sprinkled along the way. A game ensemble cast acts the hell out of a shopworn parlor drama with aplomb particularly Evans as the black sheep of the family and kind-hearted but very implicated caregiver de Armas."
1110,"I don't even care if the movie has a good plot or if the acting is good. Daniel Craig's accent is so bad it's unwatchable. If you are a Yankee and don't know what a southern accent is supposed to sound like, perhaps you could enjoy the movie. My wife and I turned it off after 30 minutes - Simply unwatchable.Never, in the history of moviedom, had anyone botched an accent as badly."
1111,Another white savior story with token brown people.
1112,Daniel Craig with a stereotypical old southern gentleman accent No thank you I couldn't even get half way through this movie. It sucked Imo
1113,"Worth seeing. I wish more movies would be made with this love, fun, imagination, and daring."
1114,"I knew it would be good do to Johnson's track record (specifically Looper and The Last Jedi) but damn, it's so good. The cast is awesome (Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, Micheal Shannon, and Don Johnson are standouts, but everyone is good) and one of the best ensembles ever put to screen. The film looks like it was shot on film, but it was actually filmed on digital but they did a great job with giving it that look. The colors in the sets and wardrobe pop of the screen. The story is full of twists and turns but never looses focus and makes for a fun viewing experience. In one scene the do take jabs at Trump (he deserves it) and part of the story is about illegal immigrants, so be careful who you watch it with or the could be offended."
1115,Very good plot line and story! You never knew what was coming around the corner!
1116,Not as good as many people say. If you have seen more than 3 good movies you will see through this one during the first act. Is not surprising and is not that well acted.
1117,"One of the best movies from 2019 without a doubt, which deserves more recognition."
1118,"This movie is so overrated. Mediocre plot, mediocre directing and a good soundtrack. Reminds me of the last jedi.
There's gotta be a reason why critics love everything rian Johnson does?"
1119,"I liked this film but it was by no means a great. To call it a tribute to Agatha Christie would have the woman turn in her grave. It was a decent film I recommend you watching but it was overlong by at least one hour. We reached the 46 minute mark thinking we'd been there an hour and a half and it was about to wrap up... the Gil is more than 2 hours long and has at least 40 minutes of padding. The writers should have learned from Christie to hack out unnecessary dialogue and drawn out drivel.Katherine Langford is a terrible and overrated actress. Stop hiring her. Her face, her voice, her mannerisms, her attitude... it's all a flop and I took a star off my rating just because of her. She really let this film down. From now on I will never watch a film if she's in it. Absolutely terrible acting.Harlan and the nurse are by far the best characters, Harlan being my favourite. Their acting was by far the best in the whole film."
1120,"A very good detective movie. Throughout the movie there were unexpected twist and turns. After a long time I watched a very good movie. Would recommend it to anyone who would like to have a good time watching a movie. The one thing which makes me feel odd is that the detective was able to notice the blood strain on the nurse's shoe but she never noticed it even once. Bit strange to believe.After watching Daniel Craig in a couple of Bond movies as a action hero, it's bit odd to see him in this detective role."
1121,"This movie was absolutely brilliant. The more underlying themes of good vs evil was a little more prominent tow my towards the end. The movie always had me on my toes. Always guessing the next step which is hard to find in productions today. It didn't need an action. The story arc was just brilliant. However, this movie is not fit for pure souls. I had no intention of watching the rest of the production whence Marta was declared the reason for his death."
1122,"One of the best story line. The movie cuts to the chase, without any unneeded things."
1123,"I had some doubts when I first saw the trailer. I had initially rolled my eyes and thought that Knives Out would it be a fairly standard, average run-of-the-mill murder mystery that would also try to too hard to be funny that it would come across as arrogant & self-absorbed in its own ""art"", similar the posturing tone of the Grand Budapest Hotel. Yet these dismal expectations of Knives Out were thankfully and surprisingly dashed.The film strikes the perfect balance of intrigue, suspense, excitement, eccentricity, warmth and amusement. The entire cast are excellent, particularly Daniel Craig and the main character. There are some really funny scenes too and it's quite difficult to make me laugh out loud at the comedy material applied to most films. Yes, it can of course be argued that Knives Out has the usual tropes of the traditional Agatha Christie styled murder mysteries, but it builds on those traditional tropes and I think it creates something quite unique. It made quite an impression."
1124,You will not regret two hours of sitting. Watch it hellll!!
1125,"An excellent mystery, crime movie der alten Schule"
1126,"Just watch the movie everybody, it is a fine example of fine cinematography, acting, direction and script! Thumbs up and major proof that a good movie doesn't need millions to be made! Bravo!"
1127,"I had no idea what to expect except Captain America telling people to eat $#*/ but it delivered that and so much more. Rian Johnson does his thing, subverting the detective genre and its a perfect fit. Smart, stylish writing, perfect performances, a lot of laughs, and an engaging memorable plot, Knives Out is the most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time and I can't recommend it enough."
1128,"I guess you can't come up with a better gift for detective fans than Ryan Johnson's ""Knives Out"". This screenplay keeps the audience in an atmosphere of intrigue and humor until the final credits.A successful mystery writer decided to commit suicide. However, it is unclear why he did it or whether it was suicide. When the whole family meets to discuss the division of the inheritance, private detective Benoit Blanc comes to find out the real circumstances of the death of the head of the house.The detective often shows his cynical humor. In one scene, he said : ""When people get desperate, they get out their knives"". This explains the meaning of the film's title.Throughout the film the audience observes the intrigues that are built mainly on the dialogues of the characters. Spectators examine each character in details. Daniel Craig, who played the role of a detective, showed incredible skills and actor's play.This film is suitable for different categories of viewers. Definitely cost to watch."
1129,"Funny, mysterious, dramatic - that's Knives Out.
With numerous twists and turns, this film kept me on the edge of my seat throughout its entire runtime. Right when you think you know who is responsible - boom! Benoit Blanc discovers another piece of evidence that derails the investigation even more.
The actors are phenomenal, as expected. Daniel Craig's performance as detective Benoit Blanc is absolutely incredible. The characters are as charming as insufferable. Ransom is a particularly good example in this sense, as he walks the line between good and bad multiple times in the movie, leaving us as well as Marta utterly confused.
Visually gorgeous, tons of symbolism, and witty dialogue - all strong points of this film."
1130,"The script is very solid, originally thought it was a wonderful reasoning story, but on the basis of mysterious reasoning, there is still a lot of black humor and irony. Each character in the movie is very colorful, and the character image is three-dimensional. There are many series that need careful scrutiny."
1131,"I loved the clue board that is Knives Out. The setting, characters, & story were all tailored to feel like an Agatha Christie mystery. There was a considerable amount of twists & turns that never felt out of place. Marta's journey with Blanc manages to show the true side of every character, including Marta. All in all, a well spent 2 hours of my time. Definitely a movie I would recommend, even just to hear Daniel Craig's accent."
1132,"This film is so well planned and delivered. I really appreciate the effort of screenplay and the choice of the actors for this film.
The storyline goes well revealing 3/4th of the story in the beginning but gets along with the twist till the end.
Do watch it! It's good."
1133,"The first hour of the movie is a total waste. The only interesting character is Jamie Curtis'. The story takes off at the reading of the will. Chris Evans is really the only truly interesting character in the movie. The rest of them are totally predictable. I had such high hopes with such a great and talented cast, but the script really suffered. Too bad, all the way around."
1134,"Though I was one step ahead of the story most of the time, I nonetheless loved the execution. A collectible classic!"
1135,Definitely one of the best Murder mystery movies i have ever seen...ever!!!
1136,"Rian makes an amazing film that brings suspense and questions which is perfect for this type of film. Even though it was not necessarily a murder ""mystery"" it does brings a surprise twist no one would ever guessed. Furthermore the actors in the movie do a fantastic job bringing these characters to life. Overall it was a amazing movie and I can't wait for more movies similar to this from Rian."
1137,"Dark comedy, great script, consistent plot with unexpected ending, great cast, Mr. Bond with southern accent was hilarious and hided his character's brilliance under that clumsy accent. They don't make movies like that anymore, so enjoy it!"
1138,"Oddly funny, unpredictable with a well-used star-studded cast."
1139,"The story had something of a (crime) talk-show.
The plot wasn't really a plot, because almost nothing happened except a lot of chatting. It was just boring. That's why I only give 4/10."
1140,"I was greatly underwhelmed by the film after reading so many highly positive reviews. Most of the actors are favorites of mine too, and they did what was expected of them, valiantly. But to me, the plot was tedious and the outcome predictable. I am sorry I rented it."
1141,"I liked the cast and set up and I would've rated this movie a lot higher if weren't for two detractions. The biggest being the set up of the apparent murder suicide. The nurse accidentally gives her patient 100mg of morphine through an IV and he miraculously stays conscious for at least 10 minutes while they figure out a plan and execute it. The next criticism is a continuation of the first, the lady is a nurse therefore she would easily know something is in fact a miss since the guy stays conscious after the so called massive overdose. The movie is built upon this flimsy premise. That out of the way I did enjoy the ending as I didn't see it coming. The only other complaint was that the movie starts out rather slow going."
1142,I've been waiting to see this movie due to the critics saying it was good. It is pretty interesting at first but then the twist kind of ruins the fun.
1143,"Rian Johnson's Knives Out is quite hard to admire as an adult. If only this movie were to be targeted for younger audiences, it would've been a hit. But I wouldn't blame him. His directing skills are remarkable. But his story writing needs more work"
1144,"Well, well, well... we have an engaging murder mystery movie featuring a spectacular ensemble (led by Daniel Craig & Christopher Plummer) in our hands. The character played by Ana de Armas (who I remember from Knock! Knock!, War Dogs & BR 2049) is what drives the film forward to captivating twists and turns. A movie like Knives Out is best savoured by not having read the one-line-plot or seen the trailer.The first act, in my opinion, is what particularly stands out. Private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is investigating the supposed murder of wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey. Writer-director Rian Johnson carefully toys around the audience with a few leads, a few red herrings, and even a few shots that reveal more than what they're supposed to (a second watch will prove this right). Yet, it's Rian's eye for detailing that mostly works in the case of Knives Out. Craig is fantastic (as always) and his appearances out of the blue in certain scenes were a treat to watch.While Knives Out is a modern whodunnit, it really evokes the feels of reading an Agatha Christie mystery novel. As each page turns, you know you're one step closer to finding out who was behind the ghastly crime (or you don't, until the very last page). The mansion and its surroundings provided the right amount of intrigue for a storyline such as this. The score by Nathan Johnson also added an extra layer of obscurity to the proceedings. Steve Yedlin, a frequent Rian Johnson collaborator, captures the wintry vibes of Massachusetts perfectly.Knives Out is probably one of my favorite films of 2019 owing to two reasons: a) I totally dig murder mysteries b) Knives Out is astonishingly well-written and made. You may not be completely blown away by the climax twist, but the way the film builds up to it is impressive. Ana de Armas is going to have a lot of good-to-great directors approaching her shortly."
1145,"I already wrote a review and obviously I like this movie very much, but I wrote this second on to mention something that I've been saying for some time now, what exactly does it take to please some people? Are some people in search of the ultimate movie because honestly I truly understand to each their own but time and time again I come across ratings of movies by some people that seem to mystify me. I'm absolutely convinced that some people must be near impossible to please, that's all I can gather from the negative reviews I see of good movies, they're the kind of people who'll hit the lottery and then complain about it, I know that sounds impossible right but apparently not so for some people."
1146,"I kept waiting for the twist, the surprise, the OMG moment. It never came. Daniel Craig's silly southern accent combined with the lackluster characters and predictable story it's really just an hour and a half of who-the-hell-cares with a disappointing ending."
1147,"Didn't like the acting. Watched it for about half an hour, that was enough. Slow and borring."
1148,"My wife describes it as the best ""Neo-Noir"" movie. The mystery remains to the very in and just when you figure you have it; here comes another twist. It was fun throughout the entire movie. Acting was superb by all characters. It is a sleeper for us and we will be recommending it to all our friends."
1149,"I first tried watching the movie without subtitles, it was in English so why would I need subtitles .I'll tell you why... you have Daniel Craig's character trying and failing miserably at speaking in a southern U.S. accent. Every other word is a strange mumble.(Mr Craig is British)
Aside from this very poor casting choice, the film was very enjoyable."
1150,"I had no expectation about the movie whatsoever except seeing Chris Evans play a douchy rich boy compared to his knightly Captain America. The cast alongside him adds even more attraction to the motion picture.Throughout the story you feel safe and pleasant and get the vibes of actually being present in the manor, however, right away we get a weird Deus ex machina for the future use that is kind of overused to my disappointment.The style of setting up the mystery is not innovative but still fun to watch. The mannerisms of the characters suit them well making us like the good guys and sense disgust for others. The tones give quite a contrast and the atmosphere once again puts the plot holes in the shadow.I would say that it is worth checking out as a nice movie in the end of the day. No pressure, no intense mind work only peaceful flow of the story relaxing you after all the busy hours you had."
1151,"Why cast Daniel Craig as PI, with a,southern accent??
More interested in house used as,background for movie..
Weird movie...boring rates this 30%..out of possible 109."
1152,"I have some points
1)) good movie after all of these disappointing movies last year
2)) the story building line was very good until we reached last 30 minutes .. Like Daniel Craig said there is a big hole ((the movie like a donut there is something missing))
3)) I think it's a good point that we didn't expect the murder it was blury but we have some lines to uncover him but we couldn't discover him
4)) about comedy side I think there is no comedy in hall movie
5)) what a great acting from Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig
6)) I think that why Katherine langford exists its just cause she is pretty and for advertising
7)) I think it's a play from the grandfather to teach his family lesson and to give message against racismAfter all
I have watched a lot of crime movies and series actually its my favorite type .. And this experience tells that I have a good judgment on this type of movies
Thanks for your time hope you liked it"
1153,"This film has a star-studded cast and a plot that was classic and easy to execute. Chris Evans, Daniel Craig, Jaime Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon starred as an estranged and eccentric family coming together for the reading of the patriarch's will. His nurse and friend, Marta, is left the majority of his worldly possessions, and amidst the outrage of his family and the police investigation regarding his untimely death, there is intrigue abound. Marta is technically the protagonist, but she is more of a vehicle for the plot to develop than a player in the game. She is passive in her fate, and her redeeming quality is her niceness. This is shoved down the throat of the audience so many times in literal phrasing that it becomes distasteful and almost suspicious. If you have to TELL us she is nice, then there is a failure to show us, and it is a missed opportunity. As we see the events of the fatal night play out from many different perspectives, it becomes clear that even her hand in Harlan (the patriarchs) death was accidental and passive. Overall, a fun experience, akin to a game of clue, but rather lackluster in the character category."
1154,"Sure It wasn't the best movie and there were parts that could have been done better, but it also wasn't a bad one (like lots of people are saying with one star reviews). Far from it. I quite enjoyed it and would definitely recommend seeing it"
1155,"This was interesting to look at. I was very happy with the way of filming and plot, but the director was not able to mix good soundtracks for the events of the movie. In general, the work was good but it would be better than it was"
1156,"The trailer almost put me off watching this but I'm glad a gave it a chance, even when you've figured out who the culprit is, the film keeps you gripped to find out why. Not the greatest who done it but certainly not the worst. A good solid film worth anyone's time. The only thing I didn't like was Daniel Craig's dodgy accent but that's just a personal opinion. In a day and age where all Hollywood seems to do is remake old movies this is a refreshing change. People who won't watch this because of TLJ need to get over it and give this a chance, you'll be pleasantly surprised."
1157,"This film is a mystery lovers dream. Fantastic scenario. Great story and clever storytelling. Every character has a purpose and a motive. They convince you that it is one person then they completely baffle you with other perspectives. The director was very clever with the direction of the film. This film was also supported by an amazing cast. Daniel Craig,Chris Evans,Jamie Lee Curtis and an amazing Frank oz cameo appearance. 9/10 great mystery whodunit film"
1158,"Great tongue-in-cheek ""whodunit"" mystery movie. I'm not a Daniel Craig fan AT ALL, but he did a superb job. (Somewhat like Tommy Lee Jones' character in The Fugitive.) I would recommend this movie to absolutely anyone!"
1159,"Honestly the movie wasn't that hard to predict but still, it's a great movie, it's super fun, it has comedy, it has tense moments, great performances especially from Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas that I think that deserves a nomination to Best supporting actress, in short there is a mix of factors that make this movie one of the best of 2019, I don't know if it will get a Best Picture nomination, but in my opinion it deserves it."
1160,"Daniel Craig please never do an accent like you did in this movie ever again! I'd rather watch Clue than this new age movie. It's never ending! The cast is well known but the script....not that interesting. Once again, Daniel Craig, please don't use that accent in another movie again."
1161,"My daughter and I, after seeing ""Knives Out"" (on Saturday, Dec 7th) both believe it to be the movie of the year! Incomparable writing & exquisite acting by this superstar cast! Well deserved GG noms - with (most certainly) more awards to come. A must see!"
1162,"For me, a bit too much of a hybrid. Started off as a quirky black comedy, with nicely observed characters, then morphed into a more straightforward 'Whodunnit.' Left less than satisfied. But lovely performances."
1163,"This is my kind of murder mystery; classy, funny, and a lot more talking with witnesses than examining police evidence with phony technology (ALA CSI: ""Zoom in on that out of focus license plate. Great, and now: enhance the image.""). This film feels like a story about Hercule Poirot, C. Auguste Dupin, or Sherlock Holmes, and the case is just as twisty and thrilling as any of the cases that might've turned between the pages of some renowned literary novel by Christie, Poe, or Doyle, but not only is the storyline intelligent, it also says something about the state of the American country, it gives us an eclectic cast of suspects, and it's one of the more fun movie-going experiences I've had this year. ""Knives Out"" is a treat for fans of detective fiction, but it is not at all what you would think."
1164,"""Knives out"" would have been an excellent movie if there was tighter editing, better acting from the supporting cast and Daniel Craig not using that stupid and goofy accent throughout the movie.Although his acting was spot on he really reduced the overall quality of the film with his senseless accent.
However the star of this motion picture was Ana de Armas who was brilliant and was the backbone of this movie.
Everyone else's acting was way below average.
It was a joy to watch a good ""Whodunit"" after such a long long long time
7/10"
1165,Funny and fun! I guessed the ending (plus the guys name in RANSOM I mean COME ON!) but I still had fun through the twists and turns and fun cast! A great modern life lesson is in there too. They touched current topics like politics and being independent and what being a decent person means.
1166,"A lot of people had issues with Star Wars: The Last Jedi but I absolutely loved it. Then again, I've rated Rian Johnson since he came onto the scene with Brick and later followed up with a smart science fiction thriller in Looper. Knives Out by trailer didn't look lik anything amazing although a ""whodunnit?"" is always fun. Reviews seemed very positive and it is all warranted. This one comes with a unique way of solving the crime and its humor and ensemble cast make for an entertaining watch.
The film is about the death of a very wealthy novelist. Initially, his death is deemed to be a suicide but a renown detective with a bizarre southern accent named Benoit Blanc is suspicious and thinks that the man was murdered by his family. His family members appear to be hiding more than they seem and clues come one by one. However, its not a simple case of murder and the circumstances leading to the death are very unique and no as forward as it seems. Interestingly enough, Ana de Armas takes a huge role here as a lead character.
I think the film should be commended for its storytelling. Its not like other films where you have to wait till the end to make your decision on who the culprit was. In a way the film is more transparent than that but also still very elusive. The hallmark of a good film is how its just engaging throughout through a sharply written script that thrives on its humor and call backs to films of the past in the same genre. I loved seeing de Armas in a lead role. Wanted to see a lot more of her ever since Knock Knock. Daniel Craig also turns in a memorable performance.
This is definitely worth a watch also for its truly great ensemble cast. None of the family are particularly likeable and its supposed to be that way. Whatever grudges you may have had against Johnson for The Last Jedi should be freshly bowled over because Knives Out is a smartly entertaining film that is capping of a rather great year in film. Impressive stuff.
8/10"
1167,"If you've ever been caught up with a Will dispute then you'll recognize the characters in this one. All entitled, despicable, small minded and always, always, ALWAYS bickering. Sounds like a family reunion to me!
As a murder mystery this is a bit slow on the start with Daniel Craig playing the small time country lawy--- errrrr detective Benoit Blanc who was hired to solve the case.
Some decent twists and turns, a juicy red herring and good intentions that pave the way to hell.
It comes with a really big finish saving the best for the last. Overall this one it fun with very grounded family dynamics considering the type of family this is."
1168,"This movie is fun, I enjoyed it a lot and I wasn't too sure I would based off the negative reviews I read on imdb. The movie kept me wondering the entire time."
1169,Overall it's a good movie and a cool murder mystery but the twist wasn't very impressive. I expected more from it. Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas delivered the best performances.
1170,"I love Daniel Craig. I did not love him in this movie. As a Southerner with a thick accent, I really resent a Brit trying to use a southern accent. Another issue is a mystery without surprises. The plot was a little predictable and irritating."
1171,"First of all, I enjoyed the film. Loved the music and the shots. The beginning part was great, with all the shots of the house (love the house) and slowly moving up to the important scene. If you are looking for a light, entertaining film, this is a good choice. Just don't take it as a sophisticated mystery that requires your logical reasoning.
So the three stars off is because I'm a big fan of Agatha Christine, and this story is not strong enough to be called a murder mystery for me. When I see the beginning: murder inside a house with fixed suspects, questioning with each person and finding holes in their words, they just shouts Agatha to me. But then what? All threads lead to our main character Marta. Other characters seems to just stand there, fighting each other, fighting against the will. What's their role in this murder mystery? Their verdicts, or just overall story, contributed almost nothing to the mystery, except for family drama. The whole movie just feels like Marta, Ransom, and other family members, what's the fun in guessing the murderer then?
Then there's our victim. I have no idea why someone would want to leave his fortune to his nurse, or slice his own throat for her. I mean yes, they have good relationships, and he wanted his family to do their own things instead of relying on his fortune. But he can always donate, right? How close he has to feel towards Marta to leave all his fortune to her and believe she could do the right thing? Furthermore, how close their relationship has to be to let him decide to slice his throat just to cover up for his nurse? I mean that's some painful way of death. And do people commit suicide by slicing their throat? If Harlan wants to cover for Marta, surly he would choose a method looking more like a suicide, like cutting the wrist? stab into his chest? I don't know. Anyway Harlan is waaay too good to Marta, in a way beyond my normal senses.
Lastly, the twist in the end was good, but... the whole story could have ended if they saw the surveillance camera or footprints on the muddy path. I mean Ransom didn't even try to cover it up. It's just coincidence both of them went through the same path. There are way too many coincidences in this story, including this, and the double mixing up bottles, the old lady who just happened to sit by the window that faces the secret path. If Marta chose a different way of creating alibi, Ransom would have been spotted the first day of our detective's investigation. So in short, a mystery that could have been solved early on if not for an coincidence.
This film could have been my favorite of the year. I mean the genre, the beautiful house, my favorite detective style, and all the good actors, but in the end I went out of the theater feeling mixed. I guess great anticipation usually comes with great disappointment..."
1172,"Looking at the cast and trailer, I was really looking forward to this. Had never heard of the director before, so open minded. Basic idea was promising, but it just wasn't that funny! One person in the cinema clearly found it hilarious (maybe that was the director?)
I found it too long and kept waiting for a spark to ignite it. That didn't happen but two hours looking at Daniel Craig isn't entirely time wasted!"
1173,"Masterful work, this is my second favorite movie of 2019, only after Parasite. Rian Johnson has cemented himself as one of the most interesting directors working today and earned my full attention for his future works.Knives Out is not only the best of its kind, it also brought fresh new takes on how to approach the whodunit genre. The story is intriguing and the pacing is near perfect. As expected from this amazing cast, the acting is good to great through and through, with one of the best performances of 2019 from Daniel Craig. Extremely happy for Ana because thanks to Blade Runner 2049 and this, she's very much on her way to be a superstar. Rian once again bathed his film in stylistic cinematography, making it one more cut above other movies. I can keep on talking about the tight writing, the atmospheric score, the dynamic camerawork, the non-stop twists and turns, but I suggest you go and see this brilliant piece of art yourself."
1174,"Really enjoyed the film. great cast, great characters. Nice plot twists novel approach. Masterfully directed, well edited giving all the ensemble characters they can get their teeth into. What starts as a simple murder mystery soon turns when us as viewers get all the information we need right at the start of the film.
Spoilers bit, sorry;🙏
I did think it was a bit heavy handed the way none of the family knew the country Marta was from leading us to the fact although they keep telling her she is part of the family very few know even the most basic details about her life.
Over all I thought it was a fantastic ride, go see it, enjoy it and avoid the haters. Cheers."
1175,Funny. when you think you got it figured theres always a little more. This is definitely worth the watch
1176,"I haven't been this entertained at a movie this year..brilliant writing,hilarious,amazing acting a brilliant whodunnit movie everyone needs to go see..I see rian Johnson winning an Oscar and golden globe for this movie..can't praise it enough"
1177,"The film takes the whodunnit and spins it on its head, giving you that answer in the first fifteen minutes. So you think it's now a whydunnit And yet it remains a whodunnit. And a whydunnit.
Lovely performances by the entire cast. But it's so cool that in a place like Hollywood, such a stellar cast can come together to play roles while a newcomer takes the lead role. Doesn't happen in India.
Nice to see Daniel Craig out of the Bond franchise every now and then. Along with Captain America.
Tight edit. Tight sound. Beautifully shot.
Tight script. Well made film."
1178,"If you like a good old fashioned whodunnit then this is for you, quite simply
spellbinding great acting and a clever plot ! how the cinema should be ! Bravo"
1179,"GRADE: BTHIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: An highly entertaining murder mystery that harks back to an early time and succeeds as a delightful tribute to the classic whodunnit genre.JIM'S REVIEW: Knives Out is a nifty little murder mystery that pays homage to the once popular whodunnit genre. Rian Johnson assembles a fine cast of actors and writes his carefully plotted screenplay to masterful effect. Any armchair detective or moviegoer should enjoy this intriguing diversion.Mr. Johnson sets up his mystery in an elegant old mansion, the home of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a successful mystery writer who sets the plot in motion on his 85th birthday celebration by agitating family members with secrets and scandals afoot. His demise seems like a foregone conclusion with many of his children and their offsprings all having enough anger and motives to do the old fellow in.The main suspects and possible heirs to the family fortune include: Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), Harlan's eldest daughter, and her husband, Richard (Don Johnson), Harlan's youngest son, Walt (Michael Shannon), who is in charge of his father's publishing house, and Joni (Toni Collette), Harlan's free-spirited daughter-in-law. Also brought into the fray are Harlan's spoiled grandson with the unfortunate nickname, Ransom (Chris Evans), Meg (Katherine Langford) and Jacob (Jaeden Martell), two more of Harlan's grandchildren, and Marta (Ana de Armas), his loyal and loving nurse who cannot tell a lie. Along with the local police team investigating the case, Detective Lieutenant Elliot (Lakeith Stanfield) and Trooper Wagner (Noah Segan), is super sleuth and private detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). The cast is uniformly strong, and watching them inhabit their roles is a particular pleasure, with Mr.Plummer, Ms. de Armas, and a wonderful Mr. Craig as stand-outs.Knives Out keeps one guessing as all good mystery should do and while it stays within the Thrombey home, the story remains true to its roots. But, in the third act, the film unwisely opens up its atmospheric setting and loses some of its cherished momentum with an unexciting car chase sequence, some unnecessary plot twists, and a slightly disappointing ending.Still, Mr. Johnson's solidly uses style and ingenuity in his overall construction of his whodunnit and directs with flair. This is especially true when he incorporates his visual images to reveal the true goings-on of the events in question which directly contradicts the suspect's alibis. The audience seems to get the upper hand before the team of detectives start their deductions, making the story more complex and entertaining.Knives Out is a clever nostalgic send-up of the old murder mystery whodunnit done well. This Clue-like stage has been set for an old-fashioned murder and the mystery formula remains intact. Yes, this modern update is a welcome reimagining of the classic whodunnit and has enough charm and intelligence that would make Dame Agatha proud. Sleuth on!"
1180,"Just saw the AMC advanced screening of this film, and it was extremely well done! The story did start off kinda slow, but it picks up quick. The acting is better than expected even with such a talented cast, and it was well written, although it did feel like Toni Collette was trying too hard. There was no ""mcguffin"", no surprise character introductions in the third act, and everything was up front at all times. There was no ""secret"" piece of information introduced at the last minute that would give everything away. The ending caught me off guard not so much because of the who, but for the how of it...All in all, it is a brilliant mystery that balanced story, plot, and humor without compromising on quality. Daniel Craig could very well have another hit franchise on his hands if they were to create additional cases for him to solve. This is provided that the same quality in terms of writing and story is adhered too."
1181,"I was able to see an early access screening of this, and it was amazing! It is so layered and unpredictable, with a great cast and great directing. Go see this when you can!"
1182,"This is the type of movie you say when someone asks you for a recommendation because it is for everyone( movie lovers and casual viewers)
In the sea of sequels, reboots , ... this is truly a breath of fresh air.
I haven't been so entertained in cinema for a long time.
Suberb intelligent script( Oscar nom is coming) and brilliant actors make this a must watch for everyone.
p.s. there are really interesting techniques, some seen for the first time or rarely in movie history"
1183,"When I saw the preview, I thought it would be good. It is great. Old fashioned WHO DONE IT. With great actors."
1184,"This was such a fun whodunnit that was pretty hilarious and well acted. Chris Evans and Ana De Armas bring such powerhouse performances in this film. The dialogue is witty and well written, there are twists and turns that I did not see coming. I think Rian Johnson is not as clever as he thinks he is, the script is solid and pretty tight, but in the end it's nothing different from what we've already seen before. I suppose that's my biggest issue, I'm not sure I'd say it's a different take on the whodunnit genre like some others have said, because in the end it's just the same old trick. The message and the commentary in this film was pretty obvious, ham fisted, and heavy handed. There are some other elements to the story that were stupid, but other than that it was a thoroughly enjoyable film with an amazing cast, great acting, a solid script, and pretty good directing."
1185,"I saw ""Knives Out"", starring Daniel Craig-the James Bond movies, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo_2011; Chris Evans-the Captain America & Avengers movies, the Fantastic Four movies; Jamie Lee Curtis-the Halloween movies, Christmas With the Kranks; Don Johnson-Django Unchained, Machete; Christopher Plummer-The Man Who Invented Christmas, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_2011 and Ana de Armas-Blade Runner 2049, War Dogs.
This is a murder mystery in the vein of Murder on the Orient Express-it has a lot of celebrities in it. Christopher plays the eccentric millionaire-among other things, he has a chair with knives all over it, looking like it was from Game of Thrones-and he is celebrating his 85th birthday with the whole family coming in for it. Jamie is his daughter, Don is her husband and Chris is their son. There are other family members-and they are all dysfunctional-and Ana is the care giver to Christopher. Ana seems to be the only one that really likes Christopher. During the night, Christopher is found dead-his throat slit with a knife-and it is ruled a suicide. After the funeral, the police show up at the family home with Daniel-a private investigator-and start asking questions. It seems that it might not have been suicide but maybe murder, instead. Everyone is a suspect with a motive.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language, drug material and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.
I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
1186,I saw this at TIFF and thought it was a masterpiece. Someone should show this to the game of thrones guys as a lesson in how to subvert expectations properly. Its a pity to see such a low score due to the star wars kids being pissy over a 2 year old movie and taking it out here. I hope it becomes a franchise of detective movies.
1187,"So first I'll start off by saying this is spoiler free! With that said, I loved it, great story, pace, and overall acting! I thought the movie was going to be one way, based on the promotional material, but I was mistaken. The movie isn't the typical whodunit but it is rather a beautiful twist to the genre. What I loved about Knives Out was its finely crafted and very thought out storytelling, lots of surprises with a strong sense of mystery. I must say Daniel Craig stole the show, but for me everyone was brilliant. The movie had great charm about it, but the ending really helped bring the whole movie together. My only real critique is the legality of the final outcome, but I'm no detective (you'll know what I mean when you see it). I highly recommend this film and would love to see it again to catch more my second go of it! Go see Knives Out, you surely won't be disap""pointed!"""
1188,"If u have watched colombo,murder she wrote,mrs marple,diagnosis murder and any other crappy who dunnits then u have already seen this.come on guys bring some original movies out.waste of time."
1189,I went into this movie expecting a murder mystery and came out wondering why I went to this awful movie. The first part was cool until they somewhat revealed how it went down because a maid cannot tell lies. It was not at all exciting or mysterious. James Bond was cool but the other acting was C+ at best. People seem pretty salty at all the low ratings but the low ones are accurate. I can see why someone might give it a 4 or 5 but not a 10.
1190,"After seeing this in the theaters, I couldn't wait to tell everyone about it! It was SO well done! It was like a beautiful tribute/homage to Agatha Christie. She would have absolutely loved this. Everything about this was perfect and had me on the edge of my seat. Daniel Craig was brilliant in this role and I just know he had a blast playing detective. I loved the rest of the cast as well, they were perfectly selected. Jaime Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, Chris Evans, etc. But Ana De Armas gave us such a fantastic and convincing performance which I think deserves some recognition at the Oscars. The director Rian Johnson is absolutely brilliant to come up with this and it's clear that he put so much time and effort into it. I mean there was so much well-executed detail you had to pay attention; something important happens in every scene and you don't want to miss it. I love how each character, no matter how much screen time, had an integral part in the case. It really felt like a classic murder mystery with an even bigger twist. It had just the right amount of drama without coming off too much like a soap opera. The great thing about the ending is that you truly don't see it coming. I had so much fun watching and if there is a book version I'm definitely going to read it. I'd recommend this to anyone. I absolutely loved this film and it's definitely going to win some Oscars!"
1191,"Thanks to Rian Johnson, your script are genius. I mean i was fooled by a movie! The actors was really great, and the script is wonderful. It's a mystery movie, but it has a lot of emotions in one storyline. The spooky atmosphere was so intense, but still have a little comedy on it. And last but not least, this movie told me everything about pure love. And i took a lot of lessons from this lil piece of masterpiece. Well done."
1192,"After getting unnecessary fan-hate after directing The Last Jedi, Rian Johnson returned to the big screen to direct a murder mystery like no other. And I feel like I'm comfortable saying this is close to a crime thriller masterpiece. Filled with earned twists and turns, incredible character depth, meticulous direction, and a wonderful time at the movies for all ages. And if I'm not mistaken, this was Ana de Armas' first true starring role, and she absolutely nailed it. She is a star in the making. If you're able to standout in a cast with Captain America, Laurie Strode, General Zod, and James Bond, throw in legends like Don Johnson & Christopher Plummer, with Toni Collette, LaKeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, and Jaeden Martell, you know you have serious talent. That's how good de Armas is. I can't wait to rewatch this one.9.5/10"
1193,"This is great fun, delivered with humor and a plot that keeps you guessing. Daniel Craig shows he can act as well as save the world."
1194,"Everything I am outlining below on this excellent, old-fashion 2-hour whodunit pertains only to the first hour. Nothing therein should be considered a spoiler if you look at them in the context of what is to come in the second hour. Still, for purists, please do not read on.Enormously successful murder mystery writer Harlan (Christopher Plummer) is found dead lying on the couch in his study, a couple of hours after his 80-something birthday party at his luxurious mansion. Of his three siblings, one son had died years ago leaving behind widow Joni (Toni Collette) with a daughter Meg (Kathrine Langford), a college student. Daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), a very successful businesswoman, is married to Richard (Don Johnson) who has given her a son Ransom (Chris Evans), a cad so irresponsible that he has not even bothered to come to the subsequent funeral. Youngest son Walt (Michael Shannon), married and with a teenage son, is allowed to run the family publishing company but kept on a short leash.Not a family member but treated by all as one is Marta (Ana de Armas) a young nurse hired to look after Harlan. She is a South American immigrant living with a family who, unlike her, is in the country illegally. Alienated by his family members, Harlan considered Marta to be his only friend. While Marta does not live in the mansion, there is a housemaid who does. Completing the ensemble is Harlan's mother at whose age dementia is entirely expected.The case is officially under Lieutenant Elliott (Lakeith Stanfield), who sees nothing more than a suicide of an old man tired of living. Celebrated private investigator Beniot Blanc (Daniel Graig), however, has been hired by a mysterious client to assist the police to see if there is foul play. Four suspects very quick emerge, all with motives clearly revealed at the party, either heard or observed by other people. Walt is fired by his father for incompetence. Toni is found out to have been cheating on the money she claims to be necessary for Meg's college education, which Harlan has been generously funding. He now threatens to cut off the support completely, thereby jeopardising Meg's college education. Against son-in-law Richard, Harlan holds convincing evidence of his cheating on his wife. Finally, Ransom is heard to have had a heated exchange with his grandfather, when he is told that he has been cut out completely in the old man's will. The prime murder suspects, therefore, comprise a son, a daughter-in-law, a son-in-law and a grandson.So far so good. Then comes the first big twist that changes everything. Between the finishing of the party and the time of the murder, various people have heard third big thuds from the study where Marta often plays GO games with Harlan before seeing him to bed. Toni actually knocks on the door which is answered by Harlan who explains that he accidentally knocked down the playboard and there is nothing to worry about. Going into any more details will spoil the fun of viewers, although not necessarily the convoluted plotline.I'll just mention three key things, which the viewers would expect anyway.
1. The will, which obviously is crucial to the death, is read to the family at about the midpoint of the story.
2. The identity of Blanc's mysterious client is not revealed until the very end and has a vital significance.
3. Whether this is indeed a suicide (as the Lieutenant believes it to be), a murder (as Blanc is investigating) or even something else is not disclosed until the very end.The star if the show is de Armas, almost unrecognizable from the computer-created character she plays in ""Blade runner 2049"". Equally unrecognizable, from his Agent 007 persona, is Craig. Both are superb. Plummer has a couple of impressive scenes in flash-backs. Of the other supports, Collette has the strongest role while Curtis is a bit underused. I almost forget Evan, another unrecognizable, not so much in appearance as in person, from his Captain America. All the rest of the cast deliver solid support.Rian Johnson may not be an A-list director but certainly has a core of devoted followers. Critics and viewers unanimously agree that this movie represents his total return to form. After watching this movie, you will understand why."
1195,"Being a big fan of mystery novels and films, I was really looking forward to watching this movie, and was not at all disappointed!
While set in modern times, the film has a really timeless feel to it, similar to the stories by Agatha Christie. While the formula is familiar; rich dysfunctional family living in a big mansion, all with secrets to hide, the twists and turns are quite surprising.
The entire experience is engrossing, and, while the story did not quite go where I initially expected, the ending was great, and actually smart. The whole thing was also really funny at times, adding to the whole entertainment value of murder mysteries.
Daniel Craig, playing detective Benoit Blanc, really goes to town on his role, with a southern 'accent' I never really heard before. Ana de Armas really shines in this movie as well, and the ensemble of great actors playing the eccentric family members all made their screen time memorable.
I highly recommend this movie."
1196,"The movie is not for the average movie goer. The amazing way the movies set up scenes and actions of the character, is not average and not easy to follow. But, the plots and twist are all so well done. The movies valences laughable moments and mysterious drama perfectly. Notability, the most memorable performances go to Chris Evens, Ana De Armes and Daniel Craig. All characters play an importance role- as everything connected and flowed together."
1197,Well this is a bonkers movie. An Agatha Christie country house murder mystery with a great cast of suspects. Daniel Craig is the private Eye helping police find out who killed the rich dad Christopher Plummer. Don Johnson Jamie Lee Curtis Chris Evans Michael Shannon Toni Colette and Chris Evans are the family members in the frame. Ana de Armas is the nurse another suspect who's a ringer for a young Rose Byrne. I enjoyed the twists and turns and ending but some of the cast play it straight while more ham it up which is disconcerting. It certainly doesn't take itself seriously and overall its good fun but Daniel Craig sounding like Kevin Spacey is very creepy!!!
1198,"Benoit Blanc, 'the last of the gentlemen detectives,' is engaged to solve the murder of a famous mystery novelist.A ""who done it"" with a classic feel and a great cast playing a good collection of characters. All the elements of a traditional murder mystery are blended with some nice humour that ranges from clever to bizarre.The blame could have been aimed at a wider range of the characters more squarely. I enjoyed the movie much more up until the reveal; there are some surprises after that but not the anticipated big twist.I liked, 'That was the dumbest car chase.'"
1199,I loved this film. I found it funny well written with some interesting takes on the whodunnit theme. Daniel Craig is hilarious as is his accent. The ensemble cast are excellent. So refreshing to watch a CGI and super hero free movie. I really don't get why people are hating on this film so much. I loved it and I don't even get paid for writing reviews.
1200,"Rian Johnson's ('Star Wars: The Last Jedi') ensemble juggernaut 'Knives Out' is a cutting edge whodunnit with lots of witty one-liners and twists, an underlying political sneer at modern America, and first-rate actors that will both shock and surprise you.As soon as the classical music kicks in with the murder scene draped in fog, you know this is going to be a unique watch for 2019 audiences. What seems to have been a suicide, suddenly becomes a murder investigation on the death of renowned crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), as more and more testimonies don't line up, and private detective Blanc (Daniel Craig) and Lieutenant Elliott (LaKeith Stanfield) suspect foul play. A classic murder mystery turns into a contemporary case of Cluedo that keeps the twists coming, even when it seems like the main secret has been revealed in the first act. When more skeletons seem hidden within Thrombey's manor and his dysfunctional family, that's when the fun really begins.Johnson most recently directed the hated-by-a-huge-percentage-of-fanboys 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' (which I personally adore!), but isn't holding back on his writing skills. As a matter of fact, it seems like he's even louder than ever and that truly pays off. His construction and build up of tension and suspense is astounding. Most of 'Knives Out' takes place in the enormous mansion, which by the way has some of the craziest production design I've seen all year, yet Johnson takes the story far beyond the mansion on a few occasions to bump into the clues the main suspect has been trying to hide from everyone involved.The cast is stupendously incredible. Rambling up such a mix of well known talents with exciting new faces, is a genius combo. Front and centre stands Cuban actress Ana de Armas ('Blade Runner 2049'), as Mr. Harlan Thrombey's caretaker. Showcasing a range of emotions throughout the film, she's certainly the strongest of the cast and an exciting talent that will most definitely have people talking. The caring and emotional Marta Cabrera, is a unique character I haven't seen in a film of this calibre for a while. Her innocent persona evolves through all stages of grief, showing she has a heart while most of the late Mr. Thrombey's family members are vultures with no shame. Johnson has proven many times before how to flesh out his characters, and has done it again.Daniel Craig ('Spectre') and Toni Collette ('Hereditary') surprise as on screen comic relief. It's refreshing to see Craig, who's best known for James Bond, take a different route in his career to prove he's not a one-trick pony. Collette, who at one point channels her Hereditary dinner rant, is a camp riot as daughter-in-law Joni. Everyone is great in their own part, just Jaeden Martell ('It') felt more like a minor plot device and has no place in the whole of the story.'Knives Out' is a hoot of a film! Cuts right into the action and slices through two hours of giggles, shocks and spins. This might not be for everyone, Johnson has quite the outspoken opinion on racism, political standpoints and what's right and wrong, and might challenge those who don't agree with a more evolved point of view on humanity. The film is most of all engaging, and Johnson is just the right guy to make one the most entertaining films of the year.Originally published on into:screens"
1201,"My husband hadn't heard of this movie (outside what I told him) but knew I wanted to see it and surprised me with Early Release tickets. We went last night and it was just a fun time at the movies and a happy diversion from all the holiday prep we've been doing. Don't regret going at all (like you do with some movies).Knives Out recalls the days of the black and white PI movies and the television shows of the 70s and 80s, while bringing the genre firmly into the modern age.It felt formulaic at times. That said, there were enough surprises to make you laugh, think, or even cringe and that keeps it from being too predictable! We were delightfully surprised that we couldn't figure it out completely. As one reviewer said, the tie-up wasn't quite a surprise (the Who) but the rest (how it all comes together) had some elements we were surprised about.It walks the line between brilliant new Whodunit and tongue-in-cheek throwback parody. There are enough references to previous renowned PIs (without shoving them in your face) to make it feel almost a parody. Especially with quips like, ""CSI KFC"". Yet, they have created a unique Whodunit in wonderful style that mostly keeps you interested.There were points (especially in the middle/middle-end) where I felt it dragged a bit, but it picked up again quickly and we were drawn back into the story almost as soon as I realized I was getting restless.I personally think the actors were the best part of the whole thing. I realize they are actors and this is their job, but it seemed like they were having a ball with their typecast/stereotyped characters. Most notably, Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. It was pure joy watching them enjoying their roles so much. You could feel their fun coming off the screen. It didn't hurt that these are roles we don't relate to these gentlemen often so it was such delicious fun to watch. (Seriously, good-guy Captain America to spoiled Trust Fund Playboy? He had so much fun with it.)Overall, it probably won't end up in my top 10 favorite movies. At the same time, if it's on, I'd probably watch it again and again."
1202,"I got a chance to watch Knives Out at an early screening this week. And I am so glad I was able to go, because it was one of the best movies I've seen this year. (And that's without my bias towards coming-of-age stories)Rian Johnson writes and directs this movie, and it's such a great job from him all around. You can tell this was written the way good mysteries are supposed to be written - backwards. There are so many good twists and turns that reference things happening earlier in the movie. It's the type of mystery that the viewer can solve, if you're paying attention. And on top of that, it manages to be absolutely hilarious the entire time. The humor is witty. The mystery is a modern take on a old genre. It breaks a few tropes to find it's own path. And it's just an amazing journey.If I start listing actors and actresses who give good performances, you'll just wind up seeing the entire cast list. Seriously, the cast includes Daniel Craig, Katherine Langford, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Lakeith Stanfield, Michael Shannon, Christopher Plummer, and others. And every performance is top notch. Nothing feels out of character. Every character has distinct traits. Every actor and actress understands their character and works towards that. The emotion is real. The expressions are real. It deserves all of the praise it gets.This movie is an event. Take your friends and your family to this movie and I can all but guarantee you will enjoy this movie."
1203,I wanted to see this movie since the very first trailer.everyone involved did an excellent job.sooooooooo many oh sh#t moments in this film.I don't want to spoil it just go see it asap👌
1204,Daniel Craig steels the screen in this witty Whodunnit that most likely the critics will hate but what do they know.Daniel plays this Quirky Detective Benoit Blanc with what I would say is to applomb with a deep Southern accent who is assisting the local law enforcement in the investigation of the murder of a well known mystery writer. With a supporting cast of Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson it will keep you guessing till the end if the police or Blanc will get to bottom of their joint investigation.Me thinks if this is successful then it's a green light to see Daniel as Detectivie Benoit Blanc again!
1205,"Here we have-again- the perfect example of a great film being undermined by haters who regard the flm from the perspective of his work on the Star Wars franchise. Let's get this out of the way and let me make clear that the only good parts of the franchise-according to me-are the original trilogy with Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. So I presume that the lowest ratings here were from the SW fan community. ""Knives out"" turns out to be a mix of ""The Royal Tannenbaums"" and ""Hercule Poirot's Christmas"". Just like Meghan Markle who's in for a lifetime of unnecessary comparisons with Diana, you'll inevitably-if subconsciously- compare Craig to David Suchet. Here we have a rich patriarch in his mansion cramped full with all sorts of exotic paraphernalia; a dysfunctional family, each with his own motif to do away with Dad. He is brilliantly portrayed by Christopher Plummer, determined and clear-minded even in the face of his own demise. The only one who seems to genuinely care for him is his immigrant nurse Marta Cabrera, and after the will is read, it turns into a witch-hunt against the unexpected beneficiary of Harlan's fortune. There are delightful details, like the ornamental assemblage of knives in the background of the chair in which members of the family are seated during the questioning. There's Benoit Blanc , a dapper detective on his own quest for the culprit. He's played by Daniel Craig who clearly enjoys showing us his capability for comedy and something beyond James Bond. Cabrera's inability to tell a lie without throwing up is at once brilliant and cliche, but her overall performance shines throughout the whole film-not that she lacks in serious adversaries, like the larger-than-life Jamie Lee Curtis, a charismatic businesswoman who proudly exclaims she ""built her business from the ground up"", which her son Ransom (a handsome and funny Chris Evans) dismisses as a million-dollar loan from Grandpa (a subtle nod to Trump). Harlan's attempt to discredit his flesh and blood as blood-sucking losers is also a challenge for the the viewer-albeit not a really difficult one, but that's not really the point here. The mystery is like a baklava, layered in parallel mysteries to be deciphered. Daniel Craig isn't David Suchet-but on the other hand-he doesn't attempt it anyway, and we can see that he did succeed to build an autonomous, authentic persona, admittedly with a much more pronounced inclination to humor. Which is definitely a good thing. The perfect example of this is a scene where he informs Ransom that his ""ancestral"" family home was in reality purchased by Grandpa in the 1980s. ""Knives Out"" is definitely value for money, whatever the haters say. Let's hope more directors will tap into whodunnits. Not just because I have a soft spot for Poirot and Sherlock.Don't believe the haters!"
1206,Not sure why I went in with low expectations but wow this movie really impressed me. It had everything and was one of the best if it's kind in a long time
1207,More HOLLYWEIRD nonsense. Just a boring tedious movie. Then the fake ratings lol. Always love that. But this time you read all the reviews and they are ones and twos which are correct. But it still has an 8 rating lmao. Typical liberal nonsense. We get it you clowns own the voting booths. Fraud everywhere. Save us
1208,This was a heavy-handed waste of time and waste of film. The cast look lost and the dialog literally gets on your nerves. Couldn't stand any of the characters and the overt messages were annoying as can be. Avoid this garbage if you can.
1209,This was such a good movie. I can assure you that you'll enjoy it.
1210,What a phenomenal movie! Everything from the visual effects to the music just made this movie move fluently. I absolutely loved the tactics from the detectives. The casting was also well done as it made myself and the audience to never look away. This was an (A) performance!
1211,"Rain Johnson is a mega talent. This film proves the immutability of a well written, tight script."
1212,"Really fun movie, always keeps you guessing. Masterfully acted. Daniel Craig is surprisingly hilarious. Well shot and the jokes we'll placed."
1213,"Daniel Craig leads an absolute rock-star cast in this classic who-done-it film. Nothing really makes Knives Out unique when compared to it's murder mystery peers, but it just performs so much better. This is attributed to it's solid pacing in the first 2 acts, it's phenomenal acting, and it's fairly cheery attitude. Knives Out is one that the whole family can follow and enjoy."
1214,"I was convinced (until the housekeeper was murdered) that the victim was still alive and had somehow faked his death in order to get material for his next murder mystery novel because he suffered from writer's block. LOL. That said, I was disappointed that there wasn't a little more humor. Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson have decent comedic timing that largely went untapped. The storyline would have been more interesting had one of the ladies been the guilty party. This also would have made for more interesting dialogue."
1215,"""Clue"" meets ""Peyton Place."" Daniel Craig's character reminded me of Steve Carrel in ""The Office"" when they played the murder mystery game. Marta is a refugee from ""Arrested Development."" Impossible to follow. Silly without being funny. Serious without being dramatic."
1216,"Profitable movie for the studios. Just market and pay actors to sit in a house... so studios say it's Fantastic and get people to pay for it and the sequel.Weak writing specifically:
Predictable ending. This was a mystery?
Humor fell flat for me so wasn't a comedy
the political statements were too muted so not intellectual
Not enough character depth to care about the outcomeI really don't understand the high reviews. Bots maybe? After watching it I felt like my time wasn't well spent. Good for a plane/train ride, not at home when you have other options."
1217,"Well shot, well acted, on the surface fun and exciting.But the plot falls apart on reflection.Too many plot hole and coincidences. Unrealistic family dynamics. Too much Social Justice. Not enough real justice.Mostly just an interesting fantasy ""concept"" meant to make certain minded people feel good, with no real story or depth."
1218,"Surprised at level of reviews here. A very strong cast and production values are the highlights. However, the plot is at the level of ""Murder she wrote"", the suspense level does not even approach Scooby Doo, and the murder reveal is as anti-climactic as an episode of Columbo (where after all the killer is known from the start). But all of these have a structure that grabs you, and keeps you intrigued. The sleuth played by Daniel Craig is a cross between Sherlock Holmes, Columbo and Col. Saunders. The side kick cops are cardboard cutouts. Many of the most interesting characters (ie older and better actors) became redundant early on. Like a tired game of Cluedo, I lost interest half way through and I was checking how much was left towards the end."
1219,"It tries to be an intelligent movie by failed miserably. It started off really interesting however the the whole plot just went down the gutter. Not worth your time, honestly."
1220,This is a well written and acted movie. You will not be disappointed with it if you like good films. Ignore the haters (who no doubt all think The Big Bang Theory is a good TV show).
1221,I thought this movie was supposed to be a mystery comedy. The only mystery was why it was made and the only comedy was Daniel Craig's unnecessary half hearted attempt at a southern accent. Having a plot in which not a single character has any resemblance to an actual human being is not funny - it's just stupid and boring. The horrible dim yellow green lighting and art direction throughout hurt my eyes. And one last thing not mentioned by any reviewers who either favoured or like me hated this waste of electrons - the accompanying score was the most unimaginative generic movie score I've ever heard.
1222,"Had high hopes for this one, seemed like a fun cast in a murder mystery, but not only was the main plot a bit off (spoiler warning), it was really all based on a misunderstanding that caused the the poor heir to kill himself. There was indeed ill intent, but in the end it didn't seem to matter that the young protagonist did not check the label, and thereby confusing the old man's into his demise. I'm sorry, but that is just ridiculous. All characters were stereotypes, and beyond a few exceptions like Don Johnson, they were all easily disposable. No one unfortunately more so than the lead, who although relatable and sweet lacked any opportunities to show her acting skills beyond the deer in the headlight look. Daniel Craig was admittedly amusing, but over-acting ad nausea comes to mind.Sometimes you can tell very early on that a movie is pretentious and nonsensical, I should have heeded my own advice and cut my losses while i was ahead. The minor twist we all knew was coming was not worth the wait."
1223,"This movie is one of the worst crime movies I have ever seen, I could predict every aspect of the movie and I didn't feel any empathy for any of the characters even though Ana de Armas did a good job, but the movie in itself is just bad and I can't understand why this movie has such a high rating, just have a brain and you know the whole movie before you watch it, it's SO PREDICTABLE!!!!!! BAD MOVIE"
1224,Amazing and perfect and amazing and beautiful and fantastic and interesting
1225,"This is one of those movies that you would enjoy watching only once. Kinda felt like i was reading a children's criminal-mystery book. Of course the visuals and colors are nice . But again , wouldn't watch it again even if I didn't have anything else to watch."
1226,...becomes agenda driven. A rare whodunnit movie where you know what happened early in the film and then wait to see if they get away with it. Problem is that after the reveal it turns into an agenda movie about immigration that works...but isn't what the audience really wanted. The guilty party is obvious in today's world but by the time you get that reveal...you no longer cared about whodunnit.
1227,"Despite a reference to the ""Clue Board"" by one of the officers in this movie, it really is nothing like the original movie despite the theme being somewhat the same. Yes there are suspects, a murder, police officers, random events and a lot to think about. The story is a pretty decent one but I feel the last part of the movie just took too many turns.Daniel Craig's American accent is also as unbearable as they get and he probably talks the most in the movie.Intriguing and mysterious at times and even fun but wasn't a big fan of the way it all turned out. Super weird at times. I had a gut feeling I wouldn't be a huge fan after only 5 minutes."
1228,"I was so excited to watch this movie since I'm a big fan of murder mysteries and ended up dissapointed. Characters are way too unlikable, very bad acting from the main girl, i was even dissapointed by Daniel Craig's performance. Still, the last scene was def the worst part of the whole movie, LOL."
1229,"Take almost every Agatha Christie book and put em to getjer (Especially murder on the orient, And Then there where none) and youve got this great who done it film. I think the only thing that bugged me was Craigs HORRIBLE accent. It felt so put on. Other then that its great"
1230,"First of all, ana de armas acting was perfect & of course the legend "" daniel craig ""
Recommend you to watch🔥"
1231,"Fantastic work. Great plot twists. Good acting and costumes.
Scored above 7 because of the twists at the end. Didn't score a 10 because there was no enigmatic / legendary actor /actress"
1232,The plot is so interesting that i could not keep my eyes off the screen. Really liked the twists and turns. This is definitely a must watch.
1233,"Solid script, more than 10 characters are outstanding, all kinds of details and matting need two brush to all Get;What's even more rare is that there is a sense of irony above such a tight script, and a political core below, especially after the second act, when the suspense is over and the political satire begins to dominate the tone, which elevates the film to another level of brilliance.Rian Johnson's directorial skills are still extraordinary, and the cast is blinding."
1234,"Honestly 6/10 is pretty damn generous. This is one of the most predictable murder mysteries I have ever seen, which in itself is bad enough as the main point of a mystery is to have twists and unexpected reveals. There weren't really any likable characters and it was difficult to root for anyone, even the main character. The barfing thing cheapened the whole experience and the role it played in the plot was painfully obvious each time. The attempt at humour was off-putting in its carelessness and lack of finesse; t genuinely felt at times like the script had been written by a child. The stylistic aesthetics and star-studded cast certainly draw you in and the score does its best to captivate your imagination, but none of these elements could drown out the sheer mediocrity of the storytelling, the weak and lackluster plot and the almost pitiful attempt at creating 'mystery'. There were little moments here and there that were decent and at times it seemed like there was potential but sadly the result was seriously underwhelming and unmemorable."
1235,Nice movie best movie seen ever i recommed everyone tyo see this movie
1236,A very Interested and very good movie and I like it and suggest to people to watch it
1237,"...and his explanation lasts over half an hour!!
In case you weren't sure whodunnit, and why, Detective Daniel Craig explains it for you in the end. In detail. In loooong detail. The final scene where'd he recaps and summarizes it all for the audience lasts over half an hour!!"
1238,"I have seen good trailers for what turned out to be lousy films, but this one was accurate. It looked mediocre and stayed that way. It's too bad, since we don't get too many old-fashioned mysteries on the big screen.Knives Out isn't garbage. I gave it an extra star for the decent cast, another for the nice scenery, and one more for the reference to 'Who Killed Harlowe Thrombey?'. The film borrows chunks of Hercule Poirot's Christmas. Marta, who resembles Pilar in many ways, takes that character's ethic, albeit ""dumbed down "" in the modern style. While Pilar and that family grew during the course of the story, these folks just become more unlikable as time passes.Not to defend the a-hole family, but the will at the center of this mess would be shot down in probate. A person, believing she has accidentally poisoned her employer and benefactor, spends the entire film covering it up, and the victim cuts his own throat to help her. That is either undue influence or evidence of mental incapacity, depending on how much of her story is believed. Fear not, Marta was the personal nurse of an doting multi-millionaire, long enough to be considered family. She's probably a millionaire herself by this time.I hate to have to mention it, but people need to get a grip on the politics. If anything, this was some sort of apology from the director. The target group was a rich Massachusetts family, and the writers were calling them hypocrites throughout.Anyway, maybe I'll have better luck with 1917."
1239,I have not enjoyed a movie this much in a very long time! This movie reminded me why people go to the movies and what good writing can accomplish. Truly a masterpiece and an absolute delight. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
1240,"Going into this I thought it'd essentially be an art piece more than something I could relate to but by the end of it I felt like I was a part of the story. It opens with what feels like if Wes Anderson directed Clue but quickly becomes so much more with the attention to details, character development and a plot that continues to blossom.You will be on the edge of your seat, relating to some characters and relating to the feeling of alienation by others. It truly was a ten of ten movie experience that I'm sure I'll watch again and recommend others see this while in theaters if they still can."
1241,"Wow! Everyone was terrific as their Characters but I wonder how they came up with this eclectic group?
It TOTALLY WORKED.
They were a ""grand"" wealthy family tripping on each other's eccentric ways. Each was an Over the Top version of a Mother, Father, Son, Daughter & Housekeeper. The only normal one was MARTA the Nurse.
Don Johnson! Who knew? He was great as was Chris Evans and Michael Shannon. These guys I would NOT expect to be in a Movie like this. The one that stole the movie was Daniel Craig. This is about as far away from Bond as he could get.
It's pretty clever to write a WHO DONE IT and I truly did NOT know who did it UNTIL THEY SPELLED IT OUT. Loved this movie. Now I want to watch another one that entertained me just like this one."
1242,"I liked the movie but i saw one flaw that kind of brought the movie down for me..
That drug used on Fran should have killed her in ten minutes, but Hugh was taken by the police after druging her and it took a while for Martha to get to Fran.. So how could she still be alive ?"
1243,"The movie stated well but then went downhill. I kept waiting to be surprised but nothing happen, the while thing was somehow predictable and lazy and Daniel Craig 's accent is HORRIBLE, I thought of turning the movie off several times because of it. Even the leading actress she's too soap opera, and Chris Evans is wasted."
1244,"I am really satisfied with this movie as I was so curious to see this new popular cast working together.
For about 1hour 40minutes I was shocked that why Craig's character is behaving like a ordinary person and not like a detective mind but then the bomb exploded and the really mind came out.
I am really sad that the old man died only because of a misunderstanding but whatever now Marta is the new Queen.
I am not pointing the story but I think the plot could had been more interesting if the secret of Marta was revealed in the last but whatever it was a nice one."
1245,"This Film was so great. Daniel was so good in his role and sometimes the movie was so funny! Also the movie had so much turns, it was wonderful to reflect who the murder is."
1246,"Daniel Craig does his best imitation of Foghorn Leghorn as a detective in ""Knives Out,"" from 2020. Craig plays Benoit Blanc, brought it by an anonymous client to investigate the death of author-millionaire Harlan Thrombey. It's been called a suicide, but slitting one's throat is an odd way of ending your life.Blanc finds himself dealing with the dysfunctional family; Harlan's daughter (Curtis), her husband (Johnson), Greatnana Wanetta (K Callan), and assorted other Thrombeys, plus Harlan's assistant (de Armas).When Harlan's will is read, all hell breaks loose.There's not too much more to say - you'll have to see this delightful Agatha Christie-like confection through to the twists and final end. Very enjoyable."
1247,Best movie I have recently watch on this geanere !!!
1248,I didn't know much about the film before going in bar it was a whodunit with Daniel Craig and a dodgey Southern accent. But wow! I felt glued to the screen for the entirety it nailed the classic whodunit tropes with finesse. Craig and Ana de Armas played the roles brilliantly with perfectly timed laugh out loud moments of comedy to break up the whirlwind unravelling. Fantastic to see something creative and with a bit of solid writing behind it in this world of gender flipping and reboots. Highly recommended.
1249,Such great cast and beautiful created crime because of the complexity to build a great mystery.I felt wondering and entusiasm during the movie.
1250,"It's a clever who-done-it in the style of Sleuth, Clue and Family Plot and it reminds us that Hollywood entertainment can be more than just fast food. It keeps you guessing and thoroughly entertained, but what's remarkable about it is that the underlying thought is carried out in a final emotional way saying ""doing the right thing is what keeps us sane and human."""
1251,"Knives out is an unbelievable mystery movie , a who done it leaving you questioning everyone and everything until the very end .Daniel Craig is the perfect investigator playing the role perfectly , ana de armi gives a jaw dropping performance and I think this will give her an extra boost In her career aswell as her upcoming projects . The star filled cast didn't have one person letting down and every character was thrilling.From start to finish I enjoyed every minute the direction of the movie flowed perfectly and i couldn't pick a fault and I hugely recommend you watch this movie. 10/10"
1252,"A must watch!, mind blowing murder mystery story ."
1253,Black comedy that keeps throwing the red herrings to you. Gosford Park meets Murder By Death. A must see.
1254,"This should have been a great movie.I'm not going to go through the plot, as it's covered here many times over. I'm going to highlight the glaring issues with the film instead.It's drawn out to the point that you almost don't care who did it, which is fine, because it's obvious who did it less than an hour in.Marta clearly says within 5 minutes of the dose the patient would be showing symptoms and sweating, but that doesn't happen. Harlan never shows any symptoms whatsoever, and we know Marta is there long enough for them to present. This gave away that she didn't OD him.Later on the film a person actually is given a fatal dose of the morphine around 8am (the same one that kills you in 10 minutes), but is magically alive at 10am when Marta arrives. 10 minutes =/= 2 hours. This was just incredibly lazy.If you think someone is a murderer why would you set a meeting with them in a dark abandoned building with no form of defense?Marta leaves her bag there daily, as were told. Why wouldn't Harlan just wrote a suicide note claiming he intentionally overdosed on morphine? Removes all the need for the whole mess if a sloppy cover up.Overall, this movie is fun to watch for a bit, but becomes tedious because it's so lazy and flawed."
1255,Different to most Whodunits. Hard to be original these days but this certainly is. Bravo
1256,"It was the coolest and the most interesting 2 hours in my life. Great script, acting and directing. It deserves 10/10"
1257,"I don't usually make reviews, but this one is so captivating, that I hope they are going to make it into serials on the big screen. Love all the wits, the guessing, the tailing, the characters, and Daniel Craig should play this again in the next series to come."
1258,"The perfect cast and the donut storyline.
The clues so simple yet complex.
Represention of the modern wealthy family
Her reaction at last was ""this family"" and that's what I was thinking about them the whole time!"
1259,"The best crime movie I have seen this year, the story is tangled, the actors are great."
1260,This is the 1st time I put anything in the review section. This is not really a review. What I want to say is it's pretty obvious that the rankings of these movies based on our scores are completely invalid. I would bet money that people who are fans of certain movies and did not even watch this movie are the ones giving it 1's and 2's just so it won't be ahead of their favorites. The whole list is pointless. The only reason for putting reviews is to at least get the satisfaction of giving your own personal opinion. Okay rant over. Definitely do yourself a favor and see this one!!!
1261,Highly recommended for anyone who enjoys a good mystery murder movie. 👍
1262,"This is an amazing film! A nod to classic whodunnit movies and books that makes the tropes part of its core in a way that doesn't leave the audience rolling their eyes. Daniel Craig's ""southern charmer"" accent was shocking at first but it definitely grew on me and is a direct reference to famous detectives of the past.Even though we get a glimpse of the truth of what happened barely 30 minutes in, the joy of mystery stories isn't always the final reveal but all the small events leading up to it. I think this movie will definitely stand up as a great modern example of good writing and direction as well."
1263,"This is Such a Good Movie, I Really Enjoyed That One, So, Basically The Plot is, The Man is Murdered This Morning, So I Don't Wan't to Spoil It, But This is a Good Movie."
1264,Loved the way the entire plot was handled with a pinch of dark comedy and gripping storytelling. Not to be missed!
1265,"This film has an absolutley fantastic cast in it so I needed to see this film, snd this film was an old fashioned fantastic mystery film. The premise of the film sees an old matriach commit suicide and every member of the family is a suspect from a world famous detective who is on the hunt. Ana De Armas plays the lead in this film and she did a really good job in this film, she is really likeable and you truly care about her character. She is our view into this crazy situation and she is easily the relatable character of the film. Daniel Craig plays the main detective in the film and he does a great job, he plays the detective very well and he is a very interesting character in this film. Jaime Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon & Chris Evans play members of the family and they all do great jobs in the film, they all play there characters very well and they are full of intrigue and mystery. The story has tonnes of twists and turns which really works for the is film, it does keep you thinking, however, I do believe that the reveal is a bit easy to predict which I did but that is literally the only negative I can find with this film. The script is great, a truly fantastic mix of humour and drama, I was laughing when I was meant too and I was feeling the emotion when required. The style of the film moves very quickly and you have to pay attention all the way through to maximise your enjoyment of the film. Overall this is a fantastic film and one that will keep you invested throughout."
1266,This is the first time that Rian Johnson shows the skills that we saw in Breaking Bad. Amazing.
1267,I didn't guess right***The girl from '13 reasons why' dies again
1268,Not sure why this film has critical acclaim. Pretty average and the who done it bit is revealed quite early. At times I thought there must be more to this and considering the overly long running time - surely it was building to a jaw dropping twist. Not really. The odd bits to reveal who else might have a hand in it are hardly surprising. The large cast is for the most part superfluous and add very little. Most are clearly not involved. Craig's sleuth isn't is as clever as you think he should be and plays second fiddle to the female lead. The only interesting thing was the 1972 Sleuth references with the elaborate house interior and the sailor man mannequin similar to Jolly Jack.
1269,"I guess if you've really liked the more mainstream whodunnit movies down through the years--Murder on the Nile--The Last of Sheila--Clue--Murder on the Orient Express and are not expecting them to come to the level of Hitchcock mysteries (which aren't ALWAYS wonderful themselves,) this wouldn't be too awful. It's very beautiful. But the acting is ridiculously one dimensional and boring. Shannon, Craig, Curtis, Collette and Johnson just aren't able to make these characters come alive in anything but the most superficial way. The writing is weak and Christopher Plummer has some of the weakest. Lucky for the film that he has real depth as an actor."
1270,"I went to see this movie last weekend with a friend, and I've got to say that I had fun. There were a few parts that had me laughing pretty hard. When the movie was over, I felt underwhelmed. It's obvious who the killer is from the start of the movie which makes it predictable. The cast is outstanding and I love that each and every one of them has a very distinct and unique character! Yet, overall it was just lacking. Spoilers ahead: truthfully I don't think that Chris Evans Character killed his grandfather. Yes he tried to, but in the end, it wasn't him. But that's just a theory.., a film theory. Anyways, this movies a fun time but I wouldn't recommend going out and spending money to see it. Just wait for it to come out on dvd. Plus if Chris Evans character really did kill his grandpa and I hadn't been told a sequel was in talks, I would have rated this a few stars lower."
1271,"Whodunit movies are the best for me. It reminded me of movies from Agatha Christie's books. The plot and the twist, the scenery, the humor, the suspense... I can't even...! A big must for mystery lovers."
1272,"I'm going to be transparent and tell you outright that I had gone to watch this film with tinted glasses. Tinted with the shade from last Jedi. I hated that movie so much that I was prepared to hate this one as well (imagine having that chip on your shoulder).Even after the movie, I kept looking for flaws to justify my shoulder chip. However, fair is fair, and at the end of the day, this is a good film. I didn't see much which can be perceived to be of political nature in this one at all. Its a who dun it with a lot of funny one liners set in a fancy estate. The cast was excellent, the writing was classy and funny and listen, you'll have fun while watching it.A movie that doesn't piss you off, with some suspense, good one liners, good cast, A fun time to spend at the cinema. What more do you expect from a movie?I put 9 and 10 star reviews for movies with exemplary technical achievements, pulling off a very difficult sequel or unique artistic value. While I cant claim those things for this movie, your fun is guaranteed. Go see it and forget about star wars for once."
1273,"This is one to see. With a great cast, and excellent script and screenplay, you will be thoroughly entertained.
Daniel Craig does the southern detective to a T. Toni Collette is unmatched in her portrayal as the gold digger. But wait! Don Johnson and Jamie Lee Curtis are so much fun on the screen again. Then the somewhat new comer, Ana de Armas hits one out of the park. Enjoy the walk down the path of mystery!"
1274,"This was such fun. It was great watching Daniel Craig be his cleverist (is that a word -- then I make it up) best as Benoit Blanc. From the beginning when he clicked when someone told a lie to the end when he figured out the lay of things. I also got a kick out of Don Johnson in this movie. I've never seen him in a role were he appeared to be so vulnerable and he did it well. Jamie Lee plays the same character in so many movies, so it's hard to tell whether that's the real Jamie Lee or not. Toni Collette was terrific and I loved all the angles they shot her -- she would look either evil or coquettish in the same scene from different angels. K Callan was a kick. She could stare with the best of them. That might have been the easiest and most memorable part she's played in a while -- a true scene stealer. And needless to say, Everybody loves Christopher Plummer. Finally, one cannot leave out Ana de Armas as Marta. She did quite well, indeed, as a frightened maid who has great reason to be. And she looks a lot better as a brunette.One thing I thoroughly appreciated about this film is that you entered into politics, BUT you had both sides of the argument, not just the libs side of things. And I loved that Don has the last word on that. :) Made me happy I didn't have to leave the movie because I will if a movie is so biased.Thanks for good fun. I love a good mystery."
1275,"Knives Out stars many people and is a Rian Johnson whodunnit about a renowned crime novelist who is found dead at his estate just after his 85th birthday. A detective is then mysteriously enlisted to investigate. He questions and investigates everything and everyone in the house to find out what actually happened. I like Rian Johnson and his films from Looper to The Last Jedi. Naturally I was excited. However I found myself to be nervous for what was to come. Murder on the Orient Express came out two years ago and had an all star cast, similar to this, and I was really pumped for it. After watching it I was let down and kind of bored. I didn't want a repeat of that. Thankfully it's not! Johnson proves himself, yet again, as one of the best film directors in the business today. The story had so many laughs and shocking scenes. It took a different approach than a typical mystery film since we're given some information towards the beginning which confused me at first. I didn't know where it would go after that but it still managed to continue a mysterious tone and question what would happen next. The cast is just absolutely fantastic, not a single bad performance. The most notable performances for me were Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. First off, Daniel Craig's voice took me for a loop. I'm so used to his british accent that when it was a southern accent I wasn't sure if it would annoy me, but I loved it. Honestly one of the best performances of the year. Chris Evan totally changes his nice Captain America personality to a total asshole and he does it so well. Every scene was fun with him. By far the best part of the film was Ana de Armas. She was in 2049 and I really liked her in that. I didn't think she'd be in this film for most of the runtime, but thankfully she was the star of it. The score from Nathan Johnson felt like a 70s mystery show. Great choice with that. The cinematography by Steve Yedlin capture the gorgeous setting. Some of the best production design of the year. As for flaws there's a couple characters that didn't feel necessary to the plot entirely. Jaeden Martell has maybe four lines because he does nothing and the cops that come and investigate didn't do much either. LaKeith Stanfield does some interviews, but the rest felt a little insignificant. Other than a couple week characters I had a blast watching Knives Out. I don't know if it has a strong enough potential for the oscars, but with a good screenplay and beautiful set design, I think it may have some of a chance.My Grade: A-"
1276,I really enjoyed this kind of mystery movie. Well written script. Very interesting to watch.
1277,"Wow just wow what a fun film ! Lets just appreciate the fact that a studio took a chance and made a film like this !!! This is exactly the reason why people go to the cinema to watch films, to have an experience like this. This film has everything in it and it can be viewed by anyone of any age, this film is not focused or marketed at any one demographic. Anyone can go to see this film and have a great time ! To the people who doubted Rian Johnson's ability after his last film, we all know what that was, you have definitely been shown to be wrong !Rian Johnson is and has always been a great director whether you like all of his films or not, the man is an incredibly talented director and writer. The film is shot brilliantly but I knew that going in, Johnson knows how to put a film together ! For me the more amazing part is the story and the script................top class from Johnson, such an elaborate story with some many twists and turns all the way up to the very very end of the film!The cast is sensational, just list the names off is quite amazing itself. How one film can have such talent by itself is a testament to Rian Johnson, because all of theses actors clearly read the script and signed on straight away ! I must say that everyone in the film is brilliant Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon and Toni Collette......the list goes on. However there are three performances that are just that little bit better, firstly Ana de Armas. What an interesting role for her to take, for me I think its a little out of left field but she really works well in the role.......her first proper leading role??? Such a likeable character..............you really do want to route for her. Although her character does have a ridiculous complex...... at first it seems stupid but as goes on, actually really works!! Quite central to the plot as well! Next is Daniel Craig, with just the perfect accent for the character. It must have turned heads the first day of shooting this film. He is so good, I hope that after he has finished with the Bond franchise next year we will see more of him in roles and films like this!! I think he is an underrated actor..........Lastly is Chris Evans, now this is a complete surprise. Who knew that he could play a villain so well, I suppose getting so accustom to him playing the good guy in a particular film franchise so long for, sort of stereotypes him. But towards the end of the film he comes into his own and steals the film.........a second viewing is needed for all the little hints.Faults of the film.................There are none!Overall this is a very good film 80% out of 100, Rian Johnson proving all the doubters wrong.........why there were any in the first place is beyond me!! Just such a good time watching it, cant wait to watch it again, definitely one of the highlights of the year. Cast is fantastic but there performances are built upon a brilliant script and story...........that has every genre of film wrapped up in one film."

1279,"A friend and I drove out of town to watch the Galaxy Quest documentary and saw Knives Out as well. Worth the drive! Funny, superbly acted, keeps you engaged the whole time, it hits all the high notes. I'm planning on seeing it in the theatre again. Do yourself a favour and go see this!"
1280,"I have no idea what this movie is all about at first. I blindly decided to watch it cuz the poster reminds me of Kingsman. But boy was I wrong and I'm glad I'm wrong cuz this movie truly blows my mind away. The plot twist and the story truly makes you in awe and curious. Truly, a funny and loveable character expecially Craig's role. Such excellent performance!"
1281,"Writer/director Rian Johnson has taken a classic whodunnit mystery and revamped the genre into a romp full of comedy and charisma, but remains loyal to the puzzle-solving demands of the genre. We can imagine Agatha Christie giving a thumbs up from her grave.When the patriarch of the Thrombey family, mystery writer Harlan Thrombey, is found dead from apparent suicide, the family comes together in hopes of inheriting the writer's riches, while, at the same time, an investigation into the suicide is being performed.From the very start we see the brilliance of the film as the camera speeds through different areas of the Thrombey mansion, highlighting Harlan's written works and collected antiques. We get to know the writer with these subtle depictions, and we infer that we are about to meet a snobby family. Although 'snobby' is an underlying subtext, the family we meet is full of eccentricity and quirkiness. Each member of the family provides something new for the palette. It's like sitting at the dinner table and enjoying a twelve course meal. And there's plenty of dessert with Daniel Craig playing the lead private investigator with the flamboyant southern accent, the mismatched pair of detectives, and the home nurse Marta, played by Ana de Armas.One area where the film detours from conventional storytelling is in showing us how the death happened at an early stage. We are then invited to figure out what is the relevance of everything else happening in the story. What emerges from this is a very satisfying unfolding of events that does not leave us feeling cheated. But beneath everything, we see issues that afflict most families and their particular members. There are the haughty ones that boast in the glory of seemingly raising a family to a higher social status. There are those that remain in a family simply to leech benefits. Then there are those that are not satisfied with what they've been given, and feel they are deserving of more. These issues produce a field of combatants that disrespect the blood that binds them, and the Thrombey family is a clear example of that: when they don't get what they want...the knives come out.In my opinion this is one of the year's better films with a stellar cast and a solid script. The younger audience will probably be bored (as were the rambunctious teenagers sitting in the same aisle as us), but for us older folks we'll be entertained and probably reminded of certain individuals that make up our family!Overall grade: A"
1282,"Now, I'm not a fan of the Last Jedi but that's no reason to dislike Rian Johnson as a director. I think he is best suited to doing things that aren't part of a franchise but let him unleash his creativity, as he has proven previously with Looper and now with Knives Out. This movie was beautifully shot, very well acted, the script was great and on top of that it is also genuinely funny. All the actors are great in their roles and everyone gets to have at least one moment in which they can shine as their respective character. I was very surprised that I could not see where the movie was going to go at all. It truly does a murder mystery movie completely differently and I am glad that the trailers did not reveal any major plot pointsl. Compared to a movie called the Good Liar that I saw recently, which was also a movie with plenty of twists Knives Out is at least a league above it. Whilst the Good Liar's surprises felt weak and preposterous, the twists in Knives Out are great and constantly keep you guessing. I was totally engrossed throughout and I was not bored even for a minute of its running time and fully recommend it. I really hope Rian Johnson makes more original movies instead of the rumored Star Wars trilogy as he is a very good director and needs to stick to projects that let him showcase his talents appropriately."
1283,"This movie supports economically Big Brother Spain, therefore, supports sexual assaults."
1284,"This movie was EXCELLENT ! I loved the fact that throughout the movie, you kind of get a sense that you basically know what happened. But at the end when Detective Blanc goes over all the events and how they lead up to Ransom, it makes you think 'how did I not think of this ?' , but YOU COULDN'T HAVE ! It's such a brain buster. And when you watch it over again, you realize all the points that connects with Ransom. This is definitely my Top Favorite Movies of All Time."
1285,"Tarantino's quote 'why, because we love making movies!' fits perfect here, knives out shows Rian Johnsons talent and love for movies and in this case the murder mystery genre. With an A-star cast of fenomenal actors Knives out is a masterpiece that i can recommend to almost everyone! my only complaint is that the black mail section of the film drags on a bit too long and knowing that Randsom is the killer a second viewing is definitely not as exciting. Still a very good movie."
1286,"I was really looking forward to this, and I tried really hard to like it, but it was oh, so boring."
1287,"This is an extremely well written murder mystery. The murder mystery aspect was done in a way that has never been done before. Even explaining who did it to my friends is too complex. You need to watch the movie to understand it. Besides the writing, you have an amazing cast. There are also amazing scenes and this movie is full of hilarious jokes. This is my favorite movie and I recommend this movie to everyone."
1288,"Rian Johnson's Knives Out contains all the ingredients of a modern classic. Its unique take on the 'whodunit' genre - which has been almost exclusively reserved to books for the longest time - is what separates it from the bunch, along with a tighly-written script and an insanely talented and likable ensemble cast.Ana de Armas, Chris Evans and Daniel Craig are the standouts in a film that keeps you guessing throughout, even when huge puzzle pieces are unveiled early in the story. Because of that, the audience knows something that most characters don't, and that adds to the entertainment factor of the movie. As clever twists and turns accumulate, it becomes evident that there is more to the mystery than you might think at first, and it just keeps getting better and better from there.Simply put, Knives Out is one of the most fun I've had watching a movie in quite a while. It's perfect for this time of the year, and I encourage everyone to give it a try, no matter where you stand on The Last Jedi."
1289,"I was a little worried about this film after the multitude of questionable decisions Rian Johnson made in THE LAST JEDI. When I saw the trailer for this, I thought it was going to be a goofy parody of the murder mystery genre. Instead, it proved well thought-out, complex without being confusing, and engaging from start to end. Maybe THE LAST JEDI should have been a who-dunnit? Who done killed the Jedi?"
1290,"The film has a creative story.
This film has created a very interesting detective story, which is why it is being considered"
1291,"I love this movie, and I don't understand why everyone is calling it overrated. It's a new take on the whodunnit genre. Supreme acting from Ana de Armas, Christopher Plummer and Michael Shannon. Great set design. Small details that you notice third way around. Overall a fantastic film."
1292,"I found the film plodded along for the most part slowly, yet methodically. I was worried a first, but with such a stellar cast, I was patient and was very much rewarded. Craig is spectacular in this (and I'm Not a Daniel Craig fan!). This is a must see film with plenty of twists and turns, despicable characters and sly comedy interspersed. Well done!"
1293,"You will feel stressed after this movie and you didn't learn anything from it, you just wish it'll be over soon and that you can recover from it.They bought expensive actors, but didn't give them any characters with depth. It's all so one-dimensional.I would rate the film as follows1. Characters 6
2. Acting 7
3. Plot 1
4. Cinematography 2
5. World building 2That's an overall 4.5 = 5."
1294,"I do not understand how this film makes any ""Best Of"" lists. It's a slow, lightweight imitation of the classic country house murder. The vomiting device is lazy and Daniel Craig's accent is truly bizarre. Any one of the Poirot films or TV series, even the one by Kenneth Branagh is better. I hope the planned sequel never comes to pass."
1295,"Tedious. Cute but not funny, overlong, ovecomplicated, overhyped & overpraised. After 45 minutes I wanted to turn it off. After 1 hour I wished I was the one being given morphine."
1296,"It's not awful, but it's not good. There's no mystery or intrigue. You follow the plot line of what happened while waiting for everyone else to find out. It's really just an okay movie."
1297,"Let´s have a look at ""Death on the Nile"", the first one. Bette Davis, Maggie Smith, Peter Ustinov, David Niven, Angela Lansbury, Mia Farrow and many more made that 1978 movie a perfect example for classic style, witty dialogue and suspense in the gold old Agatha Christie way. ""Knives Out"" ist destined to go on that trip but 40 years later they simply don´t know how to do it. It starts with the cast of which only Toni Collette convinced me. As always she knows how to create a character without overdoing it. If you need a lesson in bad acting, just have a look at Daniel Craig as the private eye. I am German but I take the guess that his southern accent is completely wrong. And so is his acting. What is his character about? I don´t care, the same goes for the rest of the cast which I don´t blame on the actors per se, it´s the script that´s lousy and the dialogue could win with more one-liners and sophistication. But it doesn´t have all that. And the story? Very transparent from the beginning and the whodunit aspect is wasted on a rather uptight attempt to make sure the story is twisted. It isn´t really, but that´s for everybody to find out. I wasted my time with this and don´t know where the 7.9 comes from."
1298,"I'm not much into Crime movies but this one, I love this one
At the beginning It was a little boring to me actually but as the movie progressed it actually became really interesting. And the ending was actually oddly satisfying.
Will recommend to others 100%
Love the plot.
Love the presentation.
One hell of a movie"
1299,"Really great so I enjoyed this a lot. Clever, interesting and plausible in its logic. I enjoyed the deception put forth by the characters. I can usually tell where something is going and was genuinely surprised by the hole in the hole of the donut."
1300,Daniel Craig is as good as you want him to be in this ensemble gig. His Savannah accent is virtually flawless throughout .A really enjoyable pastiche of the Hercule Poirot encapsulated TransSiberian Train whodunnit! The ensemble crew really good if not overwhelming ly subtle...
1301,"It's a interesting movie that's funny and with a bit of humanity and mystery all roped into one!Love the outfit with good casting! Some of the parts are a little disconnected or just too obvious but nothing bad. Without giving out much, you should just watch it yourself! It's worth the time for sure!"
1302,Enjoyable but took a little too long to reach its conclusion. The reveals became less enthralling as the movie reached its climax.
1303,"A great movie, with a dynamic multi-faceted cast. Daniel Craig was perfectly cast. A good choice for date night or lazy weekend. I intend to watch it again!"
1304,"I rarely watch a movie and right after want to watch if again, but this one really gave me that feeling. Some of the plot twists werent the most original but It really makes up for it in everything else"
1305,"If you like me like the movie ''Murder By Death'', you will love this contemporary whodunit movie.
The film has everything a good movie needs. Intelligent storytelling with some twists and turns, lovely characters and a wonderful score.
Paying much attention to details, creates an consistent atmosphere so the movie never get's boring.
Definitely a film you want to watch more then just once."
1306,"I was so excited for knives out and i really wanted to enjoy it, but i was just so let down :(
the characters were okay?? nothing stood out. the vomiting thing was weird and unrealistic (i especially hated it because i generally just hate vomit in films and tv unless it's realistic to the situation, vomit isn't funny???? it's gross)the murder was SUPER BORING. sure, it's kind of plausible, but so is any murder mystery if you do it well enough. the reveal? i found it anticlimactic and the plot was uninteresting for me.however, it wasn't atrocious- still a 6 star!- and there were some things in it i really liked:
the acting was pretty good. daniel craig wasn't too pretentious (though he was still pretty pretentious 'cos he's a genius detective so he has to be)the pacing was great, the story flowed. sometimes i forgot the plot was boringthe cuts of different times were nicely done and made it more interestingoverall, a well made movie with a bad script. easy to watch, but definitely not life-changing."
1307,"Great story and awesome casting choiceI fell in love with the choice of places, houses, even clothes of each actor.. every detail just fits perfectlyAnd i loved how they made it a comedy-mystery and still succeeded in delivering a great plot twist all through the movie til the very end..."
1308,A 2 hour long movie that could have been summed up in an hour. Snoozefest.
1309,"Overall, this was a good murder/mystery. It had everything you need to be entertained. Decent characters, well thought out plot, good cinematography, clever dialog, etc. However, as with most movies in the last few years...the powers that be always have to inject some political statement and ruin the feel of the movie. In this case, they'll claim the political correctness went both ways...but it doesn't. Alway, the PC Hollywood crowd gets their propaganda out. Tends to ruin it for those that are not Hollywood PC fanatics. Therefore, this 8 star movie gets only 5 stars."
1310,"I can't figure out why people supposedly like this movie. I gave it a totally fair chance, but it was empty and non-interesting. I legitimately didn't find it intriguing on any level. I thought maybe Johnson sucked at sci-fi and following up on other people's work but was good at other types of movies. But it turns out he doesn't have any talent in other genres either.After watching this the only thing I can think is the people who give this high marks must want to support Johnson or The Last Jedi despite this being a mediocre movie with no re-watch value."
1311,The acting is so bad that I gave up after 30 minutes. Daniel Craig's American southern accent is pathetic. They should've either left him British or casted a different actor. All other actors seem to struggle acting as well. Don Johnson should retire. The only solid actress is Jamie Lee Curtis but even she struggles with her role. What a waste...
1312,"Grear cast, but a I fell asleep.les than 10.minutes in BOTH times I tried to watch it."
1313,I've heard a lot of good things before I watched this movie and I was completely blown away at how well Director Rian Johnson put this together. The plot was wonderfully done and the story beautifully written. 8/10
1314,"Terrific, you will get a chance to see such kind of movie once in a while. Thank you for makers and actors for such a mind blowing entertainment"
1315,"I knew who it was at he first moment I saw that character.
The setup, the humor, everything is quite unique. I did not like Daniel Craig's accent though. I found it so artificial and annoying. They could've made it less obvious. The climax was good. So you will feel good about the movie. But as I am typing this, I like it less. Worth watching though."
1316,"I looked a at couple of reviews and in one, a 10 star they mentioned trolls, trolls, trolls and I thought why do people rip a good movie. My conclusion, to be dicks and to trash something other people like gives them some sort of power they lack in real life. Now though I'm completely on board with these so called trolls at least in this instance. I had two or three mild chuckles that's it, it could be that I expected to much but even if I did I would expected at least one or to real laughs but no, no not even one. The political message was clear and totally acceptable. Evil white rich people, poor undocumented nurse, granted maybe the worst on screen depiction of a nurse since nurse Ratchet in Cuckoos Nest. The nurse is also a plot hole and I'm fairly certain that they changed the nurse character to an undocumented Brazilian to give it some kind of political message. Before you get upset that I'm trying to trivialize the open borders issue the reason I believe that is simple what money grubbing entitled mildly racist family would put a nurse who clearly has no credentials verifying that she even is a nurse in charge of keeping the billionaire patriarch of the unemployed family of leeches. While it is true that the family seems not to know this but that to shows this was not something that was always part of the nurse character. And if your thinking she was such a sweet girl no ones would know this. Simone this wealthy has a bubble of protection and while his family is filled with bad people the lawyer was clearly not corrupt and looked out for the best interest of his client. One last thing on that if she was an undocumented guest of the US she would do whatever she could not to let anyone know she was undocumented so for her to take a job at a place that I'm sure would do background checks on a maid, gardener, chauffeur they would most certainly do a check on a person giving injections of narcotics to someone. I have no problem with this political message but to shoehorn it sloppily in to this movie was ridiculous. And this was not a movie made from a book as evidenced by the Oscar for best original screenplay. While it was not as funny as I expected I like something's about it well one thing I believe this could be some kind of franchise around Daniel Craigs detective character. I absolutely hate when characters have accents for no reason and his was no exception but it didn't overshadow his character and he didn't use Cajun idioms like "" that dog don't hunt "" he was a detective that happened to have an accent not a guy with an accent who happened to be a detective. It might be a stretch to make it a franchise but Mr. Craig is a draw and as far as I'm concerned he was the best character and gave the best performance in this movie. Michael Shannon Toni Collette we're wasted but it a huge cast so that happens. I have to say this, oh my god did Jamie Lee Curtis you have to like a female movie star that hasn't had so many surgeries that she looks like a snare drum and with how in Hollywood you have women playing grandmothers when they reach their late 20's it's pretty brave I only wish I was that secure with my appearance right now."
1317,Pretty decent movie compared to most movies today. I just think it's funny how much Daniel Craig struggles with changing his accent for the movie.
1318,"Fascinating characters make this a fun movie to watch, not to mention an intriguing and surprising plot. It takes a well worn storyline and turns it on its head by keeping the viewer off balance more than once as to what is really going on. Terrific acting is a plus. And it doesn't hurt that there are a few moments of levity to lighten the mood too. Thumbs up for this one."
1319,"The thing I liked the most from this movie is the attention to details. Each
character's relationship with the poor Harlan is meticulously described. This
allows you to evaluate which Trombey member could be the murderer and why.
On the other hand, since all characters are treated in the same way, you
can easily deduce that none of them could be the killer after the first part
of the film. The only exceptions are given by Marta and Ransom.Marta is revealed to be the murderer halfway through. But wait.. In the
first half of the movie we are superficially led to believe that she is; so
I think that the choice of this ""fake reveal"" is not so smart because if you tell
me who is the murderer after half movie, OF COURSE that is not the killer.
Despite this choice that I did not appreciate, I enjoyed the final moment
where the truth comes out, it was well written and filmed to me. Also the picture and the production were pretty good.To sum up, I think that this is a funny mystery movie and I don't understand
the reviewers who think that it is boring. It works good because it is
enough intriguing and amusing at the same time."
1320,Movie was done with meaning as it was overrated in the trailers...
1321,"Knives out is a whodunnit movie and will definitely be enjoyed by people who enjoy mystery movies. There were no plot holes and the flow made the movie very enjoyable, which is great considering it's duration. Daniel Craig's southern drawl definitely caught me off guard and made me giggle several times throughout the viewing haha. Overall, it was an enjoyable, fun movie to watch that keeps you entertained and intrigued throughout. I did have higher expectations going into the film, and I have to say that the movie itself wasn't outstanding in any way. But if you lower your expectations and relax, you'll definitely be kept amused by the film."
1322,"I'll admit it, when I first saw the trailer for Knives Out, I was a bit sceptical. I did not know what to think. Growing up I used to love Agatha Christie murder mystery novels, but after 2017's star-studded Murder on the Orient Express turned out to be just mediochre, I was not as excited for this film as I should've been. Knives Out has something for everyone in the family, a huge ensemble cast, a riveting storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat, and beautiful direction. As a long-lasting star wars fan, I was left disappointed after Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi, but boy did his direction abilities ever shine in this movie. Every actor, every scene shines in its own way and you follow the clues to solving the murder of Harlan Thrombey.A week after Harlan Thrombey's (Christopher Plummer) sudden demise, Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), his nurse, is called back to the Thrombey residence by Harlan's immediate family for some questioning from the police. The police question every single one of Harlan's relatives: his daughter Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), her son Walt (Michael Shannon), his daughter-in-law Joni (Toni Collette), Linda's Husband Richard (Don Johnson), Joni's Daughter Meg (Katherine Langford), and Walt's son Jacob (Jaeden Martell). Ransom (Chris Evans), Linda and Richard's son, couldn't make it to questioning nor the funeral. Sitting in the back corner of the interviewing room is Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), and he soon realizes that through their interviews, each one of them has lied only once.Blanc interrogates Richard, for some people claimed he had heard him yelling at Harlan at his birthday party the night before he died. Richard then states that Harlan was harrasing him as he had found a picture of Richard cheating on Linda. Harlan writes a letter to Linda and claims he will give it to her the next day. While interviewing Joni, Blanc realizes that Joni had been stealing money from Harlan, which he meant for Meg's school tuition. While interviewing Marta, he finds out that Marta has a reguritative reaction to whenever she lies. Blanc analyzes the thrombey's night and what could have possibly led to Harlan's demise: Ransom and Meg left the party early, and Linda hears someone coming down the stairs 3 seperate times: the first was Joni, who was checking on Marta and Harlan after she heard a loud thud, the second was Marta, leaving for the night to go home, and the third was Harlan coming down for a midnight snack. Meg comes home later that night and attempts to fall asleep, but is awoken by Harlan's dogs barking.That night, at Harlan's memorial, Marta talks to Fran, Harlan's maid, and calms her nerves by smoking with Fran and Meg. Outside, Blanc finds Marta and asks her to be his second in command, which she accepts. Marta then recalls the real story of what had happened that night: she and Harlan headed upstairs to go to bed, but Harlan insists they play games in the attic. In the attic, they play games, where Harlan knocks over the board, which he tells Joni what the loud thud was. Marta then proceeds to give Harlan his daily medicines, but realizes she gave the wrong doses to him. After she couldn't find the antidote, Harlan states that she must leave and come back an hour later, using the side ladder to head back upstairs, put on Harlan's clothes, and disguise herself as Harlan getting a midnight snack. Harlan lies down on his loveseat and slits his throat with a knife. All goes to plan except for when Marta comes back downstairs, where Harlans mother mistakes Marta for Ransom.The day after the memorial, Blanc and Marta examine the security footage to see if anyone came in that night. With slight of hand, Marta switches the tapes and hides the real one in a plastic fridge magnet. As they approach the side gate to the house, Marta sees her footprints and walks over them to hide the fact that it was her. As the family prepares for the will reading, Ransom arrives in an oddly happy mood. He then pinpoints Jacob for being very quiet during this investigation, to which Jacob responds stating that he heard Harlan fighting with Ransom at his birthday party, and blantly hearing something about the will. At the will reading, it is announced that Harlan left all his assets to Marta and left nothing to his family. Marta is bombarded by the Thrombeys before escaping with Ransom.At a restaurant, Marta tells Ransom the full story of what happened that night. Meg calls Marta and asks for part of the inheritance, to which Marta accepts. The next morning, Marta is awoken by her family who say that lawyers and paparazzi have been at their door all day. Marta attempts to sneak out of the back, but encounters Walt, who threatens to deport Marta's family for her mother is an illegal immigrant. Marta escapes and finds a semi-scanned toxology report of Harlan with the words ""I know what you did"" handwritten on it. Marta and Ransom head to the police station to get the full Toxology report, but upon arriving, find the building up in flames. After Blanc notices Marta and Ransom together, he chases them into town, where the cops take Ransom hostage, while Blanc stays with Marta. Marta checks her email and finds an address and a time stamp. She heads to the address, which is a closed laundromat, and finds Fran's nearly-deceased body. Frans final words to marta are ""you did this"", but Marta calls 911 and attempts to save Fran's life.Upon arriving back at the thrombey residence, Marta tells Blanc the full story, but he responds saying ""Ransom already told the police"". Marta finds the toxology report, hidden in Fran's secret stash drawer and lets Blanc read it while she attempts to tell the thrombey's about her actions. Before she can, Blanc summonds Ransom and Marta to the den. Blanc solves the puzzle: Ransom was aggrivated when Harlan told him that every asset of his would go to Marta and he storms out. He then turns around, climbs up the side ladder and switches Harlan's medication and steals the antidote. Ransom attempts to go back to the house in the middle of the night, but the dogs bark and he runs away. Marta, being a good nurse, realizes the slight change in viscosity of the two drugs and gives him the correct dosage, ruling Harlan's death a suicide. During Harlan's funeral, Ransom comes back to the house to steal Marta's bag, but runs into Fran on his way out. Fran threatens to out Ransom, but he finds a way to gas her and lock her in the laundromat. He then proceeds to burn all evidence that Marta is innocent by burning the police station. However, much to his surprise, Fran had 2 copies of the toxology report: one hidden at the residence and one in her purse. As Ransom attempts to kill Marta, he unawarely uses a stage knife and is arrested on the spot. Later, as Ransom is driven away, Marta stands on Harlan's balcony, looking over the Thrombeys who are all distraught from the truth of Harlan's death.Knives Out is riveting at its core. One thing that is so cool about this movie is that it straight up tells you what happened merely halfway through its runtime. The second half is the chaos that ensues after, from Ransom burning the evidence to the Thrombey's attempting to blackmail marta, to a whole different death. The problem with Knives Out is that its tone sometimes finds itself to be a bit repetitive after the big reveal. Each star shines in their own way in this film, but the shinning star in this movie is Ana De Armas as Marta. She played her so realistically since you could potentially make that character really hateable. In the end, Knives Out is a film that I could watch several times and noticed different clues or foreshadowing every single time now that I know the killer's true identity.Overall, Knives Out gets a 8/10."
1323,"I really enjoyed this film, witty, great cast and very entertaining. Johnson has regained some respect here."
1324,"The movie does keep you guessing but has needless politics. It eats up time and does nothing for the plot. The characters are kind of interesting, greed as the main motivation for almost every single one and gets tiresome. If you want to play detective give this a chance. I will never watch this again, but don't regret renting it."
1325,"This is quite a creative film and I can understand why people like it . But to me it was just kind of dull , all in all . The first half I found was good but then the second half was just too far fetched and it lost its momentum completely , making that section of the film as well as the everything else feel pointless . Again creative film but just sort of miss to me"
1326,"I love murder mysteries I think they're fantastic and there's so much you can do with a murder mystery but this film sort of lacked the whole mystery part of the film.The cast is brilliant, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Daniel Craig and so many more. Daniel Craig's character is brilliant apart from his ridiculous accent, his portrayal of Blanc is brilliant he's a brilliant detective so can solve any crime and being a film set in the modern era, they could have made this film really extravagant but it seemed to miss out.I won't explain the whole film but the gist is the granddad cut his own throat because he thought his nurse over dosed him on morphine. With most murder mysteries you don't find out who killed the victim
Till the end which keeps up the excitement but you found out he killed himself within about 45 minutes and it was pretty lame how it happened.Turns out that the black sheep of the family Chris Evans' character Ransome actually was behind the whole thing, this was very predictable because throughout the film he was shown as the bad guy so it wasn't a shock when you find out that he is behind it all. I must admit it is pretty clever how Blanc figured it all out and the Sherlock Holmes side of the film comes out and it was pretty good to watch.If you want to watch a film that will knock your socks off this isn't for you but if you want a cosy night in film then it's ideal."
1327,"1. take it easy with the plot twists. my head is turning
2. how do you know? it is explained HOW in the end but it needs a bit of realist touch there
3. the film is watchable, some sad fools voted 1/10?"
1328,A revival of the whodunit genre with a major Agatha Christie vibe.
1329,"The name ""blade out of scabbard"" makes me mistakenly think that it's a domestic killer film, so I'm not interested in the name of it. Then I was curious to see the recommendation of multiple friends.
It was not until the end that I thought the name was well translated and ""pasted"".
There are no special effects in this movie, and there is no big bang scene, which is a common thing that makes people feel like ""changing ticket price"". Even the parts of reasoning are not so hard to guess, just ""delicate"". This kind of arrangement is a little arrogant. The subtext is ""no need""
It really doesn't need those, because it's easy to bring people in, with a strong sense of presence throughout the whole process, almost delusional that it's like sitting in a stage scene - not even under the stage.
Although most of the plot is very small, it is not boring at all. Only with the camera and story rhythm firmly stuck in the eyes.
Moreover, the amount of ""nonsense"" in the lines is very small. Although it's a suspense film, it doesn't burn the brain. We don't need the audience to concentrate on what they may have missed, so we can use our brains to watch the movie.
It's as if there's a well-trained magician behind the whole screen. He opened the card early and didn't cheat you. But you can see more than you can see.
In addition to the layout itself, it is also ingenious to shape the characters.
At first glance, it's a very old-fashioned setting and layout, and even everyone's personality is as standard as a sample. However, such a rigid setting itself is also a kind of burying block, just like the essential element of satirical mime.
Therefore, it will still make people smile: such a human nature exhibition hall like unfolding, are all reasonable and unexpected. In the voice over, I heard the magician's giggle at all kinds of things in the world, so you laughed clearly.
And the most interesting thing is, a theme that enlarges the ugly reality, a puzzle sugar pot with distorted meaning.
But there is one that is relatively simple. The story ending of the youngest child.
It gives people a pleasant experience of watching movies.
Happy hunting."
1330,"I don't understand the negative reviews for this movie. The dialog was brilliant. The cast was extraordinary. The setting was perfect and the plot was tight. I have no idea how people can claim to have been bored with this movie. Maybe some of the reviews are driven by politics, not esthetics."
1331,Found my attention wonder from time to time. Maybe I just don't like these sillier mystery movies. Thought the main characters accent too over the top and distracting from the plot. The attempts of humour throughout I think actually took away from the movie. It landed somewhere between a comedy and a crime mystery. Not funny enough to be a comedy and not serious or realistic enough to be a great mystery. Great cast though.
1332,"I enjoyed this movie. I like the stars and, amazingly, each one of this character-heavy cast was allowed his/her moment to shine without confusing the basic premise. The ending was satisfying (the bad guy?/gal?) was caught and justice was served. The fun was getting to that point. Daniel Craig was a bemused ringmaster in this circus of quirky characters and holds the whole together with a deft hand.I have given the movie only a 7 rating because there were, in my opinion, two significant plot inconsistencies which I won't go in to so as not to betray any spoilers. Since the movie was played as a mixture of Agatha Christie and Clue, and therefore not to be taken too seriously, I was willing to overlook these minor issues and just enjoy it."
1333,"Solid movie, family relations revealing themselves while a murder mystery is unfolding. Although the exact guitly party is not toaly evident the way movie unfolded is pretty clear but worth watching if you can live with Daniel Craig speaking in a southern American accent, I can't for the life of me understand why he wasn't a british guy since his background doesen't have anything to do with the plot."
1334,"I thought the film was well made and the acting was good. However given that they expose the cause of the chase quite early in the film it leads you to believe that an obvious twist was coming in the end.
Its a good movie thats all for me."
1335,"COVID-19 movie night with Iris.Think the murder mystery genre is antiquated, well this provides the thrill of something new. Rian Johnson has fetched the murder mystery out of the loft, blown off the dust and given us an ingeniously constructed film. Funny and filled with so many twists it will make your head spin.And it's refreshing to see a murder mystery actually set in the present day, considering the history of the genre. I love the family argument about Trumpian politics.Daniel Craig is clearly having a blast, and is a reminder that he's capable of much more than looking suave in a 007 suit. The ensemble dazzles, but they all bounce off each other with ease. The characters are stereotypes when there's the opportunity for a good laugh, but deeper and more complicated when you get into the meat of the story.Great fun and perfect for our lockdown times."
1336,"I really liked this film! I was constantly entertained by all the recognizable actors and actresses that I absolutely adore. Very fast-paced, in other words I was never bored. A great 'who done it?' Film if i've ever seen one. Amazing performance by Daniel Craig. He blew me away. This film also has some funny scenes and an oustanding soundtrack. The unique soundtrack really adds a lot to the vibe of the film. A nice plot twist and amazing characters. This film is worth your watch."
1337,"Going into 'Knives Out'; I was sceptical about a murder mystery including all these big names and from first glance, looked like it was just, going to be okay. In spite of my assumption - when the film finished; I was instantly on the phone to my girlfriend and couldn't stop saying ""you have to watch this film!"". She then replied by saying ""that's nice honey (yawns)"" and then put the phone down. We thankfully watched it together and Gala - my wonderful girlfriend, really enjoyed it.We both loved the fact that it was a whodunit - bringing all the best elements of the genre and more. The way the narrative jumped around the basic foundation of a 'Agatha Christie type story' - had us second guessing every milestone and it was brilliant. I never knew what was round the corner of each clue - even if I thought I did. Everything was so clear but equally surprised me when something huge was revealed. It was both fun and tense - making Gala and I gasp at how amazingly well told the story was.As well as its great story and inventive screenplay, written by Johnson, we loved all the themes - particularly its stance on class and immigration. These two motifs had a very big, but unexpected impact, making it slightly political without trying too hard to be an obvious statement - giving us something quite unique and subtle. These political arguments are woven in through the dialogue and characters in a way that really brings out each persona to everyone present, in this twisting tale.All the performances are great - especially Daniel Craig's (Casino Royale) Benoit Blanc - with his unexpected Southern accent and humorous metaphors about donuts - putting a smile on our faces every time he walked onto set. Its hard to talk about all great performances and likably ironic characters, as they all have a part to play in this mystery solving adventure. However, Ana de Armas (Blade Runner 2049) gave a great performance as well as seeing Chris Evans (Avengers: Endgame) back to his old school - 'jock persona'. You can see he has really come a long way, since his debut as Captain America in 'Marvel's' 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.Even though this film has a big cast - I wasn't even conscious of the fact that they were all A'list actors. After the first ten minutes, I could honestly believe that they were all very real people such as; Michael Shannon (The Shape of Water) playing the creepy son of Christopher Plummer (All the Money in the World) - also, Jamie Lee Curtis (Halloween) and Toni Collette (Hereditary); all played very different roles from previous appearances. Each and every one of their conversations were so engaging that you could really see what brilliant actors they all are. Each character ends up being able to show their true colours at some point in the film. When all of the craziness come to an end - theres a great message, relating back to the political undertone which was just as unanticipated as the whodunit reveal.What also gave 'Knives Out' its particular feel was the amazing production and set design by David Crank (The Master) and David Schlesinger (John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum), for their wonderfully intricate attention to detail - amazing collection on weird and quirky antiques which really brought the house to life. It was like breathing through the mind of a old and eccentric explorer. As well, Jenny Eagan's (Beasts of No Nation) beautiful costume design just had me dazzled in all its aesthetically pleasing bright colours that brought a thirties vibe with a modern twist giving a balance between a contemporary thriller and a generic mystery.'Knives Out' is a film I recommend very highly and is one of my favourite features of last year - if you are into a new spin on Christies' beloved classics and maybe need a break from Jessica Fletcher; this is the one for you. Exceptionally brilliant and daring!"
1338,"If we look at this movie with a murderous purpose, it is not very difficult. However, finding the murder is not the main purpose of this movie, it is to restore the facts. It took two hours to determine that there was no very large space for so many characters to play more completely, which naturally cut off the difficulty for the audience to find the murder. But fortunately, the overall storytelling rhythm is very stable, and it can handle well in the face of so many characters. Moreover, the connection of many details and the final conversion and transmission can be said to be a very complete reasoning movie. No matter what the truth is, whether it is good or evil, as long as the knives out, what is pierced is human nature. Generally speaking, it is a breakthrough movie. Besides, I think that other characters can be more plump. With so many characters, most of them are marginal characters, which is a bit regretful."
1339,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's Clue-esque style makes for a really fun murder mystery. I wish there was more time for every cast member though, a lot of people I enjoyed lacked much impact on the story, and I really didn't enjoy Daniel Craig much, I don't know why it just didn't jive with me. Still, it surprised me. Give it a go!"
1340,"To put it simple, if you like murder mysteries, you'll like this movie. It's fun, it's clever, and it's got some good twists in it, unlike The Last Jedi (2017). Rian Johnson, who also directed Brick (2005), a film I liked, has proven himself to be a good writer/director, who just happens to not like, care about, or understand Star Wars. But that's OK, because this movie makes up for it.At first I wasn't sure about Daniel Craig being cast as a classy dramatized private eye with a southern accent, but he did just fine - though I still think I would've liked the character better with a different actor, simply because I just can't see
Daniel Craig as anyone but a cold, emotionless British guy (a role he plays so well). Everyone else does a great job however. My only complaint would be that some of these characters were underutilized.I went into this movie expecting a kind of canned dinner party mystery set in an old mansion during a rain storm, à la Clue (1985), a personal favourite of mine. This did not turn out to be the case. But still, I was surprised at the film and enjoyed every minute, finding myself somewhat disappointed that it was ending so soon.So why only an 8? Probably because I think the film is somewhat lacking in style. There are some elements that push the movie into a comedic dramatized universe (which I liked). Examples include the silly accent done by Daniel Craig, or the strong and ridiculous personalities of some of the family members. These things are one of the reasons I really loved this movie. But it doesn't feel like it goes far enough. There isn't enough screen time for most of these characters to make this film as fun as it could have been. If the screen time of these characters must be so limited, then perhaps even stronger personalities would have filled in these gaps (if that makes any sense). Either way, the movie simply felt too tame, and too realistic. It needed to go all the way.I had the same problem with Brick interestingly enough. That movie takes place in a high school but the students are so unrealistic it's as if they'd been pulled straight from a clichéd 1940's noir film. I always thought that in order to top off the farce that Johnson was clearly going for, why not simply cast adult actors as the kids, and never address how ridiculous it in the movie. I would have loved to have seen someone like Jon Hamm play a 16 year old kid, and play him just as Joseph Gordon Levitt did in that movie.Regardless, Knives Out was well written, not very predictable in my opinion, but still allows the viewer to solve the mystery themselves if they pay close enough attention. It was well made and well acted. Perhaps it deserves more than an 8, but that's what I'm giving it for now."
1341,Everything is good just it have been better if was 20 minutes shorter than this .
1342,"#Knivesout
Rating: 7.8/10
Review :
The plot is very good and there are plenty of twists and turns that keep the movie suspenseful.
There is a stage where the story becomes more interesting. The unexpected twists and trails start to mess up with the viewer too
Well worth the watch!"
1343,"At first place this movie is great, because it shows some greedy family and some innocent girl involved in this drama, which at first place hasn't anything to do with the suicide of big daddy.The actors are all great, and it's very good entertainment but....: For everyone who wants to solve the case for his own this movie is way too obvious and gives you all the hints right into your face. It would be way better if we didn't get to see so many perspectives and if you reduce the comedy elements, because a lot of them are not funny. Furthermore you don't get to know the characters very deep and there is no big mystery to solve. As watched 5 min of the movie I hoped that the whole family is involved somehow or at least many persons. This is a movie for people who aren't interested in real crime stories where you have to think. This is a movie for distracted people who need every information instantly to not get lost.At last point I have to say that the moral of poor innocent Migration girl gets the whole heir is also very poorly written. I mean, what did the family do to him that he was so upset. This thought of saying people have to learn to stand on their own feets lacks in so many senses. he could have said his whole life to them: you should something for your own. With something like that people doesn't learn, they get frustrated because they lost every moment of reacting to this new situation. To be honest I was a bit sad for the family. Ok they were a bit greedy, also some betrayed him or her daughter, but this seems like an over the top reactive drama."
1344,Such an amazing acting by most them especially Daniel. I really loved that mixture story between crime and comedy i did not feel any boring when i saw it and very excited for ending. Iam full satisfy with ending that give the the good person and poor what she deserve it and Daniel who know what happened from the beginning. Anyway it is really great pic. And i wish all the companies of movie give us like this pic.
1345,"Loved the film. Only thing I cringed a bit to was Daniel Craigs southern accent.
Also, why hasn't anyone else mentioned the similarity to Agatha Christie's Crooked House? (which I'm in the middle of watching at the moment)"
1346,"I glanced at the cast a little and decided to go. The name ""Knives Out"" is too sharp. I didn't expect it to be a mystery movie or Agatha's ""country villa"" detective novel model. However innovative it is, it cannot escape the framework of nine types of tricks that Edogawa Rampo has concluded"
1347,"The movie had a little good humor and some good acting, but also had some issues. First of all, there was only good character development for a couple characters and the rest didn't really do much of anything, such as Jamie Lee Curtis' character. Second off, the type of humor is mostly similar to Wes Anderson movies, where you think to yourself ""hmm that was funny"", but rarely laugh, which explains why it's rated so high... people thinking they got the humor that others didn't, which isn't the case.At least it had a few funny scenes, though, and some fairly clever parts and also very good acting. I was originally falling asleep during it and thinking it deserved 6, but then got more awake and re-watched part of it and bumped it up to a 7. :)"
1348,The final reversal of the movie is also very good for surprises. I think suspense movies can be warm and very good
1349,"Knives Out is a modern ""who done it,"" starring Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc Chris Evans as Ransom Drysdale; Jamie Lee as Curtis Linda Drysdale; Michael Shannon as Richard Drysdale Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera. A dysfunctional family comes together for an 85th birthday party for well off writer; when the party turns out to be more than expected. Linda, Ransom, and Walter battle over their father's inheritance with his nurse.In my opinion, the theme and focus of this film touches on many different areas. The main focus is on the plot, the classic mystery detective, Benoit Blanc continues to unravel the ball of yarn. Marta continues to try and fulfill the wishes of her friend and employer. This part of the theme focuses on the complexity of human relationships. An 85-year-old man in his final days fending off the money grab; Marta, his only friend in his full house of family, everyone treated him kindly for his money. The truth of human nature can sometimes be cruel.I think the setting and the music and visual elements used in the film enhance the story itself. The High-key and Low-key lighting in the mansion establishes the mood for the movie early on. From the first scene, the music and large estate give you the feeling you're in the film or the board game Clue. Ironically, it is even said in the movie by one of the detectives, ""The guy practically lives in a Clue Board"". The suspenseful score and the several internal conflicts between the family; no one knows what will happen next! This is typical of films focused on the plot; however, the first twist comes early on when Harlan turns out to be aware his death is imminent. The dramatic irony is pretty heavy in this film, from the beginning to the end.The story flow of the movie was unique and exciting. The editing was an essential part of this film. The way the story is told from several different perspectives was the best part of the film, in my opinion. Seeing how each character remembered the events of the evening piece by piece (no matter how biased or untruthful) helped put Detective Blanc on the path to finding the guilty party. The theme of the film was emphasized by the music, lighting, and setting techniques used in the film. The story was told from several points of view and was impressive."
1350,"Let's get to the good stuff first: Fairly good cast, interesting twists, interesting cinematography and direction.
The not so good: Very little character development, Daniel Craig's southern accent, and another movie in which Chris Evans is, well, Chris Evans. Maybe stick to Captain America, Chris...anything beyond that seems to be simply not great.
The rest of the cast was pretty enjoyable!"
1351,"A great whodunnit with an impressing cast and lots of twists, but unfortunately ending with where it starts off by revealing that the only character who is showing any character development at all turns out being the murderer. Nevertheless, thrilling and very entertaining!"
1352,"Fun movie, but the twists and turns aren't that intriguing ultimately. It does bring the classic mystery movie back to prominence. And hopefully other directors and writers will pick up the challenge to make more of these films."
1353,"For some reason, I did not see this movie in theaters. I did however, rent it on Redbox when it came out on Blu Ray. This movie, as my title suggests, had me thouroughly entertained the entire time. It is hilarious, clever, beautifully shot, and expertly cast. The two shining roles in this film are the characters played by Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig, who have a great on-screen chemistry and Chris Evans plays well off them both. Without a doubt, one of the best movies of 2019."
1354,"My husband and I both enjoyed the movie. It has that old movie, whodunnit vibe. It reminds me a great deal of the movie Clue, which I absolutely love. The acting is great. Daniel Craig has a lot of range in his acting abilities. The story line is fun. Basically, the patriarch of the family dies under somewhat mysterious circumstances, and it becomes a mystery as to was he killed or did he kill himself. But, there is a twist that may be slightly predictable. Who cares though? The set is fantastic, the dialogue is great, and the storyline is entertaining. If you are looking for a jump scare or flat out mystery, then it's not the movie for you."
1355,"Daniel Craig's accent was not great. He sounded like Michael Scott...""There's been a murder in Savanna.."""
1356,The movie is story is gripping and it doesn't make me bore for a single second. It makes me in every moment watching this movie. I can say that it is best movie I have ever seen of detective genre. All the characters done good job especially Denial Craig and Marta. Awesome story.
1357,"This is by far one of the best mystery movies that I've seen in a long time. From start to finish, I was locked in."
1358,"Even though it's a good movie, has your attention through out. And when you finally find out what really happened. You actually or at least me, was dissatisfied with the end, wanting perhaps not the outcome you want. You wanted it to be someone else. I think that's what I feel."
1359,An Agatha Christy kind of movie taken to another level!
1360,"... I simply put loved this one, and my only regret is that I just watched it yesterday, seeing as I want to go through it again. The build-up and plot is masterfully done, the cast is spot on and I loved the characters. The house is exactly my kind of place, I could live there in that beautiful mansion for the rest of my life. There is actually nothing negative to say about this movie in my opinion, everything just falls beautifully into place in this 'who dunnit'-movie. I wasn't prepared for this one at all, i just wanted to watch a movie, found this one and thought to myself, ""what the hell, let's try it, see if it's worth my time"" and man, it sure was, I love it! It's one of the best movies I've seen in awhile, I highly recommend it!"
1361,"Knives Out is a murder mystery, much like Clue or Murder on the Orient Express. It is light, minimal violence and minimal language. No nudity. No serious blood. Not for the little ones.I'm critical of all movies except comedies. I give them a bit more slack when it comes to mistakes. However, when it comes to murder mystery movies I'm deadly serious about my nit picking.I won't bother with the problems I found in the movie, because I finally found a movie I enjoyed. A rarity in today's society of stupid, reboots and plastic filler movies, written for the people who do not care about quality.With Knives Out, I forgot I was in a movie theatre and that is rare for a movie to do to me. I became entranced by the characters and the story that I drifted from reality in to a different world. That is what movies should do for the viewer. That is why going to a movie theatre is so special and a great social experience.When we left the movie, all we could talk about was ""did you know who did it"" and ""when did you figure it out"". Some other questions were about being confused or thrown off the scent of the killer. We also asked about the various characters and scenes which we thought had some hidden clues.I had narrowed down the list to two people in the start of the movie, but by the middle of the movie I knew already who had done it.I'm shocked that this was by Rian Johnson. After the Star Wars cluster that was out I thought I would never wanted to go see any movie connected with him, but I'm glad I didn't know he wrote, directed and produced this movie. I would have missed out on a great experience.Overall the movie was not perfect. It has some serious mistakes in the plot and technical details. However, if you look past those errors the movie is extremely enjoyable. The characters are colorful, the setting in the old house with all the odd and strange items, making you realise the eccentric nature of the patriarch.I want to give it an 8 but it doesn't deserve it. Attention to details would have given it a 9 from me."
1362,"What a fun movie it was to watch. It starts like a crime movie based on a novel by Agahta Christie. And to some extend it is. Huge mansion, rich head of the family and all of those who want the heritage. Shortly after the family party, old guy is found dead. At first sight it looks like a suicide, but while digging it appears that all of the family members would have a motive to kild an old man. When it appears that a week before his death, millionar has left all his fortune to a nurse entartainment develops furthe. At some point I was fed up with watching this type of movies but this movie has broguth my love to old fashioned crime movies back. For sure worth to watch."
1363,This movie was good. I was entertained. The only problem for me was that it was easily figured out and there was no suspense or ah ha moment like I expected.
1364,"You can just tell from the second half of this film Rian Johnson is the kind of guy you would HATE anyone uncovering his mistery so he can shove us how ""clever"" he is, and in order to do so while subverting our every expectation of the whodunit genre he bended my suspension of disbelief so hard it broke into little pieces, like my initial enjoyment. The plot is so overly contrived it REEKS of tryhard.The point of a mystery is to be solved or at least attempted to be solved. It makes the viewer interact all the more with the movie. This is possible when the clues are not too much for it to be too obvious or too scarse to be impossible. Then he goes to foreshadow the guilty person but nope!, guess what, that mystery is already solved within half an hour and, wait a minute, another mystery is rising!, wait, now?, yes, and it's impossible to solve but hey, good detective that seemed useless 90% of the movie turned out to know everything from the start, well how good is that.......This is anything but a whodunit. I felt cheated. 6/10"
1365,"All star cast directed by the guy hot off of ""The Last Jedi"", what could go wrong? Well, the wife and I fell asleep during the first 20-mins, so big ding for early pacing. The next night I insisted we finish it because ""all star cast..."" and it turned out well. It was a decent enough whodunnit with a few twists/misdirections. The final scene could've been better architected, so we weren't really satisfied with its denouement."
1366,"Being one of the few admirers of the much hated ""The Last Jedi"", I was excited to watch this film. Mystery films are generally not my cup of tea, but this one was really engaging. The plot was easy to follow, even with Rian Johnson's penchant for twists. The ensemble cast was great, though Daniel Craig's Kentucky accent bothered me quite a bit. Still, I think he's a good comedic actor-despite his irrefutable image as 007. The overall pacing was solid-this is what Rian Johnson is capable of doing if given the right genre and material. A stylish, and entertaining flick for a Friday night."
1367,"Best movies 2019. Great script, great execution (sorry). Looking forward to a sequel. Go see it!"
1368,"Saw this one coming a mile away from the opening scene, great cast Daniel Craig's fake accent was shocking, overall fun very light hearted"
1369,"Knives Out is an exciting English family mystery film realesed in 2019. The film's cast include the prominent talented actor Daniel Craig who stars as detective Benoit Blanc. And John Evans as Ransom, the black sheep of a wealthy, self centered, typical American family.
The film depicts a inward bitterness and buried differences among family members but who outwardly try to impress the head of their family head Harlan Thrombey, a respectable novelist and publisher. Martha, an immigrant, is a house maid and a help to this family head, who loves her more than he loves his own blood. But to be honest, the reason for such love to me was as mystery as the film itself. On the night of his 85th birthday, Martha mistakenly gave a wrong dose of medication to him. This triggered the creative, artistic brain of the novelist. He came up with a well worked perfect plan to save his help and friend from a likely murder charge and potential jail. But nothing is too perfect in this world. Who can connect the dots and literally find the tiny hole within this well worked perfect plan? Would it be detective Benoit Blanc?
The film is set in a morden day American society where there is pride in been a succesfull enterprenuer. The inclusion of Martha's origin and eventual procedings shows how humility and hardworking pays, irrespective of who you are. A perfection of the film's storyline reveals creativity and genius in screenplay; though with most of the scenes been straight forward, with self revealing mysteries. Martha's performance was key to the success of the film, by her ability to match background or origin with character.
I strongly attest that this film would merit the extoils of fanatics for its lively entertaining mystery. And it is worth watching especially in this era of our time in which everything happening is of nothing but mystery."
1370,"Good, solid, fun movie. I was entertained all the way through. Well worth a watch."
1371,"I enjoyed it very much...
The good little mistery and the little run-around were entertaining.."
1372,I watched this mainly because I hated Star Wars Episode 8 but I heard this movie was better. The plot of this movie was much better than Episode 8 and I enjoyed it. Highlight of the movie was the performance by the main three characters.6/10 a decent enjoyable film.
1373,"I was wondering if I'd wasted my money the plot was so weird and disjointed at the beginning, but hang on - it gets better and better and comes to a great conclusion."
1374,I guess Star Wars fans are still angry with director Rian Johnson's The Last Jedi. KnivesOut is like an Agatha Christie story but with American characters in modern day America. It's a star-studded old-style whodunnit with hilarious parts in many scenes. The movie will have mixed reviews as it's strictly for people who are looking for a nostalgic entertaining time.
1375,"The movie starts with a statement, that it supposedly will keep you guessing until the end. Putting aside that this is weird and personally i did not care for such a start, it is also a lie. That is not to say that the movie had not twists. Still with a beginning like that I had higher expectations.
As far as the plot goes, the story begins with the death of a rich writer. The leading actress feeling responsible for his death, tries to hide the fact that she is involved from the investigation that takes place about the circumstances of his death. This pretty much sums up the movie.
While the movie has a nice flow, and most of the actors' performances are good enough, especially the ones with more important roles, I feel like it, it is far from perfect."
1376,"It's very cool seeing Chris Evans playing a character so different from Captain America. Thought Daniel Craig was good as always, but at first his accent came across as kinda fake and obviously influenced by his British roots. Ama de Armas was good at playing the kind hearted nurse, and my god... She's beautiful. No problem with the editing whatsoever, it was fast paced but the movie took his time at times also. Go watch this one with a friend or family! It's a good time and will make you laugh too!"
1377,Good actors I had a whole theater to myself. I would not call this a great movie and it was way overhyped for people to say so. The ending was decent and I wanted to give it a 5 but in my opinion the actors really did try to do their part. It was a bit long and did not flow through to keep my interest from wandering so I had to give it a 6 no way was this going to get a 9 or 10 from me unless someone paid me and JJ Abrams really screwed the Star Wars fans on this last one. Not comparing this to Star Wars for those that are upset and trying to compare this to Star Wars
1378,"This reminds me a lot of The Prestige. Not so much in storytelling (though there are some similarities), but in terms of how a director made a very financially successful film and followed it up with something much smaller as a way to recharge his batteries. It's clever, witty, and fun, but it's more of a way for Rian Johnson to stretch his creative legs than anything else. Still, it's a good time at the movies.A lot got made of the film's early reveal of the central death, and it does provide a certain level of uncertainty as the film moves beyond it. It feels like there's no more of the mystery to explore for a long stretch, and we're left with our main character, Marta, as she navigates the mess she suddenly finds herself in. It's gonna be hard to talk about this movie without spoilers, so I'll actually give a warning. Skip to the final paragraph to skip the spoilers.So, Marta is Harlan Thrombey's nurse. He is the patriarch of a screwed up family allowed to be screwed up because of his financial success bred from a long series of detective and mystery novels (one of which is titled around knives, hence the circle of knives that features prominently in the marketing). The night of his 85th birthday, when his whole family came to visit, Marta accidentally gives Harlan 100mg of morphine. Knowing what she's done and unable to find the drug to counteract the morphine, she explains to Harlan that he's going to die in the next ten minutes. Harlan, seeing his impending death, the guilt that will be placed on Marta, knowledge of what he's done with his will recently, and desirous of keeping his family away from their inheritance completely, decides that he's going to cut his own throat, making his death an obvious suicide.Marta helped stage the scene as well, breaking back into the house to help clean up, but she left a trail of evidence that she never noticed and only becomes aware of as she walks with private detective Benoit Blanc through the scene. She's guilty of killing Harlan, but it was an accident. It was also obvious that Harlan liked her better than he liked any of his children. We end up liking her because of her innocence and her inability to lie (leading her to vomit every time that she tries), and as a contrast to the hornet's nest that is Harlan's family.Everyone hates everyone else. There are affairs, thefts, lack of ambition, and general unpleasantness all around. Harlan had bred a group of ungrateful loafs when he had thought that he was raising men and women who would build their own legacies as he had. He wants to cut them off for their own good. However, he told his grandson Ransom too early. This is where the twists actually begin to pile up. Ransom switched the medication in Marta's bag, so Marta hadn't actually poisoned Harlan and he had just killed himself. Ransom gets tricked into admitting it in front of the police (complete with Marta lying and holding in the vomit just long enough).The movie is clever. It tries to convince you early that you know the twists and that you're just going to follow the main character through the investigation that just won't stop because of the doggedness of Benoit Blanc, but it leaves more twists to come while providing enough time between to focus on Marta and her troubles to act as a convincing red herring while also creating enough character work to make people that we can invest in. There's a whole host of activity going on including a coroner's report, the housemaid, and a security videotape. Marta's journey through the morass of the family out to get her after they discover that Harlan left her everything in the will and Blanc's tireless pursuit of the truth moves through the family, eventually settling on Ransom as an unlikely ally.Ultimately, I found it entertaining but a bit thin. There is an idea about heritage and inheritance that runs through the film, but it seems small compared to the movements back and forth with the plot. Marta's likeable while the rest of the family are different degrees of awful. It's twisty and turny, keeping you guessing, and leaves satisfyingly. It's a nice time at the movies. I just hope that Johnson doesn't become solely dedicated to more films in this nascent series. It was amusing, but he could be doing more."
1379,"Nail biting, the movies will make you want to see the end"
1380,"Love the cast , nothing extraordinary but extremely fun. 8/10 almost a 9."
1381,"Not many twists as I expected, but still got Few Good Twist n turns which will keep us Hooked. The Major Villian Twist may be a Surprise to many, but I almost got it. So no big surprise.Daniel Craig isn't at his Best but Rest are good. A superb Production value makes this film elevates more. Few comedies worked for me"
1382,"Keeps you intrigued and the twist is what makes this movie more interesting!!
Loved watching it
Amazing cast and amazing storyline!!"
1383,"For a more detailed review please keep reading.The GOOD: The cast is phenomenal! The list of ""A-list"" and ""up and coming"" actor's, and actresses are truly something special, but the way they interact with each other just makes this movie feel even more special. Usually when a group of actors with this much talent comes together they struggle for the spot light. I just feel like everyone had an good sense of who their character is.The story was also very unpredictable, and it kept me guessing from beginning to end. It started out with me pointing finger's, then I thought I knew who the killer was. Finally the end came, and lets just say I was over thinking the whole time. The writing for Benoit Blanc is genius and the way Daniel portrayed this character is genius. All of his little mannerisms, and subtle gestures are just perfect for this character.The set design deserves some praise. The chair with all the knives is incredible, but so is the rest of the house! It feels like an Agatha Christie novel from start to finish, and at the same time I don't think it's trying to hard.
The BAD: The costume design feels lazy. I feel like none of the characters are showing how wealthy they are. The only person who looks kinda outlandish and matches her character is Jame Lee Curtis. Also who in their right mind would buy an old BMW, then use that as their everyday car?Do the detectives not carry handcuffs or a gun? No spoilers, but even when they get introduced, you don't see a badge, or any credentials. The writing for the detectives are almost none existent. They serve no purpose to the story, which is a shame because they're played by two very good actors.
Overview: This was in my opinion one of the best none super hero related movies of the year! Which is funny because it has at least two superhero's in it. I look forward to more projects from Rian Johnson."
1384,"Interesting and entertaining, this is what every Hollywood film should be! Classic adaptation of the murder mystery genre, there were some superbly entertaining (and genuine) moments, like when the family hears the news at the will reading for the first time and how they each react to it. Likely, as the detective begins to find incremental evidence of the crime having been committed by someone other than the nurse of the Grandfather. As he holds on to the few clues at first, from the nurse and the grandson's relationships with her, then with further testimony of the evidence of the murder, detective's deveopment of the story, movie spirals into an unexcpeted comical-tragical piece of America, a story of an American family who disintegratse, not only banished from inheritance but disintegrating fast from a united family into hungry animals with each their motive for wanting that final sum of money.While the plot is somewhat predictable, it is the story is one of love, family, and honor. Superb casting, with Christompher Plumet, Chris Evans, to Daniel Craig, Toni Collete, and Daniel Craig, leading the show, and amazing final back-to-back renditions of the nurse and the grandson, this film isa brilliant showpiece, both tragic and comical. 9/10!"
1385,"""Knives Out"" is a film that can be categorized as a classic whodunit murder mystery, in the vein of the popular novels of the infamous Golden Age of Detective Fiction era in the 1920s and 1930s, but there are plenty of twists regarding the genre's well-known and overused tropes that give a kind of postmodern character in the production. The movie features a stellar cast with Daniel Craig as the detective protagonist and Ana De Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Christopher Plummer, Michael Shannon and others in the supporting roles. The director. Rian Johnson ( Looper, Star Wars: Episode VIII ), creates a proper cozy mystery atmosphere while at the same time playing with the audience's expectations by twisting the already known rules and primary tropes of the genre's films.The premise of the story is reminiscent of an Agatha Christie novel: An elderly patriarch, Harlan Thrombey (C. Plummer), a renowned crime fiction author, is found dead in his room by his maid. His throat is slit and the police investigators initially dismiss the case as a suicide. The night before, Harlan held a party in his mansion where the members of his wider family were invited. In the first few minutes of the movie's runtime, we watch one by one of Harlan's children being interrogated by two police officers and a mysterious private investigator, Benoit Blanc (D. Craig). Blanc suspects foul play in Harlan's death and he immediately detects the lies he is told by all the witnesses/suspects who seem to hold each one a motive for wanting their father dead. Until now, we are witnessing the classic build-up of a whodunit murder mystery story where every character becomes a suspect in the eyes of the viewer. But after the first 25-30 minutes, the truth about what happened to Harlan is revealed to the audience. Thus, the director overturns the genre's usual timeline which dictates that the truth regarding the murder is divulged only in the finale of the film, constituting its climax.Nevertheless, the story doesn't lose its excitement and intrigue as we now watch as the guilty party is trying to sabotage Blanc's investigation by various means in order to shift any possible suspicion from him/her. I don't want to write anything more about the story as it would ruin a remarkable viewing experience. The film's plot is solid and unravels in an even tempo with each shot having its own importance and place on the overall puzzle. The acting by every member of the cast is impressive and especially Jamie Lee Curtis after a long time delivers a memorable as well as hilarious performance as Harlan's daughter, Linda. Craig is doing an equally splendid job in the role of the brilliant, mercurial private eye who shares some common characteristics with some of the genre's most beloved protagonists-detectives of the classical era.The element that makes ""Knives Out"" a worth-remembering picture is its great sense of humor which is expressed mainly by the quirky characters on-screen and the truly exceptional dialogue. I can't remember a single whodunit title from the past that featured such great interaction sequences between the characters. It should be mentioned that Rian Johnson is also the screenwriter of the film and he proves that his talent extends much further than directing. This is a movie for all, as I doubt that there will be many who will dislike ""Knives Out"" . It can be recommended to families too, as there is a total absence of gory images and/or profanity."
1386,"Good acting, good story, great twist and a few laughs"
1387,"I was expecting to be blown away with some bananas twists and turns. The writing is fun but not mindblowing. I thought Daniel Craig's character could've used more of an introduction to start the film. I found his role a bit distracting until I got used to it. I also felt too locked up in the setting until finally getting a reprieve with a new scene/setting. I would've started the movie with Craig at another location.Go and see it though, it's fun."
1388,"This might be an unpopular opinion but Daniel's accent (in my opinion) made me choose a 7/10. It wasn't that the accent was bad for his character, I just felt that is wasn't needed. It was a great mystery with fantastic actors and AMAZING costumes. I do think he the film would've been better with Craig's natural accent instead of the one used in the film."
1389,Entertaining detective film which only has excessive final explanations.
1390,"After seeing Uncut Gems the previous night, my wife and I needed something a little more fun. This is a visual pleasure but a light light script.If you like a little weird, You are going to enjoy Toni Collette in this film, particularly her interaction with JL Curtis.JL Curtis would have stolen the film if she were given the same screen time as Daniel Craig - She's just got the right role for her to be endlessly enjoyable.I also really enjoyed the shady grandchild role of Hugh or ""Ransom"" that Chris Evans offers as well as the patriarch played by Chris Plummer, Amanda's Dad.Many many scenes are filled with campy light fun and enjoyable acting. But it did feel as if a producer thought the film was running long, so the writers were directed to have Daniel Craig talk out the conclusion to the mystery - like someone trying to cram in words to the end of a thank you note.From this film, my wife and I wanted just a little more for the evening. We immediately then set out to see Eastwood's Richard Jewell. As our evening closed, it was difficult to remember a single scene of Knives Out after having Eastwood's fully engaging film take hold of your short-term memory."
1391,"All around this movie is just fun! Rian Johnson totally proves his worth as a director after the polarizing star wars movie he made. The twists and turns throughout this movie made for a fun ride throughout, and my eyes were absolutely glued to the screen. I personally don't care for mystery stories, but this is a movie that actually subverts expectations in an interesting way. It also has some great acting and humor from the main characters. I'd absolutely recommend this movie!"
1392,"I've seen all the praise for this film and it wasn't a terrible film or anything but I don't get the glowing reviews and ratings on here. It was pretty boring, in my opinion.The acting was great but it just felt like it dragged. It did have a pretty good twist at the end but I found myself checking the time multiple times because I was ready for it to be over."
1393,"A guy got killed. Who's the guilty one? Hmm, pretty obvious from the get go but lets watch... Actor list at least is filled with semi-famous names. Some of them play their roles routinely well, some overact. Especially Craig's accent was ridiculous and goofballing doesn't fit his persona at all. Plummer was solid and it was nice to see Don Johnson too. Rest were okay.The film had ""humorous"" tone with it which was completely unnecessary. Comedy is hard and clearly it missed the mark in this one. Not just me, but the whole theatre audience laughed perhaps once. Barfing main protagonist immigrant lady wasn't funny at all and belonged to b-class family movie. Craig acting as a goofball detective was another miss (I like him nonetheless). Rest of the small ""comedy"" bits were all somewhat off. Just do full comedy if you intend to do so, and not half arsed like this which just gets on the way of otherwise decent movie.The plot wasn't very original, been there, seen that, but it kept the movie going. At least to me there were practically no ""twists"" in the plot. I expected more and something original. What else? One thing to mention (scriptwriter thought to be funny?) is the under-aged boy who's been called as a ""nazi"" because of his political views. Twice, with no remorse. Sounds pretty familiar at these times doesn't it? Not cool.Knives out has a stupid name but nonetheless is quite good representative of ""murder mystery"" genre movie. There was pro-feminist Star Wars, Frozen 2, and this running in theatres. I chose this and was pretty happy about it."
1394,"It was ok but they basically told us it was Ransom early on, then in in final thrid it was all pretty predicable how it was going to end."
1395,"It was a nice experience overall but nothing and I mean nothing is as painful as Daniel Craig's fake southern accent... I cringed throughout the whole movie and couldn't really enjoy or feel some parts of the movie because of it.
for me lots of the events were expected so no element of surprise for me, but I still enjoyed it."
1396,Wow I really liked this movie. I generally do favor murder mysteries but this one keeps you on the edge. It's suspenful and the acting was good. God Daniel Craig accent was undeniably good. I got hooked up as soon as he started talking. Chris Evans was outstanding and the rest of the actors were brilliant too. Ana de Armas has a great future ahead. What an actress and a cutie 😛. Go give this one a try won't be disappointed.
1397,"I watched this movie just recently .. and i was captivated. It is one of those movies that feels very condensed to one location. So the location needs to be exciting and varied enough.In terms of plot - it is the ""usual"" clue/murder mystery. In terms of storytelling, there is a lot of flashback (some right, some wrong) and the accompanying interrogation.The characters are for the very most part interesting and very well acted (although they do portray strong character stereotypes - so not too subtle) - but the chemistry and likability/or dis-likability .. is that a word? .. is quite well done.While the plot is straight forward, it quickly gets more complex - morally as well as technically .. but never so convoluted that one is not able to follow it anymore.conclusion: i can fully recommend this movie. Due to the nature of it (being a murder mystery) .. it is not suited for re-watching though."
1398,"I'm not usually fond of this type of movie, because its usually very obvious. This story telling is unique in that you know the answer immediately...sort of. But things twist and turn, and the cast is all good in the meantime. The best part is that of the probably least famous in the cast, which is the nurse. I just love the idea that she is so against lying that she vomits, which I thought might have been faked or deceiving at the start, but I'm glad it wasn't."
1399,"At times amusing, rarely suspenseful, really a paint-by-numbers whodunit hiding a lecture on decadence and immigrants.Medical practices at center of the crime(s) have little to do with reality -- same for the so-called cops. The bits about the blood drop and the recording -- just lazy.Family characters needed to be deliciously malicious but instead seem pretty grubby, seem pretty much labels for lecture examples. Their collective helplessness and incompetence may create sympathy for the hero (sort of a plaster saint that vomits) but it doesn't make for satisfying drama.What saves the film? Proper mystery sets, some fair game criticism of elitism and xenophobia, and efforts by very capable actors working with a script that wants to be ""knives out"" but is more like...well, there's a prop at one point in the film...See it? Sure. Enjoy the veteran and young actors, but this movie could have been so much more enjoyable if the characters had been written to be worthy of the title."
1400,"An incredible cast and a gripping enough storyline that made this fun to watch. Some of the twists were a little obvious and easy to predict, but overall this did not detract from what was an enjoyable experience that rolled along nicely."
1401,"Enjoyed the movie though I felt it worked a bit too hard at trying to lead viewers down a wrong path. Motives introduced rapidly, then revelations that undo all that set up. If this was a mad cap comedy that would be fine, but this was intended to draw you into the whodunit with the occasional laugh.Still not sure about the opening scene. Nurse comes in, fixes a breakfast and coffee very casually, then goes to bosses bedroom, hmmmm, not there, then casually goes upstairs to his study and finds him dead! Shock, she drops the tray, etc. Turns out she knew he was dead upstairs the entire time because she watched him die!Acting was pretty good, could have done without the political drama, I don't go to movies to watch pantomimes of CNN or Fox talking heads spout their views.The rest of it fit together causing you to have a few ""oh, yeah, that makes sense"" moments. Be nice if they have a Benoit Blanc series where the casts have just a bit more fun with their roles. Daniel was great in it."
1402,"While not anywhere near as clever as it would like to think it is, there's a lot to like about Rian Johnson's Knives Out. There's an almost comic book pantomime quality to it all, a farcical Agatha Christie filled with Cluedo styled characters who serve their limited purpose as red herrings with aching archness.There's the bitterly cynical rich old man, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who dies on a night when he is surrounded by his children, their partners, grandchildren, and caretakers, most of whom have a higher opinion of themselves and their achievements than Harlan does.It's obvious everyone's enjoying themselves, most of all Daniel Craig. Chris Evans chews up his bad boy role. Toni Collette is fabulously OTT as a sleepy eyed health guru. Jamie Lee Curtis sneers derisively at everything she disagrees with, which is mostly everything, including husband Don Johnson. Ana de Armas flitters about as the hapless caretaker. Christopher Plummer enjoys himself immensely as the man with all the money in the world who laughs last before he pops his clogs.Then there's a will.There's a dispute over whether Harlan's death is suicide or murder.And there's Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc, who deserves another run out as the Southern fried consulting investigator. Everyone involved gets their moment to shine, with the initial questioning session giving them all the chance to show how good and decent they are which may come back to haunt them as the story plays out.It does sag in the second third before gathering pace and racing towards the finale, one of those intricate Agatha Christie double-triple twists in the tail that really doesn't feel as though it's anything more than a handy way to tidy things up despite relying on far too many coincidences. There's few things more frustrating in cinema than watching a movie that tries to be so very smart and then trips up over its own laces as it approaches the finish line.There's no shock in the revelation that it was this thing all along, you just go along with it because this is where you've been led and it's just not entirely satisfying. Pity."
1403,"As I'm not much of a murder mystery fan personally I felt the first half of the movie kind of dragged on for me and I never expected to be so drawn into it as I was.As the plot thickens, so does the intrigue, as does the interest as to what the heck is really going on. By the end of the film I walked away loving it and intend to watch it a second time. Clever movie well acted with interesting plot twists galore.Recommended viewing."
1404,"I loved the production in its entirety. Great classic representation of the murder mystery genre, with theatrical characterisation and art direction.My only call-out here is the timing of the stage-gates of revelation. We know far too much too early about the nurse and see far too little about the juicy suspect motivations which remain underexplored before the main plot is revealed. There was far too little left to presume halfway through the timeline which led me to conclude the answer before the question had time to ferment.Al in all, this is a fun flick. It's less 'whodunnit' than 'whydunnit'."
1405,It had an intelligent plot and was better than I expected. I enjoyed the imperfections of both the inspector and nurse; they had the best scenes. Old Christopher Plummer did a fine job; Toni Collette as well.
1406,"I enjoyed the ride of this film, but did it linger in my mind, no. Some funny moments, some suspenseful moments but nothing really ties a bow. Every performance is good, Michael Shannon and Christopher Plummer being my personal favorites. I was a bit disappointed there wasn't more for Jamie Lee Curtis to do.Maybe I'm just not a huge fan of ""who done it's"" I do enjoy Gosford Park and Murder By Death but otherwise I find the genre a bit dull. I appreciate the effort here and all it just doesn't resonate quite the way I expect."
1407,"Was pretty average. Had high hopes and didn't get why this movie gets an 8+ on IMDb. Was mildly entertaining and had some interesting parts, some funny parts but mostly average"
1408,"This was a fun one to watch. I love the story line; it's a whodunnit with many twists and turns and a perfect splash of humor. The acting was fantastic. Ana de Armas was amazing and I feel she and Daniel Craig really steal the show here. Craig plays the vigilant sleuth trying to get to the bottom of things, (and he pulls off a southern American accent very well for someone from Britain).
Knives Out is one that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time because just when you're sure you have the whole thing figured out, they throw you a curve ball."
1409,"I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised. A good plot, with good pacing and good acting all round (especially by Ana de Armas & Daniel Craig).It's not the best movie all year, but it's certainly in the top 10 I'd say. You're constantly thinking that the person who did it, will be caught (since you, as the viewer, knows exactly who did it, yet the characters don't), and that makes for a great story, eventhough you're misled and lied to at every turn. It's just really really good writing and directing tbh... bravo all round."
1410,"Really liked this movie. Not exactly what I expected, in terms of the plot, but an easy movie to watch and get drawn into, with an almost endless amount of twists and turns to reveal the ""villain"" and plot for the movie as a whole.
Generally good acting, good story, flow and chemistry amongst the cast makes this an easy recommendation for anyone to watch."
1411,If your looking for the Mandalorian it won't happen. This movie is perfect for mystery and who done it fans.
1412,"Let the mystery begin! When you sit down you kinda know what to expect if you watched the trailer, but at the same time you have no idea what's going to happen next. Whenever a question is answered in the story, another one right away arise.The story gives you the classic ""this is my main suspect"" phenomena to pick your guilty party when you conduct your own ""investigation"" during the dialogues, but obviously you can't be sure if you're right or wrong. Cleverly giving out clues during the story progression makes you realize that you may be wrong all along.
I can't remember a period during the movie when I didn't have to pay attention. Everything the characters say and do on screen, adds up to the greater picture.Great cast and performance from all the actors involved. Excellent entertainment for 2 hours. Well written, great directing along with great music. If you want something different, I highly recommend to check this one out."
1413,"Movie was nice and I exited the theater entertained. Was it one of those mind blowing movies, no. But it was decent enough to cheer my mood. It is one of those movies that you would like to see but you wouldn't mind if you waited till it is available on TV.Overall I would say go ahead and see it, its worth watching."
1414,"After Disney Star Wars was redirected away from coherent story to hidden boxes by Abraham and Johnson, I was curious to see what Johnson would do with this film. It's the same formula. Subvert expectation... that's it.
The acting was good. There were no standout performances. The story was average (not bad, not good). The ending was mostly predictable (especially the final twist). Simply expect twists and you won't be surprised.
If you've got nothing better to do, it may be worth a watch. I found it dragged for 30 minutes too long.
Johnson needs a new schtick beyond subverting expectation. It makes his films predictable."
1415,"I wasnt sure what to expect with this movie and if I would like it as I usually enjoy serious crime or thriller themes. I was pleasantly surprised, the plot kept me guessing and every time i thought i had it all blatantly figured out a spanner would be thrown in the works. There is a little bit of silliness and comedy thrown into the script to try keep audiences entertained which was not my cup of tea but overall I enjoyed the plot. Daniel Craig also surprised me and it was good to see him in a different type of role."
1416,Really well written and acted. No plot holes and an intricate and delicate plot as well. Not over the top and very believable. Anyone that says this was a bad movie doesn't appreciate movies.
1417,"This was a very entertaining murder mystery movie. Really make you think of the game and movie Clue but much better. I was a little unsure of it going in but was pleasantly surprised.The acting was amazing, helped in large part to its outstanding cast. One glance at the cast list is enough to convince most to give this movie a shot.Its biggest downside is that once you have seen it once there really isn't much incentive to see it again as the surprise is over with. Its definitely worth watching though and I recommend it to everyone."
1418,"Basically this movie is similar to the 1985 movie ""Clue"" but with a much better cast and a bit more funnier than the other. No spoilers here and if you want to be mildly entertained than it's for you. I rated this an eight because of decent acting throughout otherwise this would have went belly up. The movie itself has some twists and turns but not enough to throw you off track. I did like the setting and the sets as well as the characters this time around. Enjoy it if you watch it but don't hope for too much."
1419,"This was a very witty and well made movie. I believe that the characters were cast it appropriately. The production value is decent and the story is good, but predictable at times."
1420,"I rarely write reviews, but the hype surrounding this movie is completely unwarranted. very well acted and well made, but extremely boring. NOT A BEST PICTURE CALIBER FILM."
1421,"I went to this movie because I love a good mystery. I thought it would be hysterically funny, but it wasn't. The characters were well defined in a brief period of time and every single actor got a juicy part in the story. Almost all of them got to show a bit of humor in their part, which is probably one reason it has comedy in the movie description. I find if I say anything about any one of those characters I MIGHT give too much away. Kudos to writer, director, actors and that wonderful house setting. This is the kind of movie you will want to watch again to see what more you might spot the second time."
1422,Whole family loved this movie. Enjoyed the ensemble cast. Well written. Don't know anything about screen plays or scores but they were pretty good too i guess.
1423,"I have been struggling to understand why this movie is rated so highly. The cast is great and they do a good job with what they are given. That being said, the whodunit part is poorly made, and I choose to believe that was intentional. Perhaps it's my fault for going in expecting a Jessica Fletcher, Hercule Poirot or Sherlock Holmes type story. I was disappointed by the clues, reveals, as well as the ending. Cannot wait for Sherlock Homes 3 to come out."
1424,"Funny that this is not a murder mystery at all yet still managed to have me on the edge of my seat wondering not WHO done it, but rather, HOW it was done. All the clues are there out in the open. I would go as far to say that they are presented that way for enjoyment. Anyone keen on viewing this film to figure out the big ""mystery"" will pay attention to everything, subtle or blatant. If you do you will be rewarded with the obvious. As obvious as it may be it is still enough make you feel good for following along as close as you did. Even if that is not your cup-o-tea its a wild ride the entire way and well worth it. Id go as far to say that the actual characters are waaaay more interesting than the plot itself."
1425,"An entertaining movie that does its good job by taking a spin on the whodunnit subgenre. Every performance given by the cast is great, The pacing's perfect, the score is well used. Overall a good movie"
1426,"Good acting
Good cinematography
Very watchable
But not great"
1427,"Do you remember 1985's Clue? If Clue was more comedy than mystery this was more mystery than comedy but still achieved the same balance needed to entertain its audience. It does start slow so if you need slapstick every five minutes to stay engaged its not for you. However, if you enjoy thinking about where it could be going and likely being fooled by the end this is definitely something you should see. The pace picks up in the latter half. The cast nailed it."
1428,"Hearing all the hype and reading all of the rave reviews, I thought for sure this movie was going to be clever and entertaining and be one of ""the best of the year."" But I gotta say, this film just falls short of my expectations. Maybe that's the problem, that I had high expectations going into it, but I'm just going to come out and say it: Rian Johnson thinks his film is more clever than it actually is.
The beginning was actually really good and definitely captured my attention - I was ready for the ride. But then after the ""reveal"" of how the murder was committed, I lost interest. If only Rian could've kept up the mystery longer and not make the mistake of trying to subvert the story for the sake of subversion (*cough* Game of Thrones *cough*), I would've given this a higher rating!
The ensemble cast was overall really good if not underused, with Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig both the stars of this movie, and the rest just playing their part. Overall, I don't get the hype. It was good for what it was but not great or fantastic as others have been lauding it as!"
1429,"On the surface Knives Out is a whodunnit murder mystery, but beneath is a subtle examination and critique of wealth acquired through family legacy in the form of the Thrombey family. While neither are necessary reinventing the wheel, both are compelling. The murder mystery is fun, unpredictable and humorous. At the center of it is Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a private detective hired anonymously under suspicious circumstances and Ana de Armas as the nurse and friend of the deceased Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). This movie isn't just interested in the mystery but in the characters that are caught up in the suspicious death of Mr. Harlan Thrombey, who by chance has just cut off the family from his money, legacy, and inheritance. The one scene that stood out in this film to me was about halfway through, where Michael Shannon's character, one of Harlan's sons, weakly attempts to extort Ana de Armas' character into giving up the inheritance gifted to her. It's a scummy move, but it's given nuance coming from someone who has just lost his father and left out of a substantial inheritance he was expected to receive for a number of years. Rian Johnson, like all good filmmakers (he also wrote the excellent script), realizes that good characters are the centerpiece of a good movie. All together this is an excellent movie, and I should mention again that it is also very funny."
1430,"Actually not as attractive as expected, lower than expectation due to the fact that they did not point out the body test and how he could leave nothing for the family. Also, the settings are quite similar to something I cannot remember whose name. It's a little surprising for the part that Evans is the one changing the pills. But all in all, not too many twists."
1431,"Absolute Stella cast but the who done it was
average with a couple of funny moments make a 7 from me mainly for the cast"
1432,"Went in with very high expectations after seeing the reviews, the cast, and the fact that I adore murder mysteries... but often forgett how this love made me feel disappointed on so many occasions.Overall, I liked the film. Great acting, excellent photography and very interesting plot and characters. I just felt that the reveal was, maybe, too fast. The ""reveal"" of how the event actually took place was too early for me, eventhough I knew there was more to the story. Which was revealed at the end, VERY quickly (for me and my friends at least) in a way that you don't have time to put the pieces together yourself, or even go back in memory to check that everything said is correct and void of loopholes. Especially that the way everything happened had SO many interrelated elements where the chronological of each event is crucial to the story. It is very easy to get lost.I think this deserves a second viewing, but I'll wait for the blu-ray.
7/10"
1433,"It's a wonderfully crafted blast of Hollywood entertainment that's wholesome, amusing, deviously intelligent, star-studded (with actors breaking their own mould), and an old fashioned whodunnit (almost), all at the same time. Recommend watching."
1434,"Sure, it's not groundbreaking and eye opening. But at the end of the day it's not meant to be. Knives Out seriously succeeds at what it's meant to be, a thoroughly original whodunnit, that is genuinely fun to watch and try and figure out, and when you think you've done that you might just be surprised. It's full of little notes and quirks that make it really fun to try and figure out, with an excellent cast of likewise quirky characters and it ends interestingly and comfortably. It's humorous and entertaining and I enjoyed it. It's directed in all the right ways to give it away, but not at first glance, making it a great mystery. I think Agatha Christie would enjoy it. It's cool to think there are still some fun twists and turns out there and to think that people can keep coming up with fun stories and entertainment makes me pleased for the future of cinema. Sure it does get a little bogged down with its political humour, which makes it awkward at times and honestly it could have done without. Nonetheless, Knives Out can take you out of reality for a few hours and on an adventure to places you mightn't have expected. 9/10 from me for a movie I enjoyed."
1435,"Although Daniel Craig's Louisiana? Mississippi? Who knows? accent could have used work, the ensemble and story really worked well. It was convoluted but airtight. And fortunately it didn't take itself too seriously. Obviously Rian Johnson loves Ana de Armas--the Cuban Jenna Coleman--because every shot maximizes her flawless face.
Aside: there is one scene in which the characters discuss politics, and as an NRA member right wing Trumpster, I thought it was perfectly fine--though completely unnecessary to the plot."
1436,"I'm a huge murder mystery fan, and I originally wasn't going to see this movie DUE TO the rating that was on  long before the movie came out to the general public. I'm so glad I didn't listen.Rian Johnson's Knives Out is a perfectly entertaining thriller/mystery movie, with an all-star cast, a compelling and intriguing plot, and a very poor accent from Daniel Craig. That being said, the minor plot holes and slip-ups this movie inevitably has are no excuse to give it a low rating, as its job is accomplished with fluency and elegance. I was interested the whole way through, and even if the ending wasn't the biggest plot twist in the world, I found the first and second act to be even bigger plot twists which more than made up for it.All in all, the movie delivers on an entertaining, not-so-family-friendly mystery that should leave you walking out satisfied. I'm happy to see the movie's true ratings are coming out as we speak and they are getting higher and higher. This is worth your time and money."
1437,"This movie had it all. It keeps you entertained and on-edge. Ending blows you away.
At no point the plot loose the grip. I will recommend the movie lovers to give it a try and you won't regret it. Enjoy."
1438,"This was the best movie I saw in years , finally a magical cast with a spectacular story"
1439,Best movie of the year. The acting is amazing the story is new 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
1440,"Hercule Poirot would be scratching his head after watching this very clever film and the ""little gray cells"" would be going around in circles! You'll be scratching you head too on the way home! This is one of the best mystery murders I have ever seen! ENJOY"
1441,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked into the Icon Cinema movie theater in Albuquerque earlier tonight to see knives out. Knives out is... astonishingly good. I have seen my share of murder mysteries, and this thing is ridiculously fun. Between a well-crafted murder mystery, a great cast and wonderful performances by them all but ESPECIALLY Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer and Jamie Lee Curtis.There's a lot of mysteries set up in this movie and strangely enough, the tail end of the murder part of this mystery is actually revealed near the end of the first act. But from there there's still a lot for this film to reveal, like who did what, why did this happen?(I know I'm being vague, trying to avoid spoilers).As of my writing this review, I can see that 591 people have given this movie a 1 out of 10. My guess is that those 591 people have in fact NOT seen this movie and are little more than pathetic trolls trying to downvote this movie because of their comically overblown intense hatred for The Last Jedi and Rian Johnson.This is sad, because Knives out is a genuinely great film. Some elements reminded me of Agatha Christie's ""Appointment with Death"". Anyway I guess what's most important is that I had a great time. I was emotionally engaged by everything, and the funny stuff ALWAYS worked. Within the last 10 minutes you might find yourself laughing as hard as you ever have in your entire life. That being said, I HIGHLY recommend Knives out. It is an utter delight. This movie rocks!!!"
1442,"The people who gave this low reviews are prob those who get bored with a lot of dialogue.I, for one, found his film and absolute hoot!"
1443,"Let me just say that given all the press around this movie and cast interviews, etc...I had a pretty good idea of who killed Harlan. But the way it all played out was not only very clever but very entertaining as well. I thought Michael Shannon was a bit underutilized here as I happen to love him, but otherwise no complaints. Ana de Armas truly is the heart and soul of the movie and you definitely root for her throughout. As for Chris Evans...well, he was phenomenal. I actually prefer his non-Marvel work (Gifted, Street Kings and Puncture are some of my faves) and this one really shows off his acting chops in a huge way. I'm waiting for him to get the respect he deserves as an actor not just for playing a superhero but for bringing a depth and believability to his roles that is very unique. In short, see this movie NOW. I'm going to see it at least one more time in theatres to try and see if I can spot any clues throughout that I may have missed the first time."
1444,Rian Johnson finally subverted our expectations in a really really clever and rewarding way! GREAT MOVIE!
1445,"So yeah, finally watched this film. Had pretty big expectations won't lie after hearing how great this is and it's decent. It didn't exceed my expectations, but it matched them.
So, as the title says the storytelling was fantastic, really kept me hooked throughout. I typically struggled with longer films due to my attention span, but this kept me hooked in.
The cast and acting from all is brilliant as well. The film in general is just really well done. The twist at the end, in my opinion, took me off guard and didn't expect it at all and just overall this movie is throughly enjoyable to watch.Following negatives are minor ones and don't tarnish the film.
50% of the mystery is solved an hour into the film. Would have been nice not knowing if he committed suicide or not that early on.
Daniel Craig's accent is very odd
Would have liked to have seen more from the likes of Jamie Lee Curtis etcPs - Ana de Armas, if a 26 year old, northern lad from the UK is your thing then please DM me :):)"
1446,"This film should have had a British cast. The Americans overacting badly tarnishes the plot. And Daniel Craig, who is English, is a bull in a China shop, vacillating from false modesty to egomania but rarely finding the appropriate tone. Richard Grant comes to mind as an actor whi could bring intelligence and nuance to the part. This film could have been so much better. It speaks volumes about the films that are coming out these days that Knives Out gets such enthusiastic critics reviews."
1447,"* spoilers alert *
Ok... First of all, I'm not American I'm actually Egyptian but since I watch quite only American movies then I guess I'm aware of the situation... I will try to be short as possible... First the good things and then the bad things that made it a 4 for me....
Good things : a who did it mystery movie in 2019 that's pretty cool to look at and refreshing, the film overall is quite well executed, taking us from a twist to another and the pacing was good, slow sometimes but hey all movies are like that, i think it's intended to keep us anticipated for anything at the end, Daniel Craig's accent is dorky at first but i liked it with time and realized it would be boring without it, it added up a good amount of silly-Ness, i honesty can't complain about anything EXCEPT... Oh brother
The bad things : I was enjoying the movie until it has turned the family into a bunch of racist self entitled white people and the poor innocent hardworking illegal immigrant, just like that... It got political, they're literally speaking about trump ( not by name ) in a scene, and then the tune carried until the end with disgusting in your face symbolic scenes, like when Chris Evans talk about his ancestors's place and then they tell him it belonged to a Pakistani and later on that scene she pukes on his face.. Wtf.. And the big finale when the ironically privileged illegal immigrant minority wins and looks at them from above drinking from the my house my rules mug.... Another thing corrupted by political agendas, if you removed that from the movie it would be decent but no they had to ruin it, and most of Hollywood no are in for it nowadays, man what a sad time we live in where everything is manipulated and corrupted, even when you try to escape and watch a fun movie"
1448,One of the best who dunnit classics with an awesome cast and an awesome and wholesome crew who has made clear the 'whole donut hole-donut hole' picture!! Must Watch and Worth Watching!!
1449,"I really like the subtile message about the typical rich American family and their view of immigrants: Marta was the only hard working person in this family and yet, despite all the years she was working there, they coudnt even remember the country she was from. There are many more messages like that and I was really enjoying wathing it because it reflects the cruel reality of broad American despise over unpaid-over-hours hard-working, tax paying (yet not eligable to use any social security benefits) immigrans."
1450,So this was excellent writing and humour. Loved every minute of it
1451,"Unbelievable fast paced, brilliantly acted (by everyone, especially Ana De Armas), with enough twists and turns to keep anyone enthralled and captivated throughout the film.
This movie was on my watchlist for the actors and the reviews... It's now on my rewatch list!"
1452,"A bunch of top list actors, a boring story with a very dull climax. The hype on this film is so overated a blind man can see it. Another thing, Daniel Craig's southern accent was just horrible."
1453,"I would definitely give this film two thumbs up. I love a good murder mystery, and this one kept me guessing all the way to nearly the end. Lots of humor, lots of mystery, plus Daniel Craig with a Southern accent makes for a great movie. Can't wait for the sequel."
1454,It's quite a way how the story was written. The truth seems to be obvious and didn't expect to turnaround in that way. The fact comes out early to the audience but make me feel which parts go wrongs but I don't think anyone can get the clue of the part goes wrong. That's how it win my heart.
1455,"After a slightly slow start and a mild ""oh no, so many faces I'll have to remember"" mild panic, I was happy to realize that the characters in the movie are all so unique and well done, with great acting, that even for someone like me (who is terrible with faces), it took me exactly no effort at all to keep track of who was who. The unique personalities and their stories are artfully wrapped up in a bit over two hour movie - nothing feels too much, and very little feels too little.I was pleasantly surprised by Michael Shannon, whose character initially bothered me for inexplicable reasons, but he somehow turned it in a masterfun performance. All in all the acting was a joy to witness and made the movie in and of itself worth it, aside from the interesting story and its plot!Even for those who are not so sure about detectives, give this one a go - it has an unique angle and, honestly, was just a fun watch."
1456,Cluedo come to life. Everyone is a suspect and the plot keeps twisting just when you think you're on the money. Please watch this it's fantastic
1457,"A masterpiece murder mystery, top notch acting and writing. Rian Johnson's best movie. Highly recommended."
1458,"Rian Johnson completed an amazing screenplay that grabs you from the start of this movie and whats better than getting the actors that are perfect for this screenplay? All of these actors were terrific, especially the beautiful Ana De Armas. This movie keeps you pulled in and the twist isn't really what you expect which adds on more layers of shock value."
1459,"I Really enjoyed this delightful, well written film.
It was acted perfectly tongue in check by the cast, especially Daniel Craig who was superb throughout. Made me laugh and had a great ending, something that's in short supply these days!
I hope more of these are made.
Highly recommended by me!"
1460,One of the best movies I have seen in awhile.It kept me on the edge of my goddamn scene the whole time. It was fire.
1461,"Good ending. And plot twists. Def top 3 movies I've ever seen.Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time, and it all unraveled at the end of the movie and absolutely amazing."
1462,Was afraid it was going to be a typical murder mystery but it was promisingly surprising - just the right amount of plot twist your mind can handle. This has redefined my standers for the murder mystery genre.
1463,"Knives Out is a great, suspense crime film with an amazing cast.
Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana de Armas in such a good harmony. The film has extremely good camera work. I loved the film and the music. It is nearly a perfect crime film. 97/100"
1464,Best plot twist I've seen in a long time. It was just so amazing and brilliant at the same time. The writer producer and director did a very good job
1465,When I watched this movie the emotions really popped out and gave me a good adventure. I see a lot of 3-7 stars but really? This was a good comedy movie with good laughs and some serious in it witch made it a good movie. This deserves awards for its action and drama and things that just made it great. I think it is not a waste of time to go see Knives Out.
1466,"I enjoyed the movie but was confused at the end. The vial labels are switched by Ransom. Somehow Marta realizes she's given the ""wrong med"" to Mr. Thrombey. Does she know this because she somehow knows about the label switch? No. She simply didn't look at the vial carefully? No. Nurses always look carefully. And even if she made a once in a lifetime wrong med injection it wouldn't be on the exact same night that Ransom had made his label switch caper. Detective Blanc says she knew because she could tell the slight difference in the viscosity of the liquids to be injected (there were two). That can't be because it turns out she actually did give the harmless med after all and not the morphine. If she knew the labels were wrong due to the viscosity then she would have given the proper dose of morphine regardless of what the label said and therefor not gone into a panic. So what made her think she'd given an overdose of morphine? Am I the only one stuck here? Did I yawn and miss a crucial line?"
1467,This movie was absolutely amazing. a must watch 100%
1468,"It was hilarious, and the plot twist was unpredictable and mind-bending.I actively WANT to see this again, and that's something I've only said for 2-3 other movies in my life!!"
1469,"The patriarch of a rather unusual family commits suicide. Or did he? Knives Out is a great ""who's done it?"" movie where an eccentric detective, Benoite Blanc, tries to unfold the mystery surronding this so-called suicide.The songs are good and remembers me a lot of those 90's dark comedies, like the Adams Family. Acting is also great, everyone steals the show when on focus.The plot is good and keeps the audience attached until the very end. Plot-twists are done spetacular and everything runs smoothly and enjoyable.Overall, a good dark-ish movie for Thanksgiving."
1470,"This is a really good movie !!
Not my type, but I LOVED it !
The scenario is so inteligently written, the color palette is beautifully choose and put in stage.
The ending is JUST WOOOW unexpected (or not 😂but still awesome)"
1471,All cast members played their roles perfectly and Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig were incredible. Full of unexpected twists and really funny moments. The best film I've seen this year.
1472,"Lots of fun, great acting, kept you engaged, and fun twists."
1473,"Bloody awesome movie with some old school twists and Hitchcock styled ending. Loved the visuals completely and it gave a pleasant sight to my eyes. Literally i cannot able to take my eyes out of Ana De Armas, my god she looked like a princess in this movie i mean the way her make up was done, her cool costume, her south American accent(almost), her acting and most importantly her innocence in her perfectly round clean eyes made me fell in love with her truly."
1474,"Some good reasons to spend 2h10 'on watching Knives Out:
A good script that praises the beauty of a kind heart, with continuous knots from the beginning to the end, with the dream cast from classic movies like The Sound of Music, James Bond , Captain America, True Lies...A good detective is not only interested in finding the truth but also knows what to do with it.The image of the coffee cup with the words ""..."" appearing at the beginning & the end of the film is exquisite.Anyone who likes detective movies should check it out to play the guessing game who did what before the secret is revealed."
1475,"If they were to give it a go, this movie should justifiably be Rian's redemption from the harshest of his previous critics. For this is a really entertaining film. I found myself smiling with glee through a sizable proportion of the running time.Multi-millionaire crime-fiction author Harlan Thrombey (the wonderful Christopher Plummer) is celebrating his 85th birthday with three generations of his family in his ""Cludo-like"" mansion. But all is not well with the family harmonic and the next morning Harlan is found dead in his room by his nurse Marta (Ana de Armas). Apparently, it's a suicide, but when private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) arrives on the scene he starts turning over stones ""oin seearch ov tha troooth"" (sic) and dark secrets begin to emerge.Key to success of this Agatha Christie-style movie is a dense portmanteau cast and a well-plotted script. Both are here present.In terms of the cast, this is another candidate for the SAG Ensemble Cast award. For the cast is suitably stellar with Chris ""Cap"" Evans, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson vying for the top billing with Craig and Plummer. They bounce off each other joyously, with Collette taking my prize for top acting kudos. She's just deliciously over the top as the scheming hippy chick with the rasping voice and the cutting one-liners.With a starring role is Cuban bombshell Ana de Armas, here notching down the glamour to play the plainly dressed nurse. But she has a magnetic screen presence and is perfectly cast as the girl at the heart of all the action. She has the doe-eyed innocence that Alfred Hitchcock was always looking for in his leading ladies. Interestingly, she is soon to appear with Craig again as Bond-girl Paloma in ""No Time to Die"".Elsewhere in the cast are some interesting cameos: the family's lawyer is none other than Frank ""Yoda"" Oz; and the ancient security guard is M. Emmet Walsh, who has an amazing filmography going back to the late 60's.Writer/director is clearly his 'thing'. But Rian Johnson here pulls off a neat trick with the script which is brilliantly twisty and turny and 100% entertaining. Although it's presented as cuts between the 'present time' and versions of the night in question, the whole doughnut is never entirely in view until the final reel. It's a satisfying story, and some of the dialogue is laugh-out-loud funny.A nice plot point is the inability for young Marta to tell a lie without vomiting. Wouldn't the UK General Elections be Sooooo much more colourful if that was a general trait!!I've only the one real criticism of the movie, and that's Daniel Craig's appalling Southern drawl. It's really quite distracting. Aside from some witty lines of dialogue (""What is this? CSI KFC?"") nothing would have been lost to cast him as an urbane English detective instead. They could have slipped in some Brexit jokes instead! I appreciate Craig wants to distance himself from Bond somewhat. He did the same thing as Joe Bang in ""Logan Lucky"". But - sorry - it didn't really work for me then and it doesn't work now either.In summary, this is a really fun movie that a whole family with older children (the rating is 12+) can go and enjoy together. There's limited violence; limited swearing and sexual innuendo; and no sex (save for the Hitler youth in the bathroom!). But there is a whole lot of sleuthing fun to be had. Bravo Mr Johnson, bravo! For that reason it comes with a bob-the-movie-man ""Highly recommended"" tag.(For the full graphical review please check out the One Mann's Movies review on the web or Facebook. Thanks)."
1476,"Easily in my top 10 of 2019. Smart, funny and delightful."
1477,"So many twists and turns, awesome for people who like the murder mystery genre"
1478,"It's been a while since I've seen such a good movie! Great actors, great plot.. developing, interesting. Real fun to watch."
1479,"Let's be honest this year has been full of stinkers. It Chapter 2 was a near three hour comedy. Terminator Dark Fate bombed because it told the same story. The Irishman was painfully boring and overrated. Even Joker was overhyped, I liked it a lot but I don't think it's really a classic. But here comes Knives Out one of the best murder mystery comedies in recent memory.Pros: for one, it's very well shot. On a technical aspect the camera work and the way it's shot is great. The acting is superb nobody was bad in this movie not even Daniel Craig, his character was supposed to be over the top so I get the complaints about his southern accent but I thought he was great. The story was very clever, full of twists and turns that just left me guessing until the end. The small things such as the immigration theme and the vomiting all come into play and are very necessary to the plot. It's a typical murder mystery where you're trying to find the real killer along with the detectives. The dialogue was sharp and witty, very witty. I get it Rian Johnson ruined Star Wars for some, get over it he made one bad movie, he's really an awesome filmmaker. Don't hate this movie because it was made by a guy that ruined your franchise.Cons: I guess the social commentary wasn't necessary, I mean Hollywood just loves social commentary in almost everything. It gets annoying but it wasn't that bad, it didn't ruin the movie at all. In fact it was crucial to the plot. The southern accent by Daniel Craig was also hard to get used to at first, but when you learn his character is supposed to be over the top you get over it and you can't help but love his character.Best movie of 2019 and probably one of the best movies I've seen in theaters in a long time. It was fun, suspenseful, hilarious and clever. Please see this!"
1480,I went into this with no expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. Very well-written and the acting was superb. I enjoyed seeing Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson on the big screen.
1481,Great escape for the Holiday stress. I laughed and was entertained by this delightful Who Done It.
1482,"""This is a twisted web, and we are not finished untangling it, not yet."" Benoit Blanc (Daniel CraigIt's tough to mix crime and humor, but writer/director Rian Johnson does it well with Knives Out. A spoof of Agatha-Christie-like murder mysteries involving family, Knives is sharp with off-handed humor, especially through the sleuth detective, Benoit Blanc, who has a dry delivery almost as irritating as his ersatz Southern accent.The investigation afoot is the suicide of the patriarch, Harlan Twombly (Christopher Plummer), which Blanc suspects is a murder. The many relatives, all to benefit from a favorable will, are suspects. The house, of course, is gothic Victorian seen more than once from above in the now-common drone shots.The humor comes in turning upside down our usual expectations for a whodunit. A suspect immediately arises, and the resolution comes with innocence in the forefront. Neither of those circumstances conform to the usual tropes, but added humor comes from the expert acting of those who deliver irony deftly and subtly and the contemporary references such as Baby Driver and Juuling to make it modern.When Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette) exclaims about Benoit, ""I read a tweet about a New Yorker article about you,"" current culture is updating the old mystery formula. And it's all in good humor.
At times the dialogue flies between characters as if Robert Altman were running the show. Overlapping swift repartee can leave some of us behind, especially as we like to savor each word. Yet, the speed gives an energy to an otherwise not remarkably ingenious plot.The contradictions to the mystery formula are often surprising and fun. After a full day of Thanksgiving, including the often-thrilling mysterious dinner, Knives is a welcome joy and reflection, happily neglecting to murder smart-aleck patriarchs like me."
1483,"I saw this film today, and left wishing to see it again in the cinema - a thoroughly enjoyable affair, with a whodunnit with more twists and turns than the Nürburgring.Rian Johnson, who's a filmmaker I've always enjoyed - especially when he can operate without the handcuffs of a franchise such as Star Wars, which is easily the most stifled film to date - and has a habit of writing and directing films that don't quite fit a mold. Brick is a Neo-Noir in theory, but is also not, and Looper is a Sci-Fi that often isn't. Knives Out is a Mystery, but it's predominantly a character study and comedy, particularly with Harlem (Christopher Plummer) and Marta (Ana De Armas).Easily the two best aspects to this story are the contempory nature setting of modern day to contrast with the old school mystery elements similar to Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle stories to help make the story funny, and also the acting.
Quickly on the film's structure and editing, Johnson does manage to do several moments of misdirection; we are shown the truth vey early in the film, as with several people's recounting stories to the police, but the way that the story twists this is something that I think can be taught in Film School as setting precedents and placing details that people might not notice like a phrase, or a question that gets answered later in an organic way. It probably won't get acknowledged by the Oscars in either the screenwriting or editing departments, but it should be.Acting wise, this film is loaded, but the four main standouts are Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana De Armas, and Christopher Plummer.Daniel Craig, who in the vain of Logan Lucky, gets to do something a bit more funny and different than the James Bond films, and it's clear he really enjoys playing this Kentucky version of Sherlock Holmes, who is simultaneously believable as a sleuth - for he does uncover the whole truth - but is also able to make it not seem like a revelation.Chris Evans, similarly, gets to play a character who is the exact opposite of what he does as Captain America, where plays, essentially, a total tool. However, he's a total tool who still carries himself with a degree of charisma and who is watchable and identifiable - even if its the worst parts of him we're identifying with.Ana De Armas and Christopher Plummer respectively play Marta Cabrera and Harlan Thrombley, and are both the heart of the film. Marta is exceptionally likable, and clearly is representative of similar traits of Harlan - both are people who built their success from the ground up, with Harlan being a self-made millionaire crime writer, and Marta being a daughter of immigrants who works as a nurse. Marta is essentially the main character, and also the only one played by someone unfamiliar to Western audiences, as this enhances her appeal as a hard working person, and likewise Plummer plays Harlan like a man who cares for everybody around him and goes out of his way to help them, but is also firm when he needs. Both Plummer and De Armas could've played these roles as ""throwaways"", but both of them ensure that we're rooting for both of them until the end. Fantastic work by them both.I loved every part of this film, and I may even see it a few more times in theatres - I recommend you do too."
1484,"After giving us the godawful Star Wars movie The Last Jedi, I was ready to get my knives out for anything directed by Rian Johnson, but I was pleasantly surprised by this engrossing, star-studded whodunit. While its twists aren't always unpredictable, the film is still a whole lot of Agatha Christie-style fun, as private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) tries to unravel the mystery behind the death of wealthy novelist Harlan Thrombey, with numerous suspects among his family and staff.Is Harlan's Guatamalan caregiver Marta (Ana de Armas) responsible for her boss's death as she believes, or is someone else guilty? As the plot unfolds, one becomes convinced that Marta is simply a pawn, but quite who is making all the moves remains unclear until the very end, when all the pieces are finally put together by Blanc. It's an enjoyable ride, and there's more fun to be had after the film has finished in trying to remember all the plot twists and see if they check out. I'm satisfied that they do.With such a great cast (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Colette, Don Johnson, Chris Evans, Michael Shannon), the performances are solid, and everyone looks like they're having a whale of a time with the old-style murder/mystery shenanigans. If you push all thoughts of The Last Jedi out of your mind (a big ask, I grant you), there's a good chance you'll have a good time too.7.5/10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb."
1485,"Saw this tonight at an early screening. The writing is truly brilliant. Everything that happens is for a reason and really shows how much of a masterclass filmmaker Rian Johnson has become. The story is fun and engaging and always keeps you on your toes. The acting is also great. Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans are standouts. Daniel and Chris are very different characters to what they normally play and that's super fun to see. The family dynamics and politics is on point and hilarious. If you dig murder mysteries, you'll love this. Without going into spoilers, the storytelling is dynamic and I think it treats the audience with respect while also having a lot of misdirection and twists. Highly recommend."
1486,"I expected big things and it more than met those expectations it had everything twists, drama, comedy and edge of your seat moments a perfect whodunit and one I didn't guess in the first parts of the film for a change kept you guessing until the near end. The whole cast were phenomenal but Ana De Armas and Chris Evans in particular shine! A fantastic film by a fantastic director. Refreshing to see some originality and a fresh perspective on a detective thriller."
1487,"Rank 8 !!!! Are you kidding me?
A girl who throws up whenever she lies? Is it even possible?!?! And still it takes 2hrs to reveal her story of murder?!?!
A superrich man who cuts his own throat to save the girl from being convicted?!?!
Pathetic in all dimensions...
Collection of good actors + very bad scenario and screen play!!!
Waste of time."
1488,"Absolute waste of time, boring tripe. Also Daniel Craig was awful."
1489,"I had a feeling....
I tried to stick it out but as soon as vomit showed up I was out.Seemed like a lot of virtues signaling in the first 20 minutes. It's probably all downhill from there and I wasn't about to waste another hour on it.I liked all the actors but sadly none of them stood out and I really didn't care who did it in this whodunnit.I guess it's kinda like the Woke Agatha Christie. Did we need one really?"
1490,Boring boring boring why did this get high reviews???
1491,"Its been a long time since i enjoyeed a crime picture...
Since Agatha Cristi with Hercules Pouaro.
A great movie!!!"
1492,"Well written and well shot ,great cast .. I had to rewatch it to pick up on the little things missed, but enjoyed if equally both viewings"
1493,"Unbelievable. What an direction . And the story .amazing . an amazing murder myster I have seen after a long time . Beautifully written and executed. All actors did an outstanding job . The director did a phenomenal job on directing . Background score is also amazing . Its light and keeps you engaged in the movie . Overall the atmosphere of the movie is so suspenseful that you don't want to miss this. Can't describe more . Masterpiece. You should watch this . Will I recommend this? . Yes sure, if you haven't seen this then what are you doing . Must watch movie"
1494,"Had a lot of fun watching ""Knives Out"". Takes you in thrilling directions you don't see coming. Highly recommend seeing this on the big screen as there's a lot of awesome scenery to take in."
1495,"Very good acting and mystery plot; however, I would suggest an alternative title from ""Knives Out"" to ""My House, My Rules, My Coffee"". Movie kept the audience guessing. Intriguing mystery."
1496,"Knives Out has to be one of the best movies I've watched. From the writing right down to the cast I mean WOW!! Kept you guessing every step of the way. I don't understand why anybody would give it a 3 or a 4 or a 5 out of 10. All I got to say if you really want a good laugh, with twist and turns and a real mystery movie trust me KNIVE OUT IS THE ONE TO WATCH!!!!"
1497,"Starting things off with the cast, there performances are astonishing, there characters are so mentally rich as you know that the old guy commited suicide. However, you had a feeling that each one of them kill him, and that was an awesome feeling. The best performances was from Daniel Criag who has a character that is new to me, a detective comedian, sort of, plus Chris Evans who passes his shield to Anthony Mackie to become a bad guy which was so refreshing and good for him moving forward in his career. The ending is what makes this one a 10/10 picture because it is twisty and very interesting to wait for. Last but not least I enjoy the high class feeling of this movie, and I want to watch more movies like that in the future. The question is: Is it OSCAR Worthy? I would say yes. Which category? I don't know maybe (only) Best Picture"
1498,"This movie's quirkiness and ability to twist viewers even if you were paying close attention, enthralled me with enjoyment til the very end.Daniel Craig sold me on the carry with the whole joke of his character is that he's a Sherlock Holmesesque character, but since Daniel Craig is already British, (this is just a theory) they took us for a loop for Daniel Craig with a Southern Drawl to make it ironic since this film is just filled with irony."
1499,"This flick is the epitome of ""a good time at the movies."" It's slick, surprising, gorgeously shot and features the best Daniel Craig performance in years. Script is tight and the cast is obviously having a ball.Just go see it. You will NOT regret it!"
1500,"Knives Out - When you've been yearning for a murder mystery of substance for years, comes Knives Out to satiate all your hunger. It's intriguing, thick with a plot, has star appeal, is mounted on a lavish scale and is taut. It may not exactly be an edge of the seat thriller, but it has all the commercial aspects that keep the viewers glued on, pretty much like the yesteryear Hitchcock or Agatha Christie novels.When Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found dead in the morning following a family party, everyone is a suspect because each family member allegedly has a motive. The police however want to believe that it's a case of suicide and move on. Enter detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) who has been hired by an anonymous client interested to solve the case, the investigation starts taking sinister turns and no one is spared. The private nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) remains a central character as in her lies the answer to a number of questions and she can help take Blanc to solve the mystery.Director Rian Johnson spins an interesting web of lies, smokescreen and deception. There are ample avenues and attempts to steer the viewers away from making intelligent guesses about the real motive and the potential murderer and he is quite successful in achieving the objective. The conclusion and climax are quite unorthodox and uncomfortable. Starring Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Chris Evans, Don Johnson and Toni Collette in very important roles, Knives Out makes for a compelling watch. It will fill you with an appreciation for the runaway story, depth of characters, detailed scripting and screenplay and the rich backdrop. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas walk away with the honours in the histrionics department and Nathan Johnson must be applauded for the original music. Must watch film for everyone."
1501,"Knives Out is a great time through and through. Rian Johnson expertly weaves his mysterious threads to create another fantastic addition to the whodunit genre. The cast joyfully embrace their roles, radiating a playful energy throughout the entire film. Just enough structural changes are made to the classic formula to make Knives Out feel fresh and new. A few flat jokes and one minor limp reveal cannot ruin what is otherwise one of 2019's most enjoyable films."
1502,"As a fan of Agatha Christis novels as well as TV shows from the 90s such as Columbo, I can say I was pretty surprised by how good this movie was. I cannot remember seeing anything close to the Whodunnit stories I have read/seen back in the day. But Knives Out takes the cake, today. Along with a fun performance by a remarkable cast of A listers, Rian Johnson delivered a coherent and entertaining story for the genre, even taking it one step further - without getting into any spoilers.I judge a whodunnit movie on my capability to guess who the murderer is. The easiest it is to guess, the weakest the story. In that case, I was blown away by how the truth unfolded in such a surprising yet organic way. It just worked.I would recommend this movie for anyone really. It is fun, enjoyable and interesting. In a way it uses its characters to reflect various human flaws such as greed and pride, and uses the non linear narration to construct a consistent and convincing product.Big Up!"
1503,"Sit back and enjoy: if you like the cast, you will not be disappointed: they clearly had a great time playing off each other's characters. The plot twist was not as surprising as I have hoped for, but there were no dull moments either. I'm glad to see different genres being successful on the big screen - neither every script requires, nor every studio can afford, blockbuster productions."
1504,"So sad that this film only has 8.1 on IMDB. I don't know should I call these who made 1 and 2 stars stupid, but it is an awesome movie. While investigating the case, there are still so many funny parts, those who said the jokes are bad and not understand them are just truly boring people, maybe they just forget what is laugh and funny. The movieis fantastic and it deserves higher score."
1505,"A wonderful murder mystery whodunit with a great plot which has plenty of good twists and turns that will keep you guessing right up until the end. The writing is funny and quirky, the acting and cast performances are great, and although it does labour the explanation phase a bit, it's a marvelous production overall."
1506,"One of my most anticipated films of the year totally lived up to my great expectations. The all-star cast delivered a very entertaining film that gave us a great homage to one of my favorite literary authors Agatha Christie, yet managed to deliver an original and exciting entry to the genra. Would not have expected less from Rian Johnson, a writer director who does not know how to make a bad movie. I am so ready for more Benoit Blanc stories and I hope Rian Johnson and Daniel Craig keep them coming."
1507,Its a perfect mystery movie .....with twist and turn
1508,"....wasn't it pretty obvious that ""Captain America"" would become much more involved in the plot after departing so early on?
And why did the housekeeper think she could blackmail anyone when the blood test showed no overdose of morphine?
And just wondering: Why the heck wasn't the ""secret door"" ever locked? Still felt it was probably worth the time & money invested."
1509,"You might read a lot of skepticism about this movie with regards to it not being original enough, casting known actors to make up for the lack of a story, etc. But as someone who has seen this movie recently, I have to tell you that this is one heck of an entertaining movie. There isn't a single dull moment throughout the sequences and time flies before you realize that you were just getting started with the fun. That to me is the definition of a quality movie. I've always had my fair share of stereotypes associated with the murder mystery noir in a disapproving way but I'm glad I didn't let that get in the way of me seeing this during this 2019 thanksgiving weekend. I'd say definitely give it a watch and form your own opinion as opposed to dismissing it based on pure reviews, casting, etc!"
1510,""" Knives Out "" is really an intriguing whodunit mystery- thriller movie, with refreshing twists and turns. Daniel Craig, Chris Evans , Ana De Armas, and the rest of the ensemble cast have given genuinely good performances. The director has also made the movie in a brilliant style. The screenplay is very well plotted, and keeps viewers interested and involved from the beginning till the end.The locations are also great, and blend very well with the atmosphere required in a murder mystery movie. The dialogues of "" Knives Out "" have also been very well written. My favorite dialogue is when Chris Evans comments "" What are you? CSI - KFC? ""I highly recommend this movie - a must- watch for everyone."
1511,I absolutely loved this movie it's a real whodunnit if you love Agatha Christie or Clue this movie is for you keeps you guessing until the very end
1512,"Whodunnit films are the ones no one ever dislikes. Though it's a rarity today, Rian Johnson has directed the best of the genre in this decade probably. Every second of the film is interesting and it's one of the few films where twists and turns are actually necessary. Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas have given their career best performances. It would be a shame if this movie doesn't get nominated or win any accolades"
1513,I thought it was a thoroughly enjoyable movie with a great cast and some fun twists and turns. It is quite campy and doesn't take itself too seriously so basically Rian Johnson's Clue with some great scene chewing from Daniel Craig and Chris Evans.
1514,Just been to see an advanced showing of Knives Out. Great whodunit in the flavour of Agatha Christie. All the cast were great especially Daniel Craig . Could there be another with the same character. I hope so. Lots of fun. One of my films of the year. And could be a contender for an Oscar nod for the wonderful screenplay. As for the nay sayers because of the last Star Wars film .......get over it. Even Lucas got it wrong with 2 out of the 3 prequels!!!!
1515,Knives Out is a whodunit and hosts a plethora of interesting characters who remain within the roles of the genre's archetypes but doesn't become cheap tropes. The various twists and turns do not feel forced and everything has its place. One might say it fits together like a puzzle. Thoroughly entertaining from start to finish
1516,"Poor movie, really failed to get going & Daniel Craig is really going to struggle for a good part now he hasn't got James bond to fall back on."
1517,"This is NOT a mystery. It's certainly not a comedy. It's an extremely long, unnecessarily drawn-out, boring drama. Not one likeable or interesting character in the whole bunch, and a lot of good actors wasted. We are shown early on exactly who is to blame and what happened, and all the rest is just Daniel Craig hamming it up with an annoying accent.How is it that so many reviewers are calling this garbage a mystery or a whodunnit, when it is clearly neither? Have any of them actually seen this movie?I'm just sorry I wasted over 2 hours of my life watching this crap."
1518,"Rian Johnson gathered an amazing cast to help put together a movie that has you thinking from beginning to end... And then for hours after. The whole time with a smile on your face because of the twisted and never could have guessed it story line. Each character has their purpose and in the end you just want to start it all over again. Truly loved every minute and have no problem giving it 10 stars! Murder Mystery doesn't get any better than this. You laugh, you gasp, you laugh again, you get a confused look on your face. Totally worth it."
1519,Excellent! Not many movies like this out right now; I love the traditional whodunnit. Very cool cast as well.
1520,"Top notch output from all cinematic department. best murder mystery movie ever seen. All the actors in the film live with characters especially daniel craig, such a complete movie to enjoy in theater story and screenplay was awesome. if you are mystery or crime movie lover, must watch this movie."
1521,That's all I need to say. This film is phenomenal. The best. Thank you.
1522,"God in Haven, this flick beats the pants out of every other cinematic offering in 2K19. Well, even if that's a wee bit of hyperbole, this IS a commendable effort. Starting and ending with Daniel Craig, this actor has probably delivered the role of his lifetime, and in style. That Southern ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" drawl was real music to the ears coming from this dyed in the wool English actor. Never have I seen a murder mystery that's so entertaining drawing so many chuckles. And kudos to the supporting cast - they did a fabulous job. And the climax? Ohhh it was as sweet as and savoring as good wine sipped over a warm home fire. I give this movie a Titanic 10, thank you Rian Johnson!"
1523,"What a gear movie. This is probably one of the most brilliant detective movies of the recent years. To begin with, this movie does what each detective movie should do, namely, subversion of expectations. And it does it greatly at that.This movie begins with a simple murder mystery. At first, we are presented with a simple set of events, and we are left to guess who the murderer is. Seemingly, we manage to discover who that person is, and, unexpectedly, the movie actually shows us what happened. At this stage, we are left confused, since we are only in the first act, and yet we know who killed the guy. This makes us believe that the movie is not a murder mystery at all, but rather, a story about right and wrong, where we get to either side with the detective, or the murderer. Soon enough, however, we realize that perhaps there is something more to it. And sure enough, the story unravels in yet another direction, one that we've yet to discover.I find it simply brilliant how the movies keeps an incredible balance of atmosphere, mystery and humor. Writing a good murder mystery is very difficult, especially for fans of the genre, since there are only so many possible scenarios. However, this movie develops in a brand new direction, and it manages to achieve everything that it sets to achieve.Furthermore, this movie utilizes Chekhov's gun astonishingly. Usually, if we are shown a certain object in a mystery movie, we already know that it is going to play a role in solving the case. This is a good thing, since having redundant scenes in a limited screen time is not a good idea at all. However, camerawork is a tool just like dialogue or any other mean of conveying information, and thus it should be used carefully. This movie achieves to utilize this tool to a great scale without spoiling the plot or tipping us off, which in itself is achievement.To conclude with, the ending is very satisfying and it is probably one of the best mystery movie endings I've seen in a long time."
1524,10/10 - a unique and fantastic murder mystery with a talented cast (with standout performances from Toni Collette and Ana de Armas)
1525,"Knives out
2019
12A
director: Rian Johnson
starring: Daniel Craig,Chris Evans,Jamie Lee curtis,Ana De Armas,Toni Colette,Michael Shannon,Don Johnson,Christopher Plummer,Katherine Langford,Jaeden Martell etcoverall rating 100/100Knives out is about a suspected suiscide from Harlan Thrombey ( Christopher Plummer) on his 85th birthday with all of his family. But a murder investigation takes place when many members of his family and his nurse have motives for killing him and its down to detective Benoit Blanc ( Daniel craig) to figure this confusing case out. Wow what a phenomenal and clever film i could find no flaws. Lets talk about what made this film so fantastic.I have to start with the fantastic mise en scene cinematography. There was one clever line in the film that said that the Thrombey household manor looked like a massive cluedo board,and that's exactly what it looked like. The house was so big and had so many different parts to it that you didn't know where all the evidence could be. And there was so many different hidden doors and windows that increased the intrigue and entertainment value of the movie. And there was just so many clever uses of cinematography involving Daniel Craigs character that was fantastic. Including the wheel of knives and when he lit a cigarette and you could only see the fire and not his face. using low key lighting very effectively.Next the film was very funny and its mysterious tone was fantastic. The films humour was very clever in making you think one thing but then it being the complete opposite to what you thought. And also Daniel craigs charecter bought a lot of witty humour,the whole cast was funny in there own ways,due to them being oblivious as to how selfish and stupid they sound. i found this very amusing especially with Toni Calettes character.And also the script was fantastic,and the plot twists were perfectly executed. Wow the script was incredibly clever and in my opinion deserving of oscars. It consistently kept you entertained and invested in the story. And made you constantly ask questions about the film that was always answered and developed therefore leaving you very satisfied. It also had good social and political commentary as well. And the films plot twists was fantastic. The film completely turned the murder mystery on its head about halfway through the film which i love. But also it did such a convincing job at convincing you who killed the main character. But then it out of the blue was Chris Evans charecter which came as a complete surprise to me.And my final few main positives are the cast,performances and a the key standout performance of Daniel Craig. Can we all just appreciate one of the most impressive casts i have seen in a film in a long time. With so many big names everyone got there moment to shine which was great. And all the performances from everyone was solid. Especially Toni collete who played her annoying character perfectly. And Jamie lee curitis who also played her arrogant character very well with some humourous moments. And two of the three leads Chris Evans and Ana De armas did fantastic and convincing jobs in portraying the murderer and the falsely accused killer. But for me the main standout was Daniel Craig. He really made this film fantastic. Whether it was just the pure skill and talent that his character had as a detective. Or his witty humour and his fantastic accent he really made this movie.Overall Knives out is a truly fantastic. Clever and well put together movie. With fantastic performances and an incredibly well thought out and inquisitive script that deserves oscar nominations. And is truly my favourite movie of the year and up there with the best i have ever seen."
1526,"When I first saw the trailer i was thinking - this sounds very much like a la Columbo movie I've already seen and i didn't expect much, despite the cool cast. To my surprise the film was very entertaining, with funny moments and i found myself enjoying it quite a lot. Nicely done, I'd recommend it. 😊"
1527,"Knives out is written and directed by Ryan Johnson, a brilliant ingenious who had directed the clever Sci-Fi ""Looper"" and two of the most important pieces of TV ever made, ""Ozymandias"" and ""Fly"" of Breaking Bad. In his latest project he clearly poured his heart and soul into a brilliant script that drew a dream ensemble of cast elevating this picture into a level of an absolute masterpiece.Its build as an Agatha Christi ""who done it"" theme around the demise of an old wealthy American novelist in his house on the night of his 85th birthday party that all his family had attended. His family members are kind of parasites that collectively make a highly dysfunctional family. The suicide/murder mystery plays beautifully into a familiar story arc, but is quickly challenged by a new take rarely seen in this genre by throwing pieces of the truth (or is it?) into the plot with surprisingly very easy to follow style of editing, and this elevates the tension and engagement of the viewer to a new enriching level.Much can be said about the clever screenplay, wicked humor, beautiful production design, and the stellar performances, but what really drew me was the story within the story, and the metaphors delivered through this stylistic mystery thriller flick. Slowly you would see that each member of this family resemble something about the modern twisted capitalism of America that makes this ugly gray zone between what this country was and what it truly is. The true American is old and genuine who dies quickly in the very first minute of the picture. He is a writer, an artist, and a true gentleman who held grudges on his family after exposing their true vampire nature and thusly had an affection to the only true human in his house, his nurse, an immigrant from a country (laughably always missed by each family member). The family mostly, yet in a heavily condescending manner, show appreciation and admiration towards the nurse and consider her to be part of the family, much like the attitude of the serial killer white extremist family of Jordan Peel's ""Get Out"". The nurse herself is simple and kind who, as lots of foreigners in this country, are often alienated and reduced by aggression on one hand, and arrogant altruism on the other. Of course, the family is very quick in showing their true colors towards her when the circumstances are shifted, and also very quick in a shameless ""apology"" to her when things shift back, something that feels very familiar nowadays.Each son, daughter, grandkid, son/daughter in law has a unique element of the twisted and manipulated ""American dream"" symphony. The movie sarcastically reduces them into cheating bourgeoises, hypocrite preachers, pathetic beggars, evil thieves, and last but not least, into a mind washed anti-immigrant Nazi teenager. They pretend to be self-made individuals, but in an obvious sarcastic way, they are mere opportunists salvaging from the roots of a true passionate artist whose talent resembles the true American idea. The script doesn't shy away from these definitions, playing a clever game of dark-comedy by shinning the contrast between what America has been, what America is now, and what America should very much come again to be.What makes Knives out a masterpiece is that it has them all, the idea, the script, the performance, the production design, the editing. It is a very funny movie that shifts from the light humor to the pitch dark, a clever and maximally entertaining spectrum. It engulfs its qualities into an engaging old-fashioned thriller mystery, and finally weaves a socio-political commentary that works as a unique American story affected by the latest radical changes in its recent decades. It's an optimistic picture that sends a true necessary message of respect to the old, of criticism to the ""modern"", and to what true America should strive again to be. Without a doubt one the best movies of this century."
1528,"Rian Johnson's always been a strangely divisive filmmaker, and for the life of me I can't understand why. Not just The Last Jedi either (though that's the most obvious signifier of this), but I remember Looper getting pretty heavily criticised by IMDB users back in 2012 (check the top rated reviews- a lot of the highest ranked ones are still incredibly negative).Knives Out, however, is much more likely to be a crowdpleaser. It's incredibly entertaining and very breezy and accessible, and I don't say that as a negative. Not every film has to challenge or provoke or depress its audience to be considered great... though that being said, I can't help but feel like there's something missing here that stops it from being a GREAT movie. It's frustrating because I can't put my finger on why, but then at a point I remember all the things this movie does have going for it, and it ultimately doesn't matter that my gut's telling me it's an 8/10 rather than a 9 or a 10.Right off the bat, well, right from the poster, it's pretty clear to see how fantastic this cast is, and I'm happy to say everyone gives a good performance here. It's hard to pick a standout, besides perhaps picking the characters who end up having more screen-time than others (and honestly, in a way that'd almost be a spoiler for a movie like this).I was similarly impressed by how this movie managed to be very funny without feeling silly or like an outright spoof of mystery/whodunnit movies. It presents a multi-layered mystery that's easy to take seriously, yet never really gets too bogged down or overly gloomy. The humour's there and it almost always lands, but for me never really distracted or seemed out of place, and I think it's the sign of a truly great screenplay if it's able to balance varied emotions and provoke different responses from its audience. It's going to get compared a lot to Clue (1985) and maybe also Murder By Death (1976), though I'd say Knives Out is better than those on account of being just as funny without being farcical to the point of not being able to be taken seriously.Honestly, ignore my fairly petty suggestion that this movie's missing something, because to be frank I'm trying to do the same. Sit back, let the movie do its thing, and enjoy yourself. Coming up to awards season, with lots of serious movies vying for the attention of critics and awards-givers, sometimes a movie like Knives Out is exactly what audiences may find themselves needing."
1529,"Loved the movie as it transported me to the good old detective world of Sherlock Holmes meets Hercule Poirot - an old fashioned whodunnit plot (complete with an eccentric family, family fortune and of course the murder) in a modern setting."
1530,"Though not similar in plot, this stupendous update of the classic ""someone's dead in the manor-whodunit"" put me in mind of ""Clue"" because of its fun, out there characters and the huge manor house where the murder has occurred.The cast is especially fun and surprising because they're such an assorted lot, with not one of them an actor I'd expect to be cast in a murder mystery.Standouts are Ana de Armas as the caregiver at the center of the mystery and Daniel Craig with an Foghorn Leghorn Southern accent that's a career 180 for him. Hilarious!You won't figure out the end till the end. It's just a fun ride the whole way through. The only reason I gave it only 9 out of 10 is that it lagged a bit in the second hour, but it never bores me!Don't miss seeing this in the theater. It's a blast seeing the crazy expressions and petty behaviors of the characters on the big screen."
1531,"I cannot imagine someone going to see Knives Out in theaters and leaving saying that they didn't have a good time. Knives Out manages to be at once a true whodunit and also a fresh and modern take on the genre, and manages to have a great mystery, great characters and themes, and great humor. Rian Johnson's screenplays and visual touches have always been treats when I watch his movies, and they were on full display here. The script is really tight and so good, working on many levels. It is really challenging to write a good whodunit because you want to give clues to the answer but don't want to make it obvious, and this is now the primary example I'll cite of giving plenty of information as makes sense in the plot, providing some relevant red herrings, and tying it up in a way that makes perfect sense in retrospect. The script is also great because it sets up the characters really well to then show some significant social messages: how Americans can look down on immigrants, how the prospect of money can lead people to drastic and aggressive departures from seemingly more reasonable characters, the relevance and entitlement of blood relation, and the contradiction between feeling successful and superior as a result of inherited wealth while also claiming to be self-made. Seeing the movie from Marta's perspective heightened these themes and also was a way of flipping the script from the traditional whodunit detective perspective. Finally, the script is great because the movie is absolutely hilarious. I love Daniel Craig's ""CSI KFC"" detective (the lines about there being a hole in the case, like a donut, and then that hole seeming to be filled but really being another donut with a smaller hole inside the bigger donut hole, was just amazing), I love the running bit about them having no idea where Marta was from and just naming South American countries, and I love the way all the characters are played to a T, especially Nana, Joni (Collette), and Ransom (Evans).Getting into spoilers, the ending is really great. I was convinced the entire time that he had set his death up and left one last mystery for them, but that was just a really good red herring. The motive and the way Ransom acted makes a lot of sense given the unfolding of information and also ties up all loose threads very cleanly. Rather than having a twist for twist's sake, Johnson sets up a plausible and complex mystery with a legitimate solution but lots of surprises. The ending was also great in how it showed everyone in the family's focus on material wealth and never truly connecting with or caring about Harlan, while Marta did. She didn't play Go purely to win, she played to make beautiful patterns, same as how she lived with kindness. It never feels overstuffed or too complicated, but has many new twists and pieces of information that keep you thinking. The runtime absolutely flies by, as it's so energetic and funny. A great movie for everyone to watch and enjoy. This and Parasite have easily the two best scripts I've seen this year and among the stronger ones in my memory, so I'll be very sad if neither is nominated for screenplay (fairly likely)."
1532,"A disjointed family returns home upon hearing the news of their elderly mystery writer father's suicide, but was it really suicide? Daniel Craig's southern fried detective has been hired to find out by a mysterious client and he believes there might have been foul play.In Knives Out, everyone has a motive. The cast is filled with some of the brightest and most dependable actors Hollywood has to offer and the pacing never sags for a second. You'll be second guessing everything up until the final reveal. I'm impressed by how little the trailers actually spoiled this time.To say too much about the film would be a huge disservice to those wanting to see it, but I can say that twists and turns abound, no one is who you really think they are, the acting is fantastic, the laughs plentiful, and you'll have an excellent time."
1533,"If you are a fan of old school detective mysteries, this movie will warm your heart. It borrows heavily from some of the best detective works of all time (Agatha Christie's ""Curtain"" and ""The Murder of Roger Aykroyd"" come to mind), and I do not mean that as an insult.The acting is top notch, as you would expect from this cast, but I enjoyed the cinematography as well. And the director plays fair with the audience - it's possible to guess the full final solution to the mystery, but that does not take away from the enjoyment of watching the characters get there.The real triumph of the movie, however, is Daniel Craig's portrayal of private investigator Benoit Blanc. Craig plays him like a Southern Hercule Poirot - bumbling on the surface, but observant with a keen intellect and a flair for the dramatic. I would rather see Craig play this character again than play James Bond - and that's no insult to his portrayal of Bond."
1534,"Rian Johnson's love letter to the whodunit is a fun thriller that I can't wait to see again. Knives Out has a ton of twists and turns, but the heart of the film is Marta who steals the show with her honesty.I don't want to get into too many details that might spoil the film, but the final shot is awesome. This film cements Rian Johnson as one of the top tier directors. He's done a little bit of everything and he's done it all very well."
1535,"Ignore any noise being spouted from jaded 'Star Wars' fanboys. Rian Johnson is among the finest filmmakers currently working in Hollywood.Consider his resume: he wrote and directed 'Brick;' he wrote and directed 'The Brothers Bloom;' he wrote and directed 'Looper;' he directed the Breaking Bad episodes 'Fly,' 'Fifty-One,' and 'Ozymandias;' and most recently he wrote and directed easily the best murder-mystery of the year, 'Knives Out.'The plot is dense and brilliantly serpentine--just as one should expect from a quintessential film of the genre--taking on the characteristics of an ouroboros.Each of the characters in the film are familiar, flawed, and driven by their own delightfully selfish motivations.But it's the writing-oh the wonderful writing!-that makes this picture as powerful and poetic as it is. From the plot to the dialogue to the very last gasps of the denouement, Johnson keeps the audience completely rapt and on the edge of their seats wishing the saga could somehow continue ad infinitum."
1536,Go see this film. You won't be disappointed!Just the right amount of comedy sprinkled into the mystery.
1537,I see a lot of movies so I love a movie that I can't guess the ending and its even better when it's well acted. This has an amazing caat!
1538,"This is the most fascinating whodunit i've seen in my entire life so far. This is a well-crafted neo-noir movie that absolutely draws people's attention. Rian Johnson is brilliant. His works cannot be described in words. Like Brick, Looper and The last jedi. Wonderful!!"
1539,"""Knives out"" achieves an incredible feat :it is at once a spoof on and a tribute to Agatha Christie ;one can go as far as to write it's the best Christie transposed to the screen which is not based on one of her novels .
Everything is on the screen :the family feud ,the patriarch who rules over them ,whose will is the bone of contention ;the house ,an enclosed place where everyone has a motive to do away with sweet grandpa; the clichéed characters , with actors overplaying and making a brilliant use of cliché ;the screenplay even allows itself the luxury of revealing who cut the tycoon's throat long before the end.
And what about Hercule Poirot? He is present ,in the shape of Benoit Blanc (=White), a famous detective with a French (or Belgian more like)name , who will not even have to gather the whole family (a Christie recurrent feature) when he reveals the whole truth ;even Lady Agatha is here, in the shape of the centenarian millionaire's mom ,watching the detective, in a way ,her hero -she killed in her ""curtain"" book-
Like Pinocchio's nose grows longer when he lies ,the nurse throws up every time she does not tell the truth which is useful for the investigation.There's a lot of humor,sometimes black,with lines which hit home.The cast is perfect and has to be entirely praised;this murder mystery ,this cluedo , every Christie's fan must see it."
1540,"Pretentious, sideshow rubbish. If you want honest, methodical, murder mystery, read the Sherlock Holmes novels by Arthur Conan Doyle. Unpretentious, yet fantastic, utterly absorbing, and logical."
1541,"""Knives Out"" is a 2019 comedic crime drama directed by Rian Johnson starring Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig.
âª
All in all, Rian Johnson's take on the classic whodunnit outflings a fine collection of high gloss polished thrusting weapons, and every single one stabs precisely in the correct spots, as the cleverly twisted writing, the star-studded cast, the decent acting and the marvellous directing make for an ingenious and brilliantly constructed game of chess that, despite some narrative difficulties in the second act, leaves you astray smartly in most points and surprises you more than you will expect, entertains with its sheer star power and causes you to chuckle for its extreme cunning, thus making it a pleasant and successfully modernised work of a crime drama a la Agatha Christie.
âª
Now that Spooktober has ended and I can go back to watching non-horror films, I thought I'd start the new month with a more or less recent film. To me personally, Rian Johnson is indeed a capable director who knows to create unusual films and works. I liked his somewhat controversial direction in ""The Last Jedi"", and the ""Breaking Bad"" episodes ""Fly"" and ""Ozymandias"" are two of the cleverest crafted episodes of the enitre show. Many might not appreciate his works the way I do, so I assume that this film has a lot of bashers as well, but I for one liked it a lot. First of all, look at this amazing cast! Next to Ana De Armas, who should have received top billing in my opinion, you have a dozen of Hollywood's finest artists working. Next to modern James Bond Daniel Craig (as the subtly hilarious sleuth), you have Laurie Strode actress Jamie Lee Curtis, veteran actor Christopher Plummer as the patriarch, the heavily underrated Michael Shannon, ""Hereditary"" star Toni Collette, ""Sorry To Bother You"" lead actor LaKeith Stanfield, ""Miami Vice"" icon Don Johnson, ""13 Reasons Why"" superstar Katherine Langford, ""It"" youngster Jaeden Martell, ""Garfunkel & Oates"" satirist Riki Lindhome and even ""Captain America"" himself, Chris Evans, in a role where he uses a lot of language. The acting power behind this film is astonishing, and honestly, it is one of the finest casts I have ever seen in a feature film. Even if it turns out that most of the prominent names play only a minor role and in fact appear for a surprisingly little amount of time, seeing those utterly talented artists acting out their scenes is just marvellous. However, credit where credit is due, I think that Cuban beauty and wonderful actress Ana de Armas plays her role wonderfully. I mean, you see how many renowned and legendary actors and actresses star alongside her - only imagine trying to hold your ground in the presence of those legends and furthermore succeeding to play the protagonist excellently. She is the lynchpin of this fantastically twisted whodunit, and I can imagine her winning an Oscar in the next few years if she continues delivering so delightfully. Though the acting power in this film is one of the film's biggest strengths, it is the writing that perfectly rounds it up. Rian Johnson constructed a detailed and shrewd murder mystery reminiscent of the board game ""Clue"" and old-school Agatha Christie novels, and even if you can see that he obviously paid a tribute to those two influences, he knows to give it a personal and modern touch as well. The premise is quite simple: a patriarch dies untimely, and his family are suspected to have something to do with it, but regardless of this undeniable simplicity, the execution and further development make it so utterly ingenious. It is admirable how Johnson misleads the viewer multiple times and toys with their reception throughout. If it was murder, as detective Benoit Blanc suspects, all relatives, children and in-laws alike, would have a motif, but then something happens that makes this film set itself apart from the classic stories: three-quarters of an hour into the film it turns out that de Armas' character Marta, a nurse for the patriarch, injected him the wrong medicine. I was shocked to see that the mystery was solved after not even an hour and thought ""Why would he do that?"" and similar things. In the end, there turns out to be a second twist, but before it gets there, the audience is seemingly enlightened concerning the passing of their family member. And that is also one of the films minor flaws, because even if it ends up being a smart move, it inevitably effects the subsequent plot a lot. For most of the time, it seems like the case is closed, and as a consequence, I felt abruptly stopped. At first, I felt intrigued and wondered what the final revelation will bring to light, but then it is all suddenly disentangled. Thus, it lost a lot of steam and took a comparatively long time to regain its eagerly build up speed. Thankfully, the final reveal somewhat makes up for it. Even if it was an unusual and turn, it is no excuse for messing up the pacing and plot in the second act that much. Nevertheless, the ingenuity behind everything easily makes it bearable. There is a twist within the twist (insert Inception noise here) and that puts a different complexion on it. Seriously, you will not see it coming, because the love for detail and the way it gives away its details are stunning. If you think that it is all, there is furthermore a message behind everything as well, as it states that kind-heartedness is much more worth than greed and money. Thus, the film became even more touching. The greedy relatives who only used their rich father for their own causes come away empty-handed, unlike the one person who in fact deserves everything of the heritage. In the end, it's an enjoyable crime mystery that convinces with its story rather than with its cast, as it, as a matter of fact, only serves as some kind of bait, because as wonderful as they all interact, it is not essential for the film to work out. Overall, a marvellous and rewatchable experience that will please genre fans tremendously."
1542,This was by far one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. No clue how it got such good reviews. I thought this would be a lot better and it was just very disappointing.
1543,"Other reviewers have described all the flaws of this film more eloquently than I could. How the script achieved Oscar nomination status is beyond me. The Cast of characters never gelled in my opinion and were childish, superficial, loud and annoying. Daniel Craig's accent was unbearable and I was really going to throw in the towel until it seemed to settle down and become more tolerable in the last half hour with the emphasis being placed on a smaller circle of actors (notably the nurse and Hugh) ... and the action of the storyline driving us towards the reveal. I love a good Whodunnit and, sadly, this was not one. I'm so glad now I didn't go to see it in the cinema.... as someone else said it would be perfect to watch on a plane or train journey ... otherwise I kinda felt cheated and that I'd wasted my time especially when there are so many other much worthier shows to watch. Glaring holes in the plot, dogged pace, uneven and overly dramatic sound, unrealistic shallow characters yelling at each other like children, preachy dialogue at times, neither realistic nor spoof and a family not really deserving of their fate from what we're shown. Ultimately, there really wasn't a logical enough reason for his ultimate action in the first place so it never made much sense to me. ..
I would have enjoyed the film much more if it had been condensed into just the last half hour... without the need to put the name actors through a ""community theatre"" experience. I felt they must have been embarrassed to be in some of the scenes with their weak dialogue and lack of direction. In their defense they simply had nothing to work with so no chemistry or cohesiveness emerged. Very disappointing especially after all the hype."
1544,"So Im going to keep this pretty short. The trailer for this movie ruined the whole film for me. To explain better Ill just say : the trailer made this movie look like a great mystery. A mystery that would keep you guessing who did what. Well this was not the case. Who did what is something you learn pretty quickly, so when the big mystery is revealed in the end you go: wow! Thats lame and overly complicated. I also see no need for such a star studded cast. We dont see much from any of the characters at all. Talk about adding big actors for such boring and useless parts. Now on to the good: had the trailer not hyped me up for such a big mystery, then I think I would have loved it a whole lot more. Cuz all I felt while watching this movie was dissappointment. I was ready to pay close attention and look for clues, and then boom. Mystery pretty much revealed within the first fifteen minutes."
1545,"A very entertaining movie, especially if you are a mystery lover, supported by an excellent cast interpreting a bunch of colourful, eccentric, (somewhat) suspicios characters, one comes to expect in these kinds of stories. I particularly love how the plot meanders from a whodunnit to a howdunnit mystery and back again.There was only one element that I didn't particularly like - the throwing up. I think it was completely unncessary and often seemed like a cheap plot machine that helped stir the direction of the story way too many times. I read that the director wanted to be hard on the character we become attached to, by removing the thing she needs to do to save herself, her ability to lie.
However, in Marta's case, I think that was unnecessary, as we see that not only she can't lie, but she does not want to lie, as a lot of the movie revolves around her kindness and how that plays out. This is why I thought the whole throwing up thing was completely unnecessary for this movie, as I think the audience was anxious just watching this kind and innocent character trying to balance between covering up what she did and feeling like she shouldn't do it. Even without the throwing up she kept being effectivelly put in a position she didn't want to be in by other characters, so I just think this element was unncessary and cheapened things at times.Overall, it was a fun watch that I would definitely recommend it."
1546,"The patriarch of a dysfunctional, rich family dies unexpectedly and an investigation into the cause of his death ensues. Was it suicide or was it murder? His at-home nurse, also his confidante and friend, is intricately involved and plays a key role for an interesting collection of detective, state trooper, and private investigator. This film moves fast with quick and witty dialogue from and interesting amalgam of characters. The actors are top notch. In particular, I was fond of performances from Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer, and Michael Shannon. I love a good mystery, and this is a complex one told in a unique way. I had fun watching this one, given its interesting style and fast pace."
1547,"This is a who dunnit like I can't remember seeing. It's certainly not a comedy which it suggest on IMDB. It's a story about a murder of a wealthy patriarch and the private investigator who attempts to figure out what exactly happened. Daniel Craig is excellent. Actually everyone is excellent, this film did exactly what it set out to do. It even had a good ending. Props all around."
1548,"I saw this in theaters back when it came out and filmed a review for it where I was amazed at how early responses were so positive. I was sure at the time that the rating would drop to at least the 6s but here we are in the summer of 2020 and it's rating is almost an 8. An 8! Movies in the top 250 have 8s! 8 stars and above are reserved for the greatest movies of all time and this movie - to the majority of people apparently - is ALMOST that good?! The Terminator has an 8, The Princess Bride has an 8, Charlie Chaplin's The Circus, Hitchcock's Rebecca, Rocky and so on... This is that level?Well anyway, enough with that. Onto the review:From the second I saw the trailer I knew 90% of the outcome. Is that a bad trailer or bad writing? Probably both. But the fact that they were harping so goddamn hard on Chris Evans' character being the bad guy meant that either he wasn't or they were trying to make it so obvious that he then couldn't possibly be the villain. But then they make him seem far too nice and likable and that confirms that he most definitely is the bad guy.
The rest of the characters of awfully written with terrible political commentary taking precedent over actual character development. Christopher Plummer was the only performance I enjoyed and he was hardly in the movie before he died! Some have tried to tell me Daniel Craig was good in this film and all I could do was laugh! He was terribly unfunny in his... odd character portrayal. And his awful accent disappeared and reappeared between scenes. Awful performance made worse by the awful script.
Which brings me to the writer/director Rian Johnson. I haven't seen any of his other films as I missed Looper and never cared to double back and haven't been into Star Wars' sequel trilogy at all so didn't bother watching his one. So, it's not a personal vendetta I have against him or anything but after this film with it's muddled writing, pretentious feel, and lackluster plot I have no intention to ever see anything else he does. Not saying I won't, but at this point I have no reason to.
On top of all of the things I have already mentioned, the plot is also boring and filled with mistakes. There's a plot twist near the beginning of the second act that then leaves you bored waiting for anything else of importance to develop until well into the third act. This is extremely poorly paced and had me checking my phone constantly in the theater. And then as for the plot holes - I left this for last because it's so awful - the character of Chris Evans is supposedly the one who poisoned the house keeper. But it was plainly laid out to the audience earlier that an overdose of morphine would kill you in 20 minutes but when our protagonist finds the housekeeper hours later she isn't dead yet. This is just lazy and silly writing.So, to wrap it up... I have no idea how anyone could think this movie is above a 6. Frankly, I gave it a 4 and I think that's fair. But if you said a 6 I wouldn't argue with you. Anything above that? You're out of your goddamn mind."
1549,"Okay mix of Christie and Clue has fantastic performances, atmosphere, and witty dialogue. But it's seriously predictable, and I found it obvious who the guilty party was less than half way through the movie.Craig, Curtis, and Collette are standouts, but the cast is still solid all around, the direction tight, and the cinematography properly bland (this is a good thing). I found the symbolism typical of modern Hollywood, and even more heavy handed than usual, but I still had fun with it. My main issue was its predictability. There were no surprises to be found here."
1550,"Watching this movie in 4K at home during the pandemic was probably the next best thing to the theater. This film was stunning visually and cinematically. I enjoy a movie that can take your breath away with a single shot.I also thought the characters were well acted. The cast did as excellent if a job as you would expect when you first see the lineup. There are also a handful of well-timed comedic moments too which I appreciated.The big reveal at the end could've been MORE in my opinion, but it was still all well written, explained, and portrayed. Solid movie."
1551,I did not know what to expect. Pleasantly surprised. Intriguing characters. Great cast.
1552,The plot is a fairy tale. A successful novelist writes off his inheritance to a nurse without any serious reasons to not give out to his family. I left the movie as soon as that unveils after his murder. Kids may enjoy and loyal fans to start cast may still enjoy. Cheers!
1553,"""James Bond"" adds some awesome character to this. You are kept guessing interval after interval. And what is it with old people seemingly ok with dying at an old age in movies? I enjoyed this movie, that said, I wouldn't watch it twice. The ratings are initial experiences of movies that I don't want you to miss out on. Sometimes they have many rich layers these movies sometimes 1 time only. Still good. 👌"
1554,All I would have asked for to give it a 10 would be a little bit more suspense but I thoroughly enjoyed it! Definitely worth a watch!
1555,"Bored and a rainy day we picked this movie to watch. After about say 10 minutes I was ready to turn it off but decided to continue. I. Glad that I did not. While not the greatest film any of these actors have been in, I will say it was entertaining and a joy to watch."
1556,"For the most part, this is a pretty good movie, but it doesn't really get going until the second half. However, once again, Rian Johnson cannot keep his politics out of the script. (And this is coming from someone who for the most part will defend ""The Last Jedi."" (minus Admiral purple hair Holdo)) So much of it is focused on debates about immigration, and other politics. Why couldn't this have just been a mystery movie? When it satirizes the mystery stuff, it's done well, but, again, the political commentary is eye-rolling and distracting. I will say, Chris Evans was robbed of an Oscar nomination. His performance is by far the best one here, and this is a pretty star-studded cast! (It's kind of funny to hear him cursing, and at one point saying the F word, because of how many times he told people to watch their language in Avengers: Age of Ultron. That's some dang irony!) Daniel Craig's Southern accent is hilariously bad, and even the film points that out. I don't know if that was intentional, or if they just put Craig in this for name recognition. Either way, it was kind of weird. The political stuff is most likely why this nearly has a perfect score on Rotten Tomatoes and why it was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay, even though the film itself is just kind of average.
Grade: C- 7/10 3.5/5 stars"
1557,"Glad I did not pay to see this. The acting was quite amateurish, and I felt that the well-known actors did it very tongue-in-cheek. Will not bother to watch a sequel if there is one."
1558,Ana de Armas excels once again as the innocent-looking girl hiding a dark secret. You get fooled into thinking that the truth has been uncovered and then something totally else comes up in the end.
1559,An entertaining well crafted murder mystery with a lot of intricate details. No complaints!
1560,This movie was one of the best I've ever seen! If you like mystery movies this is the perfect one! I would recommend this 100%
1561,I loved the twists and turns and all of the actors were fantastic!
1562,"It was literally one of the best! It has some plot twists that just blow up your mind and its funny. Totally worth to see, might have some holes on the plot but it doesnt even matter because of the result"
1563,Highly recommended and such an interesting movie!!!
1564,Stumbled across this film by accident which tells you an awful lot about the film industry.Much better than any other film of 2019 as far as I remember.Watch it.
1565,"This film has absolutely everything. Humor, suspense, edge, twists (not in a bad way), and razorsharp dialogues. A mustsee if you ask mee."
1566,"Great story, good storytelling :)I found the last ""attempt by Ransom"" an unnecessary way to finish the whole thing!! The attempt was not even funny. Finally, I really don't know what brings 007 & Captain America together in this movie."
1567,"Knives out. Yes, this is the name of one of the best detective movies I have ever seen. So, my mark is 9/10. If you're looking for a good, intriguing, emotional experience that's your choice. And the plot is perfect. I hope you and your family will enjoy it."
1568,"It made so much fun to think about how it could be done, that I was sad when the movie was over. Great characters, a detailed setting, a perfect ending!"
1569,"Disc-laimer: Suspense, was a factor, not just for the who-dunnit on screen, but regarding when the DVD would arrive. Our ""short wait"" was a couple of months, I know first world problems....but my sons had heard about it and were looking forward to seeing it...and sometimes too long in that anticipatory state is a form of death.Anyways like ""Murder on the Orient Express"" (pick a version) it features a star-studded cast, and encourages its actors (like the characters they portray) to take things a little too far. The film, perhaps like many family gatherings, does feel a bit crowded. By the way, LaKeith Stanfield fans this is NOT the film you are dying to see.Anyways, like most mysteries, it gets reverse-engineered with lego-like precision on shots and plot. My intuition tells me there is a definite type of mind, for whom this works exceptionally... and I think my immediate family lacks that gene. Smells like Intelligent Design Spirit if you know what I mean.Which is not to say we didn't enjoy the film. One can admire the craft, and enjoy the romp (and even appreciate the not-so-subtle Matthew 5:5 message) without falling head over heels for a film.Like we did for Rian Johnson's debut ""Brick"" which is sharper than ""Knives"" and highly recommended if you've not seen it."
1570,"A classic Whodunnit set in a big old mansion.
If you crave for a modern day version of an Agatha Christie murder mystery this is definitely it.
A great cast, a story that twists and turns quite nicely has you engrossed til the very end.
Daniel Craig also manages to shrug off his Bond affiliation with a fine Kentucky accent, he is excellent as the master detective. That said, the whole cast are great to watch too.
There are so few murder mysteries being made now so this one is a real treat."
1571,"Wow, I was so amazed by watching this thriller unfolded. Simply incredible performance from all the cast and crew. A must watch for those who loves pure thrillers."
1572,Great plot. Awesome acting performances. Just an all around excellent movie.
1573,"This is a great mystery movie, no matter what people say. Now, you'll have to keep watching this movie until the end because the plot keeps getting better and better. I only retracted one stat from this because of some disgusting puke scenes, however without that it would be a perfect movie."
1574,"This movie will gives you the next level suspense on the murder mystery or suicidal...! Today's most of the Movies can't give you unpredictable ending or story, we knows what happened next. But I am damn sure you will not even assume who is the real guilty. The Story-line is just voilà, best ever story in suspense-drama genre movies. And lets talk about the cast....! Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc: A world-famous private detective in this move. But we know him as a #JAMES BOND 007 in INDIA in my opinion..HaHaha...! because of his some super-hit movies like Casino Royal,Skyfall, Spectre...and many more. His performance is just amazing, his acting is outstanding. Now come to our next character Chris Evans as Hugh Ransom Drysdale whom we know as #CAPTAIN AMERICA. I am also a big fan of both actor. So See them in one movie is also a best ting for me. There are many more actor whose acting is also just unremarkable. Na now finally come to the director and writer of the movie - Rian Johnson, i didn't' seen his past movies. But by this movie i'll definitely try his upcoming movie. So from my opinion ill give this movie 10/10. So guys just go and see this movie during this # lockdown and give more and more stars to get IMDB ratings 10/10 because i this it deserves 10. I skipped this movie because I thought there is so much drama and i don't like drama much, but this is just incredible I regret why I am so late to see this movie. I must had to seen this movie in theater. Literally it deserve this. This is my first ever review of those movies i have seen earlier, because i don't like typing. But this movie deserves this."
1575,"The plot is so twisted that at the end i strongly feel i need to watch it again. also there was a hint for every turn, but you might forgot it until later you saw the outcome.
the only thing hard for me to accept is that 007 has put some weight on! lol"
1576,"I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. Yes, Daniel's accent was awful, but in the end it actually helped make this refreshing atypical murder mystery even more outrageously fun. I grew up reading Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes, and the plot does more than justice to the genre. The twists and turns were delightful, along with the quirks of each character. Ignore the politics and just enjoy the ride!"
1577,"Bringing back the classic. Highly recommended this mystery+comedy movie to anyone who wants to watch a good movie!
Waiting for Knives Out 2... after pandemic?"
1578,"Although the truth of the case is nothing new, it's better to play in the structure, the rhythm is good, the lines are laughing constantly, and the continuous anti transfer plot is constantly climbing; everyone in the family is well-equipped, and I feel that there are many levels that can be mined and made into a mini play. All supporting actors from the police to the maid are too much drama, and the group play is excellent, showing the effect of a very stage play, which is worth watching."
1579,"The story is just excellent!! And the story is well delivered by Craig, Evans, etc.
I highly recommend this crime movie."
1580,"Although the truth of the case is nothing new, it's better to play with the structure, the rhythm is good, the lines are laughing constantly, and the continuous anti transfer plot is constantly climbing; everyone in the family is well-equipped and feels that there are many levels that can be mined and made into mini dramas. All supporting actors, from police to maids, are too much drama. The group dramas are excellent, showing the effect of very stage dramas, and are very entertaining nature."
1581,"Ah ha.. the 007 in a spy movie. How fascinating.. truly wonderful cinema, and a good climax as well"
1582,"Murder mystery set in New England; Craig plays old school detective. Lots of twists and turns, shocks you at every turn. Fun vibe around the movie, all characters are interesting, and the story is cool overall really liked it, pretty special movie"
1583,"So Rian Johnson Directed it perfectly well and he wrote an absolutely amazing Screenplay. But another without a doubt Amazing thing about this movie is the amazing Ensemble Cast, all of them acted really good. One of my favourite Scenes is definitely the Car Chase because it is pretty good staged and looks good too. Plus the Costumes and the Score is good as well."
1584,"Simply Brilliant , Why would anyone rate this a 4? Why?"
1585,"I won't put this in my top 10 but I think it's definitely in my top 20. This flick is just plain FUN. A good old fashioned 'who done it' with some humor and lots of plot twists. If you think you got it figured out...... oops. No you don't.
I've watched it four times and loved it every time. I can't say that about very many movies. I'ld watch it again in a heartbeat."
1586,"An absolutely brilliant movie from beginning to end. The plot, the acting, the surprises... nothing but amazing. Definately worth watching!!"
1587,"This movie is a very good and a Very well made and i Really recommend you watch this movie
Thank"
1588,"This is one of the best movies I've seen so far, it's all twisted and the whole story is so well related."
1589,This was the most fun Whodunit I've ever seen.This was probably the only Whodunit I've ever seen.
1590,"Upon entering the theatre back in November, I had absolutely no clue what i was in for. But when I left the theatre in the car on the way home, for the first time in 2019 (I go to the cinema every week) we couldn't stop talking about how incredible the movie was, how funny it was how enlightening it was, how the denouement was absolutely perfect and satisfying. Just goes to show that this original screenplay is more than worth it, this movie (shot on film) is a true masterpiece and nobody should hesitate to watch it. I recommend for children above the age of 10 under adult supervision otherwise you are in for an absolute thrill that you are not going to stop talking about for weeks; honestly weeks. You'll have an incredible time no doubts about that, go ahead enjoy it!"
1591,"Truly incredible, hilarious, and brilliant the whole way through"
1592,"After a family gathering goes awry, with the death of the patriarch's death, a master detective to arrives to investigate.Director Rian Johnson returns to form in this wonderfully shot and edited murder mystery of sorts.Knives Out has a great ensemble cast, veteran actor Christopher Plumber is fantastic in his pivotal role. Chris Evan's gets to shine (leaving his ingrained Captain America role thankfully behind him). Daniel Craig, (wobbly American accent aside) is on fine form. Ana de Armas is notable and perfectly cast as the maid and main murder suspect. Jamie Lee Curtis and the likes of Don Johnson to name a few provide a great backbone.It may not have the on the nose comedy and theatrics of Clue (1985) or Murder by Death (1976), buts it's modern, sharp and fun with enough twists to keep you throughly entertained.A much needed refreshing piece of whodunit joy."
1593,"Ok, going in I thought this was going to be worse than people said because it's the same person who directed The Last Jedi. But no, its pretty good. After about an hour in you figure out that he did actually kill himself, which felt a little weird, it being a whodunnit afterall. I even thought after about an hour in, ""The movie should be over... right?"". But wow, they can really completely change your perspective on a character just like that. At first, I thought: ""Oh, Ransom is being a jerk to everyone in the family"" and after the family went after her for the will and her car wouldn't start then Ransom let her get inn, I thought: ""Wait, Ransom is an actual good guy"". And I thought that until the full story of Ransom was told buy Blanc and I was like ""Wow, he is a bad person"". Anyway, great movie."
1594,This was a thoroughly enjoyable whodunnit with a fabulous cast and we were engaged the whole time. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas were superb.
1595,"Knives Out besides being a thriller where every single aspect works perfectly is also a brilliant meditation on class privilege and entitlement. As we see in the movie, all of Harlan Thrombey's children would be nowhere without the money he made through his art. Linda for all her talk about being self-made had to take a large loan from her father to get her venture off the ground, as is revealed by her son, Ransom, who himself, as we learn, is willing to sink to any level to get his cut of his grandfather's fortune."
1596,"A movie that Move that I actually Felt I was in the front seatbthe whole Time, How Things Unfolded, The Mysteries, The Lies and Etc.Totally Worth My Time!."
1597,"If you know the genre, you know the whole movie, but that's why it's so great. The movie is truthfull to genre and got it to near perfection. The cast is amazing, all characters are great and actor performances amazing. The mystery is great and so is the plot. Sadly the final plot twist was so overused, it is amazing if you see it for the first time, but I have seen it too many times and predicted it easily. On the good side after that the movie had the perfect ending shot like ever for this genre."
1598,Detective finding killer...asusal my favorite genre it didnt fail to impress me..but kind of dragon with tatatoo movie...its like decent mystery thriller..
1599,He got me with the hole in the donut hole. Very good plot. Loved the atmosphere of the movie.
1600,"""Knives Out"" is an entertaining whodunnit with a stellar cast.Ana de Armas gives a standout performance as the honest Marta Cabrera.Daniel Craig's accent was a major distraction, though. I really couldn't adjust to his Southern drawl and it took me out of the viewing experience.8 out of 10."
1601,"A treat for fans of mistery novels with an Agatha Christie/Arthur Conan Doyle vibe. Great cast but I gotta say that Daniel Craig's accent was, sometimes, a little bit exaggerated. Miss seeing more movies like this one with the sole intent of entertaining (in spite of the political and pop references). It was just me or that chair was a nod to GoT?"
1602,"Yes it is with full of twists , and very good screenplay , good directory , but it's just one big plot hole : why , why Harlan acts like this ? I mean common , he give his all the money to Marta , and then he just commit suicide just to save her for an apparent murder ? In the screenplay we didn't find anything out of ordinary about Harlan and Marta , yes she was good to him , yes he respected her but common it's just a little too much that a healthy old men when he finds out that he was poisoned (apparently) he's first reaction not the call 991 , or try to vomit or whatever , but kills himself just to save Marta .."
1603,"Rian Johnson, a name that makes many ""Star Wars"" fans unhappy. ""The Last Jedi"" was able to inspire many critics, but the fans ... They not only disliked the film, they typically exaggerated it and sent hate mails and stuff like that to the director. It even goes so far that some of these ""fans"" want to boycott Johnson's new film just because he made a ""Star Wars""-film that they didn't like. Pathetic!
But of course, this is about ""Knives Out"", the crime comedy that has so far been very successful. Why? Now maybe people are looking for a classic ""Whodunit""-film or maybe because the cast is so great? Who knows, who knows... The fact is the film is well received, both by critics and viewers.Crime writer Harlan Thrombey is found dead in his villa. Suicide. But that's just the first thought. Because the well-known detective Benoit Blanc is at the crime scene and is investigating the case. And Blanc suspects more than just simple suicide. One of the reasons for this are the countless family members who are more interested in the rich old man's legacy than in his death ...""Knives Out"" is an entertaining crime-thriller, but the words ""thriller"" or ""crime"" doesn't quite hit it. Johnson a movie that is more of a satire of a classic crime film. Well-known clichés and typical plot lines are skillfully twisted and exaggerated here. Johnson uses a lot of humorous approaches that work very well in my eyes. The dark humor in particular fits well into the film, but so does the more sensitive moments.The cast is one of the most important positive aspects: Daniel Craig as detective Blanc is wonderfully charming and funny, Chris Evans the rebellious black sheep, Ana de Armas the good-natured housekeeper and Christopher Plummer the dear but mysterious grandfather. In addition, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Toni Collette, Don Johnson and even Frank Oz are here and have fun with the material, which is transferred to the audience.Technically, ""Knives Out"" is also very entertaining and impresses with some interesting and funny camera shots. Nathan Johnson's score is very fitting and wonderfully over-dramatic, funny.Regardless the movie has some flaws. Maybe because I wanted more ""surprises"" in the end or because I was missing a little more insight into the smaller secondary characters. I can't say it exactly, but a little more fine-tuning and sharpness in the dialogues wouldn't have hurt the film here and there.Conclusion: Nonetheless, ""Knives Out"" is a very entertaining and well-made ""thriller"" that plays with well-known tricks of the genre and offers an excellent cast. Worth seeing!"
1604,"Full of respect for the famous detective novel Agatha, but also integrated into the director Ryan Johnson's own idea of keeping pace with the times, ""sharp blade out of sheath"" is a suspense film with classical implication and careful logic, during which a mansion murder case has created a mystery, but the truth of the appearance is not the whole of the film, the symbolism and satire of the political level, and the praise of the beauty of human nature. Have become the only point of view of the film out of the machine.In the cast, ""sharp blade out of sheath"" is not strong, the role of the detective is the former ""007"" Daniel Craig, and the grandson of the killed rich is ""the United States"" Chris Evans, of course, there are many old Hollywood faces starring, not to mention here. It is not easy to bring together a group of Hollywood stars, let alone how to make good use of this group of actors with good acting skills, thanks to Ryan Johnson's excellent control of the characters and the superb acting skills of the actors, in ""the sharp blade out of the sheath,"" the film successfully portrays a rich family picture with each ghost baby, especially Daniel and Chris, who have succeeded in tearing off the inherent impression of their previous films.The luxurious manor, the 85-year-old rich reasoning novelist Howard, died at home after his birthday, hoping to inherit the huge inheritance of the family, from the texture of ""sharp blade sheath"" with classical implication to the development of the film plot, ""sharp blade out of sheath"" is very much like Agatha's case detection story, but the first surprise of the film to the audience is that Agatha's development is not the whole of the film. It did not retain the truth to the final moment, as Agatha's novel did, but revealed the truth about Howard's death in more than half of the film, but what was even more surprising was that there was no bad person interested in the disclosure of the truth, on the contrary, the multiple reversals that followed brought the film into the new best part."
1605,"Knives Out is a technical masterpiece from Rian Johnson, and it's honestly hard to decide which of his films I like the most. I unapologetically love Star Wars: The Last Jedi, and I think I currently have Knives Out as my second favourite Johnson film, just behind Looper.There is so much I love about this film, but let's start with the cast. Ana de Armas is truly the standout of the film, and I also loved Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc. Knives Out had one of the best ensembles of any film that was released in 2019, and there isn't a single weak performance. I will say that some of the actors are under-utilised, but that couldn't really be helped with how many characters they had to cover.The screenplay for this film is absolutely spectacular, and I love how much attention they gave to every detail. Elements which seem small at the beginning of the film are picked back up later on, and, by the end of the film, we can see all of the breadcrumbs that Johnson was leaving for us. I have seen the film twice now, and loved it even more the second time.This brings us to the overall narrative of Knives Out, and it has one of the most compelling storylines that I have seen in quite some time. I knew what was going to happen the second time I watched it, but that didn't stop me from loving the journey these characters went on. That just goes to show how brilliantly directed the film truly is.The only weak part of Knives Out for me is the fact that the character of Marta has a condition where she throws up every time she thinks about lying. I don't know if this is a real condition or not, but it just felt extremely convenient for the plot and it took me out of the film every time this happened.Overall, apart from that one element, I absolutely loved everything about Knives Out, and I really hope we get the sequel that Johnson has said he would be interested in doing.SCORE: 95%"
1606,"Such a fun movie to watch. I was very sceptical about it at first I thought it was going to be similar to the old cliches with the same old scenarios but it proved me wrong. The director makes you see most of the clues through the eyes of the detective but like an illusionist and a master of misdirection it hides hints in front of you, which just keeps you engaged and motivated to look at everything through the detective's lens. Great acting and very entertaining!"
1607,Wow! Seeing Daniel Craig not be James Bond was the first shock. And then going through the movie where you feel like it's going to do the same thing of a family trying to get back it's inheritance are you almost give up but you hang on a little bit longer and it all comes together in the end. Daniel Craig did a fantastic job in presenting a powerful character that didn't have to be a fictional pseudo masculine man. The end is extrordinary.So worth the watch.
1608,"The story, the events, the surprises. Everything
Was great , I wonder how long it will take until I see such a movie"
1609,I really enjoyed it. Twisty murder mystery crime drama. For a time of junk movies coming out one after another this a great movie to break up the mess
1610,"This was difficult to stat focused at the beginning. at times so slow. then it picked up and picked up and it was a race to the finish.this was not a 9 or 10 like many commenters will have you believe. but the great cast and finish did it justice.
a solid 8.2"
1611,"Having read and watched countless whodunits over the years, I wasn't expecting a lot going into this movie. But the smart scripting, great acting from the cast members (shoutout to the ever excellent Daniel Craig) and some beautiful direction kept me glued till the end. The movie follows almost all the classic murder mystery cliches, and yet is able to keep you guessing for the identity of the murdered till the end - and that's the best part about it. For the fans of the murder mystery genre, this one is an instant classic - up there with Murder on the Orient Express and Murder of Roger Ackroyd. Even for the general movie going public, Knives Out is a worthy watch and certainly one of the best pictures of 2019. Christie would be proud of this one !!"
1612,But the background music is too loud though. It annoys me!
1613,"Was looking forward to this for a while and it did not disappoint. I cannot understand the negative reviews, or those that found it boring, yes there are no shoot-outs or explosions, but there is some fine acting (the always brilliant Michael Shannon), a well put together story, a few good laughs, all held together by a fantastic director. This might not be for Fast & the Furious fans, and that's why it's a great film."
1614,"Well this is my very first review of any movie ever !
And I seriously enjoyed this movie. While all the technical factors are judged by the critics I watched this movie as any regular person and the plot just was so intriguing that I watch the whole movie and I was impressed with the story. It was a full circle. Ended where it started.
I even waited for post credits but there were not any ! That's the only spoiler you are going to get in this review."
1615,"I came to watch it not holding any big expectations and it was surprisingly great! from the very start the story telling is well made but you have the impression the mystery shall be easily anticipated - the audience will most likely be wrong. this picture may seem phony from a distant look but dont underestimate it: I was emotionally engaged throughout the whole story especially the ending: I felt extemely rewarded for paying close attention.
it was funny, engaging and I cared about the characters, that's all I ask to a movie - to get me to the fun part."
1616,"Near perfect movie. It was tremendously enjoyable to watch. The story had me on the edge of my seat in anticipation, yet the comedic relief was just that. All the actors yielded strong performances. Beautifully written, beautifully designed. Really great movie."
1617,"Instant classic, nothing else written can explain this any further!"
1618,"I just love it! Until the last moment you didn't expect the guilty one. I really recommend this movie if you are a fan of clue or Agatha Christie.
The act, the cast, the plot every thing is perfect."
1619,"What an awful film, it's just boring, trying too hard to be like The Royal Tenenbaums, none of the characters are likeable, plot meanders along like an old dog."
1620,I loved this movie and was so impressed with the script. Its great to see a movie that is clever and treats it audience as adults for a change. It's the first film in ages that I feel I could have watched straight away again and got even more from it.
1621,"Clever and funny throughout, Knives Out is an enjoyable murder-mystery, both fresh and classic at the same time. Strong points include beautiful art direction and a fabulous ensemble cast -- Daniel Craig is particularly fun -- as well as the mystery plot itself, which kept most of my audience guessing the entire time."
1622,"Wnen you watch one of the detective films you (at the most of times) wath the same: crime, witnesses, clever detective, many versions and at the end you can know what happened truthly.
But! You will know what happened in the Trombey house at the middle of the film. Despite of this fact, film has very interesting plot with unexpected twists.
Actors' performance is the best part of film. Daniel Craig looks like real detective, or classic detective from novels. Others are wonderful too."
1623,"The setting with many suspects and a detective in the middle of it, the great revelation in the end which is quite different from what seems to be the case, the beautiful set- nostalgic and perfect, reminded me of an Agatha Christie novel with a modern spin and witty dialogues. Add to that, amazing performances by Daniel Craig,Chris Evans, Ana , Jamie Curtis.. it was a whole package."
1624,"I wasnt expecting anything going into this movie and ecxpected not to like it after the first 5 minutes, but when those first five minutes were over i was hooked. it slows a bit down around the second act but everything else is amazing. i love how its a spoof on old ""who done it"" murder mysteries but a moddern interpritation both in content and in format"
1625,Completely overrated. The acting is abysmal. Lots of ridiculous plot lines that barely make sense. Has more the look and feel of a TV show. This is my first review and I essentially signed up on IMDB because of the horrible movies receiving high ratings.
1626,"The story line is perfect for a mystery. There are so many surprises awaits.
I initially thought the atmosphere would be quite gloomy in the same way as the Agatha Christie ones, but the mood is actually quite uplifting apart from some disturbing scenes.
However, the moral of the story seems to be a bit worn-out, which makes the ending much more easier to predict. This sort of diminish the excitement of watching.
The set up of the decoration the the house is incredible, especially with the wall of knives. However, it does give of the feeling of a 20th century setting in the trailer, and I was a bit surprised to see iPhones appearing in the film."
1627,"So, this is nowhere near as complex a mystery as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, not as much fun as Murder By Death, but it is a solid outing and Daniel Craig revels in his role. Solid cast, story and direction, and refreshingly old school as a whole.But let's talk about the hype surrounding it, shall we? Before the aughts, this film would have been considered ""good, not great"" in relation to the mainstream films. The fact that it is hailed as a masterpiece speaks volumes not about this film, but the desolate landscape that today's mainstream cinema has become.So I guess we have to welcome this film as a refreshing outlier - too sad that films like this should be the norm, not the outlier..."
1628,"Turned out to be a bit of a mess in turns of the plot, it felt like they made it up as they went along. The film was longer than it needed to be, and the camera spent way too much time zoomed in on the pretty nervous girl, whose basic role was to conjure up as many facial expressions (some variation on anguish and confusion) as possible.It was obvious the old man committed suicide, so the whole ""whodunnit"" aspect of a supposed murder mystery was thrown out of the window after 20 minutes! And we all know Trump s*cks, but movies are supposed to be about escape, I don't want culture wars in my movies as well, thanks.This did not live up to the acclaim. And I just wanted it to end. And when it did I was underwhelmed."
1629,"Perfect 10 for the storyline, narrative style, cinematography and sublime treatment of the mystery. Rian Johnson produced something exceptional in the world of remakes and adaptations, It reminds me off the old school cult films with all the mysteries and puzzles to put together to solve a murder case.
I would say, brilliant filmmaking, a feast for the classic cine lovers.Though it is an original film, it draws some parallels to the 1964 released Hollywood film ""Woman of Straw"" starring Sir Sean Connery.
Knives Out is a lavish and more complex version of that film with the characters swapped but the idea's remained identical to the ""Woman of Straw"".All the actors are superfit in their respective roles, especially Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Christopher Plummer, and Ana de Armas.
I won't get into details in this review as the film is a mystery and you have to solve it on your own, otherwise, it would be a disrespect to the creativity and hard work of all the actors who acted in this film.Knives Out is a mystery, which you should explore through Monitor's screens or LED's.
Anxiously, waiting for the next film.10/10"
1630,"Apart from it beibg a rather entertaining movie, you get to see Evans as a really good bad guy. And the wondeful (and heartbreaking) performance of Plummer. His look, when Marta is scrambling to find the 'antidote'. Plummer shows how acting without dialogue (and even with only a singular glance) can convey the strongest of emotions.After the movie you really should read the trivia, and see how many you've got."
1631,"Very good acting, plenty of whodunit clues. Keeps your attention. Daniel Craig is excellent in his role. Entire cast does a great job"
1632,"A great whodonit with a twist. Clevere story, good acting, a pleasure tot watch"
1633,"As my heading says it's a cliche investigative thriller if you analyse the movie as a whole but it's interesting... You could predict the climax and endings but it's still engaging... I guess the credit goes to the director, editor and other staffs as well as the actors..
The only part which I felt low is Daniel Craig's role... His investigative skills aren't much shown and that was a bit disappointing especially since we were expecting a new Gen Sherlock...
On the whole my verdict is go and watch... It won't be a mistake"
1634,"The movie presented a nice mystery, with good thriller scenes and enough action to support it. However, most of the interesting scenes happened towards the end. Still, despite Craig's wierd accent, the characters were interesting and the mystery was not easy to solve."
1635,"I really like this type of movies , classic mysteries like ""Poirot"" or ""Marple"" and this movie was successful to bring back the feeling of those type of movies.
""Daniel Craig"" did one of his best performances in this movie, that accent was so great.
unfortunately my first predict in first 30 min of the movie was the exactly right one and that was a dumping on me"
1636,"Good solid comedic thriller Storyline it's structured like a classic miss Marple whodunit but kinda reverse with a twist and a heavy comedic touch. It had it's unnecessary lengths where it tried to be situtionally funny or smart but failed, so it never kept me glued.
Was not a fan of Craigs American(?) but liked his character alot didn't enjoy many other characters but that's expected. The whole throwup when lying thing felt just used in childish ways it was stupid and annoying. Car Chase Scene also very anticlimatic and weird.
It is cool that the movie always was honest with it's clues.
Acting at times felt a bit too theatrical but it was used that way to make it funnier but it didn't always hit the spot for me. The Knives Out Theme of the Vultures arguing over the Testament did never escalate in a dramatic way it supported the comedy and also didn't stress the film too much or just not as much as i thought it would.
Probably the pacing wasn't that good but the last twenty minutes were great - throwups.
An enjoyable Movie with that Sunday afternoon feeling though it is like i could easily fall asleep if i watch it a bit tired also i could argue about the joy of watching it multiple times.
Last notes Cinematography and editing was nothing spectacular Soundtrack also not so remarkable i expected a bit more when i saw the Cast and thought about the production value of course it isn't an actioner it just felt very static and oldschool, a bit of an hommage to the thriller classics in that regard maybe."
1637,"Good mystery plot of a rich man' killing and his unexpected will. All family is suspected along with a nurse. Brilliant acting by Daniel Craig (detective), Chris Iwan (Ransom) and (Marta) will bind you till the end. Background score is oldish but perfect for such suspense movie. Must watchable for every murder mystery lovers."
1638,"Usually i do not review movies but when i like it a lot, i must talk about it, the plot was good, the cast even better, every scene was important to the story, chris evans and daniel craig were a lot better, i will watch it again."
1639,"I really like the who done it story when done right, in this movie did so pretty good. found the barf gimmic a little out of place, but i can turn a blind eye for that. i enjoyed the film, and find it a very good film.7/10: very good"
1640,"Today I had the opportunity to watch Knives Out (2019).
This movie is one of the best movies of 2019.
well-acted, well-written, and well Cast. Everyone in the cast does their part very well. Especially Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, Daniel Craig. They all great and have really good chemistry with each other.The music is very good and adds to the overall tone of the movie.All in all, Knives Out is one of the most well done and surprisingly good movies of 2019, and the cinematography was great.
I highly recommend Knives Out (2019"
1641,"If you are someone who is a fan of predictability and simplicity, then Knives Out, directed by Rian Johnson (who also directed the very controversial Star Wars: The Last Jedi), is not the film for you. Most of the film is set at an old mansion, the Thrombey estate, which is almost a character itself. The opening establishing shot shows the mansion, enveloped in fog, giving it and the film an ominous and mysterious feeling right off the bat. After Harlan Thrombey, a successful mystery writer and the patriarch of the Thrombey family, celebrated his 85th birthday, it appeared as if he had killed himself in his study late one night. While suicide is the most likely cause of death, the anonymously hired detective Benoit Blanc suspects that there had been foul play. Detective Blanc interviews family members, uncovering each of their lies, and using his deductive skills to find the guilty party.
The movie is an exciting ride with a surplus of twists and turns that keep the viewers on their toes and excited for the next detail to be uncovered. The way the movie plays out makes you feel as if you are inside one of Harlan's mystery novels. Detective Blanc solves his crimes, notices clues, and carries himself in a similar way to the character of Sherlock Holmes, except Knives Out is much more realistic and plausible. With a number of A list actors like Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc and Chris Evans playing Ransom Drysdale, not only is the cast quite impressive, but their roles matched perfectly. Daniel Craig had the opportunity to let loose and be less serious than in other films of his like James Bond, embodying a goofy, charismatic, and genius detective that notices the smallest details and always seems to find the answer. Chris Evans plays the role of a snobby grandson that had everything handed to him on a silver platter, and he fits the role like it was a match made in Heaven. The costumes of each character are on the spot as well, they seem to tell part of the story about the characters. For example with Ransom, he is often dressed in expensive clothing and clearly doesn't care for his expensive things, it reflects how he is entitled because of his family's money and really hasn't done anything by himself. The setting of the film, the Thrombey estate, is masterfully done as well. It's easy to notice all of the knick knacks related to Harlan Thrombeys novels, and these objects along with the ornate decorations in the home add to the idea of mystery and the theme of wealth. Things like the chair with knives around it played an important part of the film as well, as different members of the family were being questioned, they were almost framed by the knives surrounding them, it also seems to relate to the doughnut that detective Blanc always talks about (you'll understand if you see the film). With a well thought out setting along with costumes, I'd expect nothing less than a fitting score that adds to the drama and mystery of the movie, and that's exactly what we got. With classical style music played by an orchestra and the occasional piano solo, it does a great job keeping you on the edge of your seat during an exciting scene and makes you really feel the drama and mystery of the moment. Over all, the setting, cast, costumes, and music were spot on.
The cinematography and editing was outstanding as well, capturing the mansion in an interesting way, emphasizing all of its details and decorations. Rian Johnson also relied on flashbacks to clarify who did what and when they did it. These flashbacks are used at the end of the film to helpfully wrap up the mystery and explain it to anyone who may not understand or hadn't guessed the outcome. Some say the plot was the same as every other murder mystery, they are not wrong and that's because it's a very specific genre, the name murder mystery explains the basis of each film, there is some sort of murder and then some sort of mystery. If you come into the film expecting anything more than a whodunnit style, you'll be disappointed, it's stays true to the murder mystery structure. Knives Out has a certain degree of predictability but also has many twists and turns that will take you by surprise. The mystery isn't as much as who killed who, but how the supposed murder was carried out.
In the end, Knives Out is an outstanding whodunnit film that is not only mysterious, but also comical and emotional at times, and it is definitely worth the watch."
1642,"Knives out delivers on every promise made.
You are in for a mystery with many twists, interesting and diverse characters brought to life by an all-star cast and witty dialog that enhances every scene.The murder mystery is done right, with so many unique characters that will keep you guessing. I recommend seeing this with someone, pick some remote spots so you can shush about some theories. You will get some things right but you will still be surprised by some twists.The movie introduces some serious aspects and themes in its dialogue but balances with witty and quirky one-liners that will make you smirk at the screen.Locations and cinematography are perfectly suited for this genre. You have a huge, old-school vintage mansion with a great wall full of knives that will pierce your attention from the first scenes.Conclusion: A well-balanced, entertaining mystery that stabs your attention and doesn't cut you off until the end!"

1644,"""My House, My Rules, My Coffee"" The film starts and ends with this quote, perfectly roping in the audience on what's to come. Writer-director, Rian Johnson may have his fair share of haters because of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but even most of his naysayers may had a hard time nitpicking this film. It's that good.Knives Out is a modern take on the old whodunit film genre, which came to prominent around 1930s. The best thing the film has got it going for it is probably its clever writing. From the settings, to the characters and dialogues, all of it stands out. Hell, even the set is good. So much so that even though this film uses the modern settings, you don't feel like it is. You feel as though the film is a period piece, even when there's continuous use of modern gadgets like the smartphone. It's probably down to the antique set objects used.Second, its eccentric colourful characters. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is easily the best character. Imagine the world's best detective, most probably would imagine Sherlock Holmes; he's sarcastic, annoying, insufferable know-it-all and very meticulous. This guy? Complete opposite. Looks stupid, doesn't pay attention to details, etc. The only thing they have in common is their eccentricity.He's also the funniest in the film. Couple with other characters like Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), and Jacob Thrombey (Jaeden Martell) and you got yourself a winner. Coupled that with funny situations and deadpan dialogues, it makes the film feels like a Wes Anderson film but with modern settings.Probably the only downside of the film is the predictable plot. There's a few plot twist here and there, but not to the point that it might shocked you. And considering that it's the genre core elements, it's a bit disappointing in that regard. But the film's more than justified itself by going on this treasure hunt like feel that's usually are in films like Indiana Jones because of its fast-pacing, which makes it more entertaining because of the rarity of how usually these films are paced.Overall, this is a very good modern take of whodunit movies and sets a very high bar on future films in its genre. Hopefully this is a new start to the genre becoming embedded in the popular culture again."
1645,"Knives out is a well written movie, old school mystery theme with bunch of stars"
1646,"When I went to watch this, my expectations were not only somewhat low, but also confused. I wasn't sure if I was getting a 'Clue' remake or some overhyped movie from the critical acclaim this movie had gotten, and I just couldn't make out exactly the style and premise it would possess, or contain.So I go into it and just relax, sit back and see what it's about. At first, it is sort of like a mix of quirky kind of humor with what appears to be a legit murder mystery, but nothing along the lines of 'Clue'. This was a lot different than that; there's no ""Colonel Mustard with the Lead Pipe in the Kitchen"" type of innuendo.But then the story begins to rapidly pick up steam with interesting writing, good acting, and a vibe that has you always on edge as to trying to figure out exactly what is going on.What I really enjoyed the most was how it got more and more humorous and became a comedy more and more as it went on. Some people may find this silly, especially if they had expectations of a serious ""whodunnit"", but for me personally, it was just exactly the kind of movie I needed. Some quirky scenes and details really hit my funny bone, and then combine that with a lot of fun and funny political banter and silly lines and characters, and this ended up being one of my personal favorite movies of the year.Fortunately, it will be nominated for Best Picture, Best Original Screenplay at the Oscars, even though it's more along the lines of a comedy and fun movie than something serious, which is refreshing. Not all art and all films that get award recognition need to be serious dramas or biopics."
1647,Brilliant film from start to finish with a dream cast. Keeps you guessing all the way through. Definitely one of the best films I've seen in a long time. Have already seen it twice! Even better second time round. Johnson should only make films from his own scripts from now on! Not to be missed.
1648,"This is a modern, fun, murder mystery movie. It's a little predictable at times but that could also be just me. Even that doesn't take away from the movie at all. Also the end was something I couldn't predict. A good plot twist, good writing and acting. I'd definitely rewatch this movie many times!"
1649,"This is one of the great movies about murder mystery, good thing about this movie is that this is based on lot more than just a murder mystery, I don't want to give any spoilers so that's enough to know and acting is so amazing just loved it."
1650,The first film in which I was always wrong with all my guesses!
1651,"Wonderfully written, interpreted by a wonderful cast!"
1652,"On the evening of his eighty-fifth birthday, wealthy tycoon and patriarch Harlan Thrombey celebrates (in a manner of speaking) with his combative family members, but is found dead the following morning. With the questionable circumstances surrounding his death only compounded by the issue of his final will, the game's afoot as crackerjack private detective Benoit Blanc is brought in to investigate, but upon meeting the patriarch's diligent eldest daughter, smug grandson, mooching daughter-in-law, and dedicated nurse, it's difficult to discern who--if anyone--is guilty of foul play. Wisely never taking things too seriously, this is a vibrant, voluble take on the whodunit genre with a unique assortment of characters, clever twists and turns, and an ending that doesn't cheat the audience. Craig gives a colorful, finely tuned performance as the debonair southern sleuth who may know more than meets the eye, de Armas is right on target as the vulnerable caretaker, while Evans has loads of fun in a role far afield from Steve Rogers. ***"
1653,"I gave it 6 because there are some good acting in this film, the plot was awful, no need for ""007"" unless you need to promote the picture and catch some more $. I know it is a low budget film but a better casting would have make it unforgettable."
1654,"This movie is refreshingly fun. I'm sick of boring depressing movies and shows that makes us think life just sucks. There are some lighthearted but dumb stuff out there. This movie is fun AND smart. It doesn't take itself too seriously and the mystery unfolds nicely at the perfect pace so it's never boring or patronizing.
Would I watch it again or ponder the meaning for weeks? Probably not. But I walked out feeling like I did something fun and enjoyable, which is what movies should be."
1655,Each character was presented in similar fashion initially. The multiple view points from each character made the recounting of the scenes incredibly rich with information. Each actor and actress deliver their roles strongly and with the plot pushes the movie along well. The movie is reminiscent of the game Clue.
1656,"I really enjoy this film, the script is incredible, I will recommend it to everybody, so great!"
1657,"Knives Out is one of the most entertaining movies of this year. It is funny, witty and suspenseful. My favourite things about this movie is the cast, production design and obviously the story.The cast was superb, Ana de Armas was super good in the movie but my favourite has to be Daniel Craig, especially with that weird Southern Accent. I thought it was weird at first, then I was quite used to it. Chris Evans also pushed his boundaries this time with his character and he did really well.This movie is shot really well, the light and colours are amazing and there are a variety of shots they used.The Production Design is the best about this movie, especially the house. That's one of the most beautiful houses I've probably ever actually seen. It feels luxurious and rich but also feels very homy and cozy, It doesn't feel unrealistic at all.The score really adds to the movie as well, giving it kind of a classic vibe. Like a fun murder mystery you see on TV when you were young which makes the whole concept of the story feels nostalgic.The story is gotta be the best thing about this movie. Rian Johnson made a simple story and turned it into a complex and astonishing story with charismatic characters that are very well written. As the movie goes, the more the plot thickens and it builds up. It is really worth the watch just for the plot itself.The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was some characters. You know they're there just for the laughs or as someone that you don't really know them and they come in just to kinda help with the plot. But other than that, everything is fine.Overall, this movie is really worth the watch. With great a great story, cast, cinemotagraphy and score. Knives Out is one of my favourites this year and definitely a 9/10 for me."
1658,"This movie was a twisted and charming wreck from start to finish, an investigation into the purported suicide of the patriarch of a family that was otherwise a den of vipers. Daniel Craig was delightful as a Kentucky Fried Private Investigator and I cracked up at his performance. It's full of dark humor in and among all kinds of twists and turns on the way to the explosive conclusion. And I don't think the butler did it LOL"
1659,A super fun movie to watch. Ridiculously well thought out. Ransom Drysdale deserves to go down as an iconic movie character. Every actor brought their A-Game to this one.
1660,"You won't regret your 2 hrs watching😘, am glad it got a high rate review cos it deserve it. The story was well written from beginning to the end"
1661,"Best film I have seen for a long time. Wonderful casting and actors all on top form, especially Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig. The whole cast seemed to be having a lot of fun with a very clever and amusing script. That sense of fun really connected with the audience. All the characters were well rounded and contributed to an excellent ensemble piece. Definitely a must watch!"
1662,A simple tale about a lousy murderer and a not-much-of-a-detective...Or is it? The movie keeps you hooked till the end. The icing on the cake is Craig Daniels getting into one of the most unique car chase sequences that I have ever seen. Truly a gem of a movie. Highly recommended.
1663,"Murder mysteries have become a bit of a dull trope lately due to lazy writing. But this movie is a gem!
Clever writing, good comedic relief, fun characters, relatable moments and so much more. It better than I expected it to be and definitely worth the watch!"
1664,"Perhaps I'm just old fashioned but, this movie has ALL of the components that make a detective mystery complete!Daniel Craig is probably one of the most adaptable actors around. He fits this part so well I firmly believe he could pull off the Pink Panther role in a heartbeat. And the rest of the cast are memorable and make this a great movie with plenty of 'twisty bits' that help to keep you wondering right up until the inevitable 'room full of suspects' scene.The cinematography is one of the greatest parts of this movie, the sets are somewhat limited (it's a manor house detective movie, what do you expect!), but if you have a tendency to admire the photographers artistry, you will with this. The panning and focus isn't something that I would normally notice, but in this it is carried out with utter perfection, which adds a depth of art that is frequently missed, or simply not present, in many of today's offerings.Synopsis: great set, great acting, great story and delivers the required caveats when and where required. Long but worth it.Note: would have been a 10/10 but I want to reserve that for the next Rian Johnson offering!!"
1665,"I thought initially that the movie was a drag, I was wrong. It was a good and satisfying watch. What a nice thriller for Christmas bingeing!"
1666,"If you find the beginning of the film a bit preposterous or even a little boring, please hang in there...it gets better! That was my reaction to the beginning of the film. It was nowhere near as funny as I'd hoped it would be (though it does have its lighter moments...Toni Collette's character is pretty amusing). While suspenseful and twisty, I felt that it was a fairly standard ""Agatha Christie"" type mystery. But the ending actually packed a wallop for me as all the threads come together and I realized that, beneath the neat mystery packaging, the movie was trying to say some important things about hypocrisy and kindness. Thumbs up!"
1667,"Not so much a whodunnit as a whydunnit. Tipping more than it's hat to the great Columbo, Jessica Fletcher and Scooby Doo, this is entertaining enough, but the bit players should've been given more to do, the script should've been tighter and the whole thing could've been smarter. It's enjoyable, but it never fully commits to the high camp it aspires to. It reminded me of a Wes Anderson film if you removed all the style, brains and humour. And Daniel Craig as Frank Underwood was an interesting character choice. Overall it felt rushed, contrived, lost its way, confused, not camp enough. Give me Clue any day."
1668,"I'm pretty sure the people that are mad about the ""political nature"" of this movie are the same people who love to dish it out but don't know how to take it.THE MOVIE WAS NOT ABOUT POLITICS. The direct political talk was, obviously, comedic relief. Hopefully even the densest of you got that. As for the underlying messages? Sure you could say that it is pushing a pro refugee narrative. But, ultimately, the decision to have Marta be an immigrant is entirely a plot device designed to help us connect with a character that we, otherwise, might not like. She was an outsider, had little to no friends and family, but worked hard and was kind above everything else. Yet, she wins in the end because of her good heart. Walk away from this movie with that message instead of being mad about an agenda that was hardly even pushed.Look I hated The Last Jedi. Hated it. I was nervous knowing that Johnson directed Knives Out. But this movie was very well done, funny while remaining serious and emotional, and empowering in the right way. It bashed greed and praised loyalty and love. So if you're hating this movie based on any politics that MIGHT have been in it, knock it off and grow up.Signed,
A conservative millennial libertarian"
1669,"This was fun and entertaining - a movie for grownups. Well written, well acted, great cast, and as much as I hate to say it well directed. Of course Rian had to get his political commentary in the movie making the conservative teen character a creepy pale sneaky deviant while the teen looked more mainstream than most teens look. While it worked for the film (unlike TLJ) the writers could have chosen a more neutral narrative for the family to bicker about."
1670,"Easily the second best movie of 2019, in my books at least. This movie is extremely entertaining, and really awesome. I loved it."
1671,Outstanding plot. This movie is over 2 hours long but trips by in the blink of an eye. I found myself busting out laughing a few times. I was also confused until the end. What a great ride. Enjoy.
1672,"The whodunnit was once a popular staple of TV and TV Movies. Peter Ustinov appeared in a number of adaptations and some of those were very mediocre.This movie is like one of those.As is usual there is a line up of familiar faces (none of whom act well) , some crimes happen and then there is a reveal.The reveal here seems to take up a tediously long time.It may be one of the better movies of the year, which is a reflection on the quality of current output.Set your expectations low, and maybe watch it on 'DVD' with a coffee break."
1673,"Want to enjoy a movie just for fun? Want to hear Daniel Craig sound like he's from Kentucky? (Isn't the idea of THAT funny enough?) Then this is the movie for you to just go enjoy after a hard week of work or enough holiday entertaining. From beginning to end you'll be guessing what could possibly come next? WHICH person is really telling these truth? Are all the detectives on the level? Why DID this once get hired? HE doesn't really know...UNTIL! I'd best describe it as ""Agatha Christie Lite"". Just for fun. If there was ever a reason to promote staying out of the sun, wearing a visor, using sunscreen moisturizer & NOT smoking, Jamie Lee Curtis is the poster child. She's 3 yrs younger than I am & looks MANY YEARS older w/her wrinkled face. Christopher Plummer NEVER changes!"
1674,"Really enjoyed this soft-of ""who-done-it-and-why-and-maybe-not-all-is-as-it-seems"" story with a great cast. Of course, Daniel Craig makes you forget that Bond guy in an instant as he seems to be having a great deal of fun. I wouldn't mind seeing him in a few more films with this character. (He really could be a great Poirot if he had the appropriate mustache.)Lots of twists and turns to keep you guessing all the way to the end. I left the theatre completely satisfied and thinking about how entertaining this film really was."
1675,More twists then your granny knickers edge of your seat stuff funny as foook all star cast great acting
1676,This movie will keep you on your seats throughout the whole time. Such an amazing story telling and acting. Definitely one to remember.
1677,"No surprises, ending was lame and it seemed like a rush job to finish the movie."
1678,"Great story telling and quite unexpected twists on a modern-day whodunnit. Some stellar performances from Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ann de Armas, and a huge supporting cast of stars. Starts fast, has a lull for a short while in the middle, but ends with a BANG (not a spoiler, btw). Loved it! Finally, an intelligent movie for adults that doesn't take itself too seriously."
1679,"Entertaining, funny, and exciting. I would recommend this movie to everyone"
1680,"First off, I'll say that true murder mysteries are not my favorite genre. My parents love this type of thing. I typically get massively bored about 20-30 minutes into a ""inspector so and so whodunit."" This movie held my attention and was very well done.Lots of people on this board seem to be latching on to political or social statements. I didn't really see this as some sort of statement movie.What I did see was a fun, well spun, captivating movie that was also humorous. A number of scenes got chuckles out of the audience. No uproarious laughter, but keeping a mystery light can have positive elements."
1681,"I enjoyed the old school Agatha Christie mysteries and this was reminiscent. They did interject some politics but I'd say they went after both sides. They were throwing insults at SJWs, alt right and putting both sides of immigration out there while a rich entitled liberal family fought for their fathers estate. Depending your political beliefs you could see whatever which was equally brilliant, the story and characters were entertaining. If anything I'd say the family characters weren't hugely developed but at a run time of 2 hours 10 minutes the point was made. I don't know the intent of the writing though knowing Hollywood politics I can make some assumptions and I still found it very enjoyable and funny. If you can't laugh at it you won't like it."
1682,I really enjoyed this. Don't overthink. Sit back and enjoy.
1683,"Daniel Craig is not an Hercule Poirot or Miss Marple. There is also a bit of a mix with Peter Sellers from Pink Panther at times. Still, this movie is fun, as all the pieces fit together nicely in the end. All the actors playing the dysfunctional family give their best. I think that Marta, the nurse, has the funniest weakness in all whodunnit movies I have seen.
I had hated Johnsons performance in Star Wars, but this movie is a hit!"
1684,Light and entertaining movie to watch when you are bored. The actors are all really good within their roles without trying to over do it.
1685,"Very impressive film, especially considering it was Chris Evans' first venture into cinema."
1686,"James Bond actor Daniel Craig plays amateur sleuth Benoit Blanc in ""Looper"" director Rian Johnson's elaborate, tongue-in-cheek whodunit ""Knives Out"" (***1/2 OUT OF ****) who describes the murder as a donut. He clarifies, however, that inside that donut is a second donut with its own hole. This convoluted crime caper is neither blood-spattered nor gruesome, so nobody need complain about anything looking remotely offensive. Indeed, we are given a glimpse of the murder victim after he has slit his throat, but the camera doesn't linger on this unsavory scene. Although profanity is held to a minimum, the F-word is uttered once, while the S-word is heard multiple times. Meantime, Johnson keeps everything fairly lighthearted throughout this 130-minute melodrama, with enough red herrings to keep you guessing about the identity of the killer. Mind you, the culprit is neither an intruder nor a blade-wielding maniac, but simply an irate member of a flawed family who feels betrayed by the family patriarch.Basically, world-renowned, bestselling mystery novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer of ""Waterloo"") appears to have committed suicide with his family ensconced on the premises. Thrombey's dysfunctional clan had converged on his secluded estate deep in the Massachusetts woods to celebrate his 85th birthday. ""Knives Out"" boasts a first-class cast, featuring Chris Evans, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, and Christopher Plummer. Veteran character actor M. Emmet Walsh also makes a cameo. Although it rambles on loquaciously for two hours and ten minutes, Johnson jams a lot of action and exposition into those two plus hours to keep it amusing. Each of the family suspects in this murder-mystery is given as close to a three-dimensional character as time permits. Not surprisingly, each has a legitimate reason to want Harlan dead, and they lie not only to the authorities but also to Benoit Blanc.Relying largely on red herrings (false clues), flashbacks, and testimonials from Thrombey clan members, ""Knives Out"" chronicles the investigation of Harlan Thrombey's death, which has all the earmarks of a suicide but turns out to be a homicide. Half of the action takes place at the Thrombey estate, while other scenes occur at Marta Cabrera's apartment in the city. An amusing car chase also transpires in town as well as a discovery later at an abandoned laundromat. Known as ""the last of the gentleman sleuths,"" Benoit Blanc assists the local constabulary in their homicide investigation. Apparently, following his 85th birthday party, Harlan Thrombey settled down for the evening in his upstairs den. After his nurse Marta (Ana De Arma of ""Knock Knock"") had administered his evening injections, she departed at approximately midnight. Harlan's grown-up son Walt (Michael Shannon of ""Man of Steel"") saw him later that same night. The following morning, Harlan's housekeeper, Fran (Edi Patterson of ""Troop Zero""), discovers his dead body and his slashed throat. While the police grill family members, Blanc lounges in the background, plinking on a piano. He shadows the detectives, but he doesn't believe a single word any of the family members utter. Everybody carries a chip on their respective shoulders where Harlan was concerned. Walt handled Harlan's publishing business, while the rest of the family benefitted from the elder patriarch's largesse. Nevertheless, Harlan has changed his will and written his entire family out of it! He has uncovered treachery on their part and punishes them for their deceit. Rather than turn his $60 million fortune and publishing empire over to them, Harlan wills it to his trusted nurse. Naturally, the Thrombey family is shocked. Initially, each had promised to take care of Marta. They treated her as part of ""their family,"" but now they urge her to return the money to them.Eventually, the truth of the matter, particularly Harlan's suicide, comes out. Nothing about it, however, is neat. As it turns out, Marta and Harlan had their own respective alibis. Moreover, it is ironic that things happened the way they did. One question that has baffled Blanc the entire time is his contribution to the investigation. He reveals that he received an envelope without a return address, but it came packed with a thick wad of greenbacks. Somebody in the family apparently wanted him to scrutinize all the testimonies and unearth something the police may have overlooked. As the audience, one of the first things we're shown occurs during Harlan's medical injections. It appears that Marta had gotten the prescription bottles switched, and she gave him a larger injection of Morphine than usual. Afterward, Marta ransacks her medical bag, but she cannot find the antidote for a drug overdose. Harlan realizes that he will die in several minutes, and he concocts a scheme that will not incriminate Marta. Furthermore, he also plans to commit suicide in an effort to conceal the wrong injection. Marta finds it difficult to answer questions truthfully. Moreover, she suffers from a peculiar condition which prompts her to projectile vomit after she tells a lie. Repeatedly, Johnson has a field day with Marta's projectile vomiting as a recurring gag.If you thought Daniel Craig was hilarious as Joe Bang in ""Logan Lucky,"" you'll be in stitches at his ersatz Southern accent that owes more to Foghorn Leghorn than Tennessee Williams. Craig plays a character diametrically opposite from his James Bond. Benoit Blanc is actually a little goofy as are most of the characters. Johnson ridicules all the Thrombey clan, except Marta. In the long run, Benoit solves the murder with a little help from the self-sacrificing Marta, and the guilty party is exposed. Benoit qualifies as the equivalent of the legendary Agatha Christie character Hercule Poirot. Furthermore, unlike his role as James Bond, Craig's latest character relies on his wits rather than his mitts in unraveling the tangled web of duplicity. The Thrombey Estate is something to see, and the multi-storied house with several flights and noisy stairs is the perfect setting for this quasi-Agatha Christie pastiche. Altogether, ""Knives Out"" qualifies as a cutting-edge, murder-mystery comedy."
1687,"Just a really great movie... feels like something fresh and new. Funny, smart, and a great ride. I loved how the mystery unfolded and kept me interested all the way through the movie. Actors all played their parts superbly. Just alot of fun!"
1688,"Nicely twisted plot, good acting, and BEAUTIFUL set all made for a very enjoyable film. The story is intriguing; Christopher Plummer and Ana de Armas portray their relationship convincingly. Actually, all of the actors are really into character.Perhaps those who hated the movie were expecting a more modern treatment (i.e., a shoot 'em up with a lot of skin) but this goes back to a style that puts the emphasis on the story; not a farce, but a fun tale, well directed and staged."
1689,"Going into the film, there was not much I knew about it except for the genre it was categorized under, which was murder/mystery dark humor mix, as well as family drama, which makes up for part of the film's humor. The summary is really all there is one needs to know to get into this film. That and the fact that it's a pretty substantial and provides a very entertaining premise.Acting was superb. Chris Evans (Ransom Drysdale), Daniel Craig (Benoit Blanc), and Ana de Armas (Marta Cabrera) really fit well in the roles of their quirky characters. The supporting cast playing the family members do well to contrast each other in order to create a family that's seemingly cares for each other on the surface.There are also undertones of politics which I believe to be done tastefully, enough to add (flavor) to the film's narrative and characters' personalities, but not to the point where it ruins the enjoyability factor by cramming political opinions and ideas down people's throats.This film is a sure highlight for the year and deserves at least an award nomination, particularly for its writing and directing."
1690,"First off, the cast --- wow. Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Ana de Armas, Katherine Langford, and that absolute treasure of screen and stage Christopher Plummer. In a single movie of normal run time it's impossible to give all these accomplished actors enough individual screen time, but every one of them plays their part to virtual perfection as various members of a dysfunctional (but rich) family under the thumb of patriach Harlan Thrombey (Plummer). His apparent murder sets off a chain of infighting and personal back-and-forth among his children, grandchildren, and their spouses that has the feel of just one more round of backbiting that they have carried on their whole lives.Everybody is excellent, but even in this cast Plummer stands out even though most of his appearances (as flashbacks) are restricted to the first half. He can dominate a scene just by being in it, and his delivery of lines is so effortless and commanding at a level that none of the others can quite reach. He's now age 90, so personally I'm saddened that we're likely not to see too much more of him. Enjoy.The two major parts are de Armas, Harlan's live-in nurse (and the only genuinely likeable person in the cast, so we have no trouble rooting for her), and Craig, as the detective aiming to solve the case. A lot of the superficial look-and-feel of the story is supposed to resemble an Agatha Christie mystery, obviously, and the script has a meta touch in that old Thrombey has made his fortune as a mystery writer. But it very quickly veers off into eccentric directions that make this whole thing quite distinctive. There are loads of details that make for a constant thread of understated humor: e.g. the detective is ""Benoit Blanc"", an obvious callback to Hercule Poirot, but he has a thick southern-US accent that verges on parody. No one quite knows why he's there in the first place, he seems to be rather a bumbling fool, but this is something of a disguise too ... no spoilers! All the action takes place in a classic crumbling mansion complete with secret passages, side stairs, escape ladders -- and there's a sunroom with a throne-like chair surrounded by knives that resembles the Game of Thrones throne, and even has a key part to play at the end. And of course there's creepy Great-Nana Wanetta (K Callan) who sits by a stairway window all day (and maybe night, we can never tell) and says nothing (""How old is she??"" ""Nobody really knows."") Without giving anything away I'll just say that things wind up pretty much the way they rightfully should.Knives Out is thoroughly fun and a great addition to the mystery movie genre."
1691,"This is an instant classic , full of twists and skullduggery and a huge dollop of humour .All the usual ingredients, the mysterious death , the house , the family , the will , whodunnit , the sleuthDeliciously revealed as the the plot goes on and keep you guessing right to the very endPad.A 9/10"
1692,"It's a rehash of Crooked House of 2017 based on a Agatha Cristie's Book.Not original!Thought, CROOKED HOUSE movie was so much better.The characters in crooked house are with so much more intensity...."
1693,"Very fun and entertaining. Some of the characters are pitifully funny, and hold up the story. Whether the story ties up, or its unrealistic is irrelevant. This is just comedy!"
1694,"Loved this! It was a smart and sly script delivered by amazing performances all around, and kept me guessing until the end. Living for Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc character and thick accent; Toni Collette channelling the most ridiculous Gwyneth Goopiness; and nice to discover Ana de Armas, who's in the new Bond movie out next year. Rian Johnson continues to produce work that I really enjoy. Definitely recommend seeing this if you haven't. It was a whodunit done right."
1695,A classic story re-told in a magnificent way. Extra points for the awesome cast.
1696,"The simple structure of the screenplay is fascinating. It starts with an introduction to both the characters and a basic idea of what happened the night of the crime. As the story advances and unfolds, it picks on each element established in the set-up to expand on it and deliver more clues as to what really happened.
Simultaneously, we're surprisingly revealed to the, we think, murderer. It's a beautiful case of study, because the precise murder is what makes us feel empathy for the protagonist, Marta. Then, we follow the story seeing Benoit Blanc as the antagonist that attempts to capture Marta. The film takes advantage of this by building tension and conflict and the loose ends of the murder. As things escalate, we begin to see there is something behind all that. The action and tension is impressive and non-stop and, even with a runtime of over 2 hours, there is not a single second that is boring.
The film uses every single element it established for turns, twists, or tension/conflict-building in an impressive way.The only 'but' I can mention is the climax that, for me, felt just a little underwhelming. However, this can be due to my own hypothesis, and I wouldn't blame the film for that.Overall, this is a must see."
1697,"Great!! Refreshing movie that keeps you guessing. It revived the classic murder mysteries we all know. The best adaptation of a ""clue"" game that I could imagine."
1698,"This movie is just amazing. I went to the movie last night to watch a golden globe norminee movie with low expectation due to Rian Johnsons last movie (Star Wars: The last Jedi). I was so happy that the movie didn't disappoint. It was just an amazing experiance.The cast in this movie was perfect. I loved Christopher Plummer role as a old, rich man (the head of the family). That role reminded me of ""All the money in the world"". Jamie Lee Curtis, Tony Collette, Michael Shannon and Don Johnson had minor roles but played them just fine. It was nice to watch Chris Evans playing another character than Captain America.The stars of the movie were Ana de Armes and Daniel Craig. Ana de Armes played the nurse to Christopher Plummers character ""Harlan Trombey"" and did a hell of a good job. She was so real and had alot of emotions. Ana de Armes definitely deserves a oscar norminee for actress in a supporting role. Daniel Craig aka James Bond played a detective who was hired to solved the murder mystery. I liked his character but didn't like his southern american accent. I like how he can play other roles than James Bond (i was a big fan of his role in Logan Lucky)To conclude this review: Ana de Armes did a really good job as did Daniel Craig. Rian Johnson wrote and directed a really good crime movie. This movie deserves some golden globes wins."
1699,"I enjoyed the hell out of this cleverly written, briskly paced, and brilliantly acted whodunit. It's a terrific film for the viewer who can go two hours without checking his damned phone.Here's hoping Benoit Blanc returns for more films!"
1700,"I love the old detective noir films. And this movie does not skimp on the noir. However, it does greatly skimp on plot.Pretty much, I'm sure the writer has read a large number of mystery novels. Conversely, the writer could not write a mystery novel of comparable value.This movie was neither clever nor intelligent. Granted, it was entertaining and fun, but it truly lacked anything but noir.There wasn't a single character introduced, or an element, or a""clue"" that I didn't understand the significance of at the moment. I kept waiting for a clever plot twist, or a mind blowing reveal, but those things never occur. in the end, I pretty much have things figured out as I had figured they would be figured out from the very beginning. I found myself growing impatient for the reveal because I just wanted to leave. I already knew how it ended.That being said, at least there was a general attempt at a clever movie. It wasn't a rewrite of a former, more successful mystery movie (though it could be argued that it was a composite of every former, successful mystery movie). My time wasn't wasted, but neither was it well spent."
1701,"So, the good news is, I enjoyed the movie.The bad news is, in its attempt to promote a pro-compassion-for-immigrants message (which I happen to agree with whole-heartedly) it falls short by having its many white male leads have all the clever ideas, mansplain all those ideas to all of us in the audience, and basically trample all over the intended heart of the movie, Marta."
1702,"Pro's: Great cast, very good performances, wonderfully directed and written, and very good uses of humor!Con's: Purposefully staying vague here, but it gets very convoluted. It really leans into it toward the beginning of the third act without realizing it.Final Thoughts: Though well-worth seeing and great fun, this'll be a better watch the second time around. Without giving anything away, there're a handful of small details in this movie that observant viewers will find impossible to let go of. You'll know what I mean immediately when you watch for yourself. You keep asking yourself how they'll factor into the climax/resolution, but quite a few of them just don't come back into play (See Next Paragraph). Very frustrating, but, as I said in the title, this'll be much less of a problem once you know what does and doesn't matter to the inevitable ""whodunnit""-style reveal (AKA your second time watching).
I'll mention one of those ""red herring"" small details at the end of this paragraph that talked about earlier. By definition, this ISNT a spoiler because it's quite literally irrelevant to the plot, but if you truly do want to go into the film totally blind, now's your chance to turn away.......No? Still here? Cool, so one of the biggest distractors in the movie (for me, at least) is undoubtedly the baseball. No relevance to plot at all, but they kept placing it front-and-center. Very irritating that it never tied in! It's not alone either. There're more, but that's all I'll say."
1703,"Thanks for making 2019 complete, finally a decent movie to end the year."
1704,"This film very much reminds me of a mixture of Poirot and Columbo. I won't bother talking about the plot as a lot of it is already there in other reviews, but I will say it does have an old fashioned 1930s fee to it. An all star cast help propel it along so it doesn't ever get boring and although the story unfolds one section at a time, it is quite cleverly written as to not give the game away too much until the big reveal towards the end (hints of Murder on the Orient Express loom heavily in the background).Whilst ome of the plot is guessable, there are still enough twists to keep it interesting. The cast are all uniformly excellent, and Chris Evans in particular stands out with his spoilt rich kid who may be more than he seems. Daniel Craig's strange southern drawl is perhaps the only reason I haven't given this eight stars. I did find it grates and his characterisation is supposed to represent 'quirky' but I couldn't help but sense the thinly disguised Poirot influence with him. Other than that this was a surprisingly above average film that tries to do something a bit different with its concept.On the whole this is a well made little film and I can see it leading to a sequel"
1705,"Funny to hear Daniel Craig use a deep accent again but he is perfect for this role of detective , and I love the 2 other cops as they work well together ! A bunch of funny lines and great acting in this movie ,, Ana De Armas is the real star and her part is also perfect .
This is a great murder mystery movie and I would see it again and definitely recommendCB"
1706,"Simple and short, this film takes the murder mystery genre and does a new concept with it. Things aren't always focused on the murder and there are more subplots that link into the main story. It's funny, it's intriguing, it's and 8 out of 10"
1707,"I had high hopes for this one because of the ads alone. The acting was definitely fantastic and the story had some interesting twists and turns. It was also rather funny at times.I was slightly disappointed by my own expectations. They were met but not exceeded. It was about what I had expected and I wouldn't expect it to win any huge rewards, but the movie was interesting and entertaining."
1708,"After exploding the internet with the controversial even if slightly underrated 'the Last Jedi' Rian Johnson is back at it again with the murder mystery 'Knives Out'. Daniel Craig leads an all star cast of characters as a Detective with a southern drawl and many other big names such as Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and more build up a set of quirky suspects to the murder of the Family patriarch (Christopher Plummer). Each of them have a motive and it's up to Craig to find the culprit. Some interesting information is revealed much earlier than expected and from there Rian Johnson subverts our expectations again and again (more successfully than in Star Wars) creating a pretty great 'Clue' like mystery that keeps you on your toes with Plenty of laughs and a standout performance from Daniel Craig. 8/10"
1709,"I don't think that this is a bad film. I loved the imagery, the characters, the mystery, and the humor. There are some laugh out loud moments (the knife scene, for instance) and some rather emotional moments (the scene of the death). But it's not a great film either, which is okay. It's got its flaws and comes across rather by the numbers once you get the hang of the story and it's direction.Most of the actors in this film are obviously big names and they own their roles as the various family members and detectives. But while this film entertains with its many quirky twists and turns, it always feels like something is missing, the standard element that makes a good movie great. The story is unique and exciting but it also doesn't go the distance it could have gone. There were many parts I thought were predictable, although I have to admit that I didn't know what direction the film was going to go until it almost got there. Despite this, I think this film is worth the watch, an entertaining ride, but there are far more important and prevalent films that have been released in the last year.It doesn't take itself seriously and you shouldn't take it too seriously either. In other words, expect to have some fun."
1710,"When Vivien Leigh was chosen to portray Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone with the Wind,"" some of the book's fans protested about a Brit playing a Southern lady. The casting was forgiven when she proved up to the task.Not so forgiving were blacks and Asians when whites were cast as minorities. Al Jolson in blackface in the first talkie. Marlon Brando as Japanese in ""Teahouse of the August Moon."" Laurence Olivier as a Moor in ""Othello.""Now we come to Daniel Craig, trying to be a Southerner in ""Knives Out."" It doesn't work. His New Orleans (?) accent is merely annoying. If there were a Southern Anti-Bias League, they would protest.Oh, the film. Once you get past the absurdity of the premise, it works well enough to rate it a 6."
1711,I grew up watching the mystery show Murder she wrote starring Angela Lansbury in the 90s. Currently I watched the movie Clue before seeing this movie and I was just astonished from the beginning to end so enjoyable.
1712,"I enjoyed this movie, especially going in not knowing anything beyond it being a ""Clue"" type movie.
Daniel Craig put on a wonderful performance."
1713,8 Stars. When I watched the trailer I didn't think there was a way this movie could break the 8 star barrier but after I watched I was wrong. The movie is highly engaging not predictable and all around a blast. I was never bored.
1714,"Without the classiness of Evil Under the Sun, without the slicked-back elegance of Murder on the Orient Express (1974, Albert Finney, thank you), without the slapsticks of Clue, without the wryly wrought gesticulations of Columbo, and without, in reasonable estimation, any further need for a fresh take on the genre of murder-mystery movies, Rian Johnson has, in a generally self-aggrandizing way, assembled a star-studded cast of loathsome characters to act out farcical intrigue crossing the finish line through a crisp 130 minutes of obfuscation-cum-revelation, or maybe it was all just Quentin Tarantino's tenth film?Although that all sounds positive, and Christopher Plummer continues to prove he can command the screen despite never having been in a Star Wars movie, something which neither Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Alec Guinness, nor Max von Sydow can add to their resumes, one cannot help but question the choice of Daniel Craig as a southern gentleman with folksy dialogue and an almost laughable attempt at a Texas drawl.A lot of laughs were left on the table by not imbuing the main detective with funnier features. Imagine a French (or perhaps, Flemish) accent, a monocle, a lazy eye, a large gut, a handlebar mustache, jet-black and slicked-back hair under a hairnet, a double limp, two humps, and some pocket watches which are never accurate unless you want to know what time it is in Flanders.It was a very good choice to have Chris Evans wear civilian clothes, however."
1715,"I saw the movie yesterday... it was a very nice funny over the top acted B movie ...
Toni collette was the best ... really funny actress to give all those lines with straight face Is amazing..."
1716,"The plot was Great and amazing Humor of The Cast. It very good mystery film who kill the father//owner of the house.The plot twist was very well done and i wish the ending should have different ending who kill him like Glue film; which I love that film also. This was very entertaining and fun to watch.
My review🍗🍾9.5/10 IMDb 4.5/5.0 stars🔪"
1717,"Knives Out is a murder mystery movie through and through, echoing Sherlock, Poirot, and Murder She Wrote. But being a Rian Johnson movie, there's more beneath the surface than the obvious callbacks and parodies. If you go into this movie feeling like you know the outcome, you're wrong. This is a mystery cliché-free zone. The movie opens with the apparent suicide of a successful murder mystery author and the subsequent gathering of his family for the funeral, memorial, and will reading. Meanwhile a private detective has been hired by an anonymous client to look further into the suicide, with the full resources of the local police department behind him.The biggest and earliest cliché dodge of the movie is in revealing the details of Harlan Thrombey's death in the first half an hour. Yes, this is a murder mystery where the murder is solved (at least for the audience) really early. It's an inspiring choice that goes a long way to setting up the rest of the movie. We then follow the cover-up underneath Benoit Blanc's nose the entire time, giving us a fresh and new perspective in an otherwise overdone and tired genre. But don't let this lull you into thinking there's no mystery to be had. The explanation we get is still riddled with holes (doughnut holes, to be more precise), and there's the ever-pervading mystery of who hired Benoit Blanc in the first place, and why. I know what you're thinking, because I was thinking it too, but no, that's not the big twist at the end either.But Knives Out's success lies in not only the unpredictable twist, but the ingenious journey there. The climax of the movie is neither plainly obvious, but nor is it a complete left hook, coming out of nowhere based on no evidence, or on evidence only Benoit Blanc has seen, or on an overabundance of evidence and red herrings, nor is it so outlandish it borders on the unbelievable. The hints and clues are there throughout the movie if you're keen enough to catch them. I caught a couple myself, but had no way of applying them or even knowing they were clues until the final reveal at the end. By the time the credits have rolled, every loose end has been neatly tied up, and every set-up paid off in one way or another. There's an obvious set-up in the prop knife, but also keep a look out for the baseball and make sure you track its movements as the movie goes on, as well as the odd line and snippet of information offered by the characters, particularly around games.There's more to Knives Out than just the murder mystery though. For starters the cinematography is electric. It may not be so obvious as some of Johnson's previous work, but there's still some great cinematic shots to enjoy. Examples include Benoit's face bathed in shadow as he lights his cigar, or Meg's illuminated eyes while on the phone to Marta. Likewise the soundtrack perfectly embodies the murder mystery genre and makes you feel right at home as soon as the movie begins. It won't win any awards, but it suits the movie and does its job.Somewhat surprisingly there's also a level of comey throughout. Never quite laugh-out-loud hilarious, but there's plenty of jokes and running gags. Daniel Craig in particular seems to be having a lot of fun with this movie, putting on an over-the-top southern drawl, and coming out with lines such as ""The Nazi child masturbating in the bathroom"" and ""The doughnut had a hole in the middle that was filled by another doughnut, your doughnut, but your doughnut also has a hole in the middle"". Surprisingly Michael Shannon has a selection of fantastic lines as well, such as ""I will not eat one iota of sh*t"" and ""You want a cookie now?!"" Chris Evans is another one quite obviously having a great time as a smarmy git, in stark contrast to his Captain America persona (sorry dude, you will always be compared to your most iconic role).On the note of acting, it was great to see Ana de Armas in the leading role (no, this is not Daniel Craig's movie), and not once did her insane attractiveness come up or be exemplified over her role in the story. She was her character and played her role like any other actor, proving that she absolutely has the acting chops capable of carrying an entire movie on her shoulders. Toni Collette is another stand-out as a privileged fashion/health guru, as is Christopher Plummer as the unfortunate Harlan Thrombey. And it was nice to actually see Frank Oz again, in his first live-action role in nearly twenty years.Knives Out was an all-round good fun movie. It'll keep you guessing up to the last, it'll keep you laughing and amused as it all unravels, and there's plenty more to mine in multiple viewings. I can't say it's the best of Rian Johnson's work, but it carries on his neverending streak of really good movies. I give Knives Out a solid 8/10."
1718,"First of all, I know this is weird to start out with but the musical score, composed by Nathan Johnson, was amazing and helped bring people into that old school murder mystery feel. The music sounded like it came straight out of an old mystery movie. The acting in this film was well done by everybody but three people really stood out to me. The first-person being Chris Evans, who plays Ransom Drysdale. He's mainly known for playing Captain America and this role showed people another side to him that I really hope we get to see more of because he played this character to perfection and I just have to say this because Marvel geek but somebody needed to tell him to watch his language. The second person is Daniel Craig who has a weird accent in this movie that needs time getting used to but it doesn't take away from this marvelous performance. One thing that I love about mystery movies is the detective's process of figuring out the case and he delivered on just that. The last stand out is Ana de Armas, who plays Marta Cabrera. This movie could have easily lost me but she was one of the main reasons I kept interested in this movie because she brings so much to this role that it captivates you and want to try and help her out. Now, I will say this if you can easily pick up on things then this might not be the movie for you because after the big reveal happens you realize all of the clues that you should have picked up on and face palming, personal experience. In the end, Knives Out is a great movie for everybody and I do recommend seeing it. But, like I said if you can easily pick up on things, which I usually can but due to the annoying person next to me I couldn't, then you might not enjoy it as much."
1719,"SEE ABOVE - Amazing movie, give her credit.If you have read an Agatha Christie book, post a review.I read After the Funeral a few months back, hard sledding to say the least. But immediately recognized this PG-13 remake. Ms. Christie knee how to make heads roll.My rating is 9, more like an 8.5 because no move in IMDB cracks 9.0 for the long run. Just enough to say it's above an 8.0; no fractions available here folks."
1720,"The best movies of all time are only 8.5, that means 85% of people really enjoyed thoroughly.People are complaining it's only a 7.9, but comparatively that amazing. I rated it a 9 to pull its rating up!For me this was a 10/10, excellent movie and especially fitting that I read 'After the Funeral' by Agatha Christie just a few months prior to seeing Knives Out.But understanding an old bachelor adage, is important: THERE IS NO PERFECT 10.If this review makes one person go read Agatha Christie it was worth my time.P.S. After the Funeral was also published as 'Funerals Can Be Fatal'. AND... there's a lot more murder in the book ;)"
1721,"Wow! I just got out of the theater and I can honestly say this movie was absolutely perfect, there was humor that wasn't forced, pauses that weren't rushed, all connected with brilliant sound design. This is an absolute gem and I 100% think that is deserves a lot more praise than I have been seeing in reviews.I want to start by giving props to the editor, this movie really allowed for pauses to build tension and create a very slow burning rhythm that compliments the story pushing both the stylistic and narrative components to further heights. However this is also a direct result of the preparation and execution of Rian Johnson and Steve Yedlin when it came to the production process. They use delayed whip pans to really give a very unique whimsical feeling when watching the film, this along with slow zooms and low angle shots advance the audiences perception of the cinematic world. Also I would like to add that this film has more ways of filming someone walking down a hallway than I thought possible. I think that it is important to also bring up the actors performances, I have to admit that after watching the trailers I dreaded seeing Chris Evans in his role as a deviant troublemaker because they cut out the most out of context lines creating a very cringe trailer but after seeing the film this couldn't be farther from the truth. He really broke out of his Captain America phase bringing a very noticeable stage presence, but Ana de Armas stole the show. She proved that she is not just a supporting actress giving a both developed and mature performance. It didn't hurt staring alongside the established actor Daniel Craig.With all that being said I am rating this film a 9/10 because the final product is a fun experience that has something for everyone."
1722,"If you are a fan of the Agatha Christie-style whodunit set in a country manor or the old board game Clue, you should see this movie, which is a tribute to them. The murder victim is a best-selling crime novelist Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) who seems to have committed suicide the night after his 85th birthday party at his Massachusetts estate. The suspects are his dysfunctional family (Toni Collette, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans, Don Johnson, Jaeden Martell, Katharine Langford, Michael Shannon), Fran, his housekeeper (Edi Patterson), and Marta, his nurse (Ana de Armas). Marta has a very peculiar personality trait that causes her to puke whenever she lies. A consulting detective named Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig speaking in a Southern accent based on historian Shelby Foote) is brought in to assist the police detectives (LeKeith Stanfield, Noah Segan). There are several Sherlock Holmes references. Craig and Evans are quite good, breaking out of their James Bond and Captain America roles, respectively, and the movie itself is very entertaining with some social satire thrown in. It is nominated for the Oscar in the Original Screenplay category."
1723,Daniel Craig is a great actor who needs to stop doing Southern accents. Everything else about this movie was fantastic. Just get over the accent quickly so you can enjoy an otherwise perfect movie.
1724,"I really wanted to like this movie, so when I went to see it I was so excited. If I'm being honest at first I was a little disappointed because much of the plot was predictable or shown in the trailer. BUT THE END- a very subtle plot twist-very effective. Absolutely recommended- great movie!"
1725,"Knives Out is a new murder mystery where someone amongst the group of family and friends is a killer and join the journey to piece the puzzle.When the father of the lush and rich family is found dead, a detective is hired to help solve the mystery and question the family to try discover if this was a murder or suicide.This movie is probably one of my faves of the year. There's so much humour, twists and guessing.
The only reason I'm rating it 8 instead of a 10 is because I felt it was a little too long and could've been a bit shorter, and I wasn't a huge fan of Daniel Craig's accent."
1726,"Although I've enjoyed (and loved) some of Rian Johnson's filmography, I was worried when the first 30-40 minutes of KNIVES OUT didn't grab my attention. I suspect that was purposeful, however, as an emotional gun-punch was introduced, along with layers of wit and intrigue, that built to an immensely satisfying (and truly unexpected) finale!I was treated to an amazing theater experience that went above-and-beyond my expectations for the genre, especially with Ana De Armas' character and performance."
1727,"With an amazing ensemble cast, a unique and entertaining script, and some brilliant direction, Knives Out proves to not only be this years greatest Mystery/Thriller combo, but also one of the best films of the year period. To begin with the large cast of actors in the film, the biggest standouts include the obviously fantastic performance from Daniel Craig as Detective Blank, Chris Evans as Ransom, Christopher Plummer as Harlan, and the surprisingly show stealing Ana de Arma as Marta- Harlan's nurse. The film decides to stay away from the traditional sense and plot lines of murder mystery stories, and goes for an unexpected route that proves to as equally interesting as it is incredibly entertaining. Rian Johnson shines yet again, returning to his original filmwork brighter and better than before, and not letting the hate of Last Jedi (even though personally I didn't mind it too much), affect him and his work in any sort of way. The film is masterly crafted and is filled so many twists and turns that you truly won't know what's coming next. Making for one of the most original and smart films of the year, Knives Out is not only a bloody good time, but a clever, compelling, and well made one as well; proving yet again there is plenty of new stories still worth telling.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
1728,"Some people just don't know what a good movie is, either they just try to do 1/10 to get attention or they simply just don't know what a good movie is and to that I have to say rewatch and learn it morons"
1729,"A loving nod to ""Clue"" here, a memory of ""Murder by Death"" there and stir together with some ""Death on the Nile"" and ""And then there were None"" and you have the epitome of the murder mystery genre - and that's what ""Knives Out"" is. From the constantly autumnal surroundings, casting dark shadows through every twisted hallway of the house to the lineup of classic suspects this is literally a perfect murder mystery. And what does the genre almost always call for? A twist. And with this film you have a twist within a twist within a twist. Or a donut within a donut hole within a donut... that'll make sense when you see the film."
1730,I was confused if Marta gave money to the thrombeys or she kept cause she was drinking that coffee at the end but awsome movie
1731,"Highly entertaining, great twists & storyline, with an excellent cast. Loved it!!"
1732,Can not express how amazing the movie. A great plotline with truly funny humor. Been a while since I have been this impressed by a movie.
1733,"Ransom has inherited the captain's usual style, Chris' role is really good!"
1734,It's a cute way to pass 2 hours when your bored. Nothing special about it but enjoyable
1735,"SPOILERS...Saying anything about Knives Out risks being a spoiler, including saying that ""saying anything about Knives Out risks being a spoiler."" So don't read anything about it before your first viewing.Here I will say just a few words, focusing on one significant aspect of Knives Out which is an extraordinarily entertaining and clever film.What recent films can Knives Out be compared to? Coincidentally (and I think it is coincidentally but remarkably) it is Get Out. Get Out took horror film ideas and played them masterfully, but also made us uncomfortable by using them to look at ourselves. Get Out definitely changed how I saw the world, and I hope it changed how I behaved as well.Knives Out similarly draws attention to how we interact with those less well off than us. It begins in the home of a rich family, with a wealthy author who has really produced something of worth, and his no-good family who have coasted on his wealth but believe they are deserving of that wealth. There are two servants, forgettable people who float around in the background and are sometimes very patronisingly treated as ""friends"". The similarity between the treatment of these two, and the treatment of the boyfriend in Get Out is striking. You no doubt remember ""I would have voted for Obama a third time if I could"", In Knives Out you have ""I thought you should have come to the funeral, but I was outvoted"". This line is funny, but it is powerful too. It shows how even when the servants are treated as friends, they are ""servant friends"", they are dependent on us (we hope) and so we can interact with them when we want, we can throw them a few minor rewards (a joint, an offer of a stipend) and they will keep running back to us.I live in Europe now but have lived many years in the USA and this treatment of servants, meaning immigrants who are extremely dependent on us, is precisely as depicted in Knives Out. (Europeans do this too, but this is an American film). By no means is this anthropological precision the main source of interest for Knives Out, but it intrigued me how well Rian Johnson (really a genius) was able to capture this aspect of American life. And, as you will see, it is very important to the film. It can be appreciated for the first time without observing any of this, but it becomes much richer once you do.It is noteworthy that Sleuth, one predecessor of Knives Out that is perhaps its equal was also deeply concerned with class and entitlement.I think Knives Out is a masterpiece."
1736,Viewers who don't think this is a great movie do not understand what whodunit films should be. This ticks all the boxes and keeps you hooked until the very end. It's hilarious and deserves so much credit!!
1737,"A complex and well-written film that is entertaining from start to end. A true ensemble, as no one steals the show and they compliment each other perfectly. That is though where we find the weakest link of the film. The characters are not very dynamic and do feel like plot pushers more than individuals in this world. This aside, the pacing is spot on and the level of thrills Johnson is able to create when we believe the mystery is over is amazing. The humor is wonderful and very natural to the characters and the world we find ourselves in. Easily one of the best films of the year!"
1738,"Original. Inventive. Clever. Great writing. Great cast. You have to adjust to Daniel Craig's accent, but it just adds to how fantastic this movie is."
1739,"Knives Out has the perfect balance for a film in all components. The cinematography is beautiful, the plot and character development completely pull you into the experience, every single actor was the perfect choice for the film, and it has some really great comedic moments to keep you wanting more. I don't have a single complaint about the whole thing. I thought I knew what to expect going into it, but I am so happy that I was wrong with my initial expectations. This movie is a must see."
1740,It's distribution that first inspired me to see this movie there is only good actor. Then very quickly we are immersed in the plot and it keeps us in breath from beginning to end. beautiful film that touched my sensitivity
1741,"This would be a nice whodunit, Agatha Christie-like mystery film with Daniel Craig as a modern-day and Southern interpretation of Hercule Poirot with a few good jokes and good twists and turns.
But that would have gotten it a 7 or 8 rating from me.
What makes this movie one of the best of the year is the underlying message.The movie begins with self-agrandizing introductions of the family members. The rich family who like to think that they have ""built everything from the ground up"" are really a bunch of failed or delusional characters that live off the fame and fortune of the family partriarch.
Jaime Lee Curtis is the closest thing to self-made you get in the Thrombrey family, but later we learn she got a million dollar loan from her father (sound familiar?) to get her started. Then there are Joni and her lifestyle brand and Meg with her liberal arts studies, the first broke and the second studying something useless in real life. Both living off Harlan. Alex at least is honest about his life and entitlement and his dependency on his grandfather. However, it is ultimately revealed that he would do anything to not have to earn his own Lifelihood.The contrast to Marta, the Hispanic nurse could not be bigger, she is a kind, loyal, hard-working and compassionate person and the only real friend Harlan has at his birthday party.It is through her honesty (she even has to throw up when she lies) that Marta ultimately prevails over the dishonest family. In the course of the mystery she almost always acts morally sound and shows genuine emotion faced with all the crazy turns of the story.
The family pretend to have let her into their lives and several times call her ""family"" but none of the know which Latin American country she is actually from calling her everything from Brazilian to Uruguayan and revealing how empty their words are. Their actions after the will is revealed show even more starkly that they never saw her as part of the family. Even Meg and especially Joni, who seem to be less racist (at least in a discussion about the Trump administration) turn their backs on her as soon as their own inheritance is involved and their earlier professions of empathy with Marta are revealed to be superficial. Meg even uses the information she has on Martas mother to pressure her.Ultimately, when Captain America is arrested for the murders Marta was supposed to be accused of, when all the self-aggrandizing colapses into itself and the pure-hearted and now rich Marta looks down from the balcony on the brats that wanted to ""protect their ancestral right"" to the house and fortune, you really see the similarities to an ever.more isolationist America that looks to the past for greatness and violates its own values to protect the wealth the current generations didn't even accumulate. It is the best depiction of the current state of affaires I have seen that is also funny and entertaining. And that gets my 10 stars!"
1742,"Knives Out is an instant classic. I loved every single second of it. I love whodunnit movies and this is definitely one of the finest. All the twists work, its very twisty but genius
The casting is awesome. It has one of the best casts of the year. Everyone has their moments to shine and everyone steals the show. However that being said Daniel Craig, Chris Evans and Ana De Armas stole the showAfter Johnson's previous film which suffered from Marvel Humour Syndrome, I expected the same but thankfully it wasnt. This film has comedy and it works like an absolute charm. It's a somewhat smart film with a fresh take. Some of it was easy to guess but most times it was all a surprise.
As far as flaws go, the first act isnt as good as the brilliance of the second and third.
Overall it generally is a fantastic film. Highly enjoyable and done in a somewhat unique way and it's generally really smart"
1743,"The killer was pretty predictable (Ransom) but revealing his whole plan was even worse, because for me it felt too cliché. like totally, a classic murder mystery on the 2010's. it's not that bad, it's entertaining."
1744,"Thought this was going to be more of a Cluedo style farce and it wasn't. Enjoyed it, but not what I was expecting (or what the trailer presented it as) and for that, it's a little disappointing"
1745,"Since I excpected a ""whodunit"" I dispensed drinking beer during the film and stayed sober in order to understand all twists and plots.
Unfortunately the film couldn't make me laugh. The plot at the end was way to complicated for me to be entertaining.
Also there were some logic issues that made me frown: E.g. what kind of detective would let a possible suspect put an important proof in to the pocket without even a remark?"
1746,"Knives Out was a pretty smug and adolescent effort by Rian Johnson. Its penchant for cartoonish acting and obnoxiously out-of-place camera work that I could have sworn I've seen done better in other movies, I found the movie annoying more than entertaining.The biggest crime is the culprit of this ""whodunit"" was who I thought it was in the first place. The movie spends a large portion trying to be clever and cover up its tracks with a red herring plotline, but that wasn't enough to build up to any good surprise. What it boiled down to was: ""oh that's right, who I thought it was in the first place.""The movie tries to shoehorn in some political commentary but never really goes anywhere with it or makes any significant impact.The final 20 minutes felt rushed and sloppy, delegated to a flashback recap.If you're already spoiled by great mystery and suspense cinema, there's a chance you'll end up like me and not get the hype.If you're a casual moviegoer that doesn't really spend much time exploring cinema and you're easily impressed by that plastic Hollywood gloss, maybe you'll love this deceptively elaborate piece."
1747,"If I don't get this am I Star Wars fan, and does that make my opinion not matter? Because I don't get Star Wars either. I guess it was awesome in the 80's but the one I watch recently was as disjointed as this. And wtf accent is Daniel Craig absolutely failing at. Is he trying to be funny, over the top, or is he seriously acting a part? For me this is a mess, so obviously I must stick to Star Wars because I have no idea what I watched here. It wasn't funny, dramatic, or mysterious. By the end I didn't really care who, or if anyone killed him, I was just wishing someone would kill me.5 Stars, I love me some Ana, she is awesome in everything she's in. I hope they make a Blade Runner 3 and make he a real girl."
1748,"Review:
Although the cast is pretty amazing, I did find this film to be a pretty average ""whodunnit"", which is a shame because it started off pretty well. Once the main character, Marta (Ana de Armas) reveals the true story behind the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), I didn't really see the point of the film, and it seemed to go round and round in circles, which I found pretty annoying. It's obvious that there was more to the plot because of how early the ""suspense"" element goes straight out of the window, and I knew that Chris Evans (Ransom) would play a big part in the conspiracy because he is one of the biggest names in the cast. As for Daniel Craig (Benoit Blanc), he certainly wasn't in the same league as Sherlock Holmes or Poirot, especially with that weird Southern accent, but he produced a touch of genius towards the end, which saved the film. Like most Agatha Christie type movies, everyone is a suspect, and one of the fun and amusing aspects of this film is the interrogation of the suspects at the very beginning, but even that was short-lived. I did like the chemistry between Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas towards the end, and all of the family members in the house put in a great performance, which is why I was expecting more from the film. You do end up sticking with the plot because your expecting something amazing to happen, which it kind of does towards the end, but it's isn't memorable. It just seemed like an episode of Quincy with some fancy actors. Anyway, I personally think that it's only worth a one watch because once the plot is revealed, I cant see people rushing to see it again. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Rian Johnson, who also brought you Brick in 2005, The Brothers Bloom, Looper, 3 episodes of Breaking Bad and the Last Jedi. It's been announced that there will be a Knives Out 2, after the profit that this movie made, so with Daniel Craig not playing Bond anymore, I'm sure that he will step up to the plate to play Benoit Blanc once again. Although I found this film to be overrated, I still think that it's cleverly pieced together towards the end, but not that surprising. And what was it with the whole doughnut analogies? Anyway, I got the moral of the story, that good always outdoes the 7 sins, but I still thought it was slow and predictable in places.Budget: $40million
Worldwide Gross: $309millionGenre: Comedy, Crime, Drama, Mystery, Thriller
Cast: Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Christopher Plummer, LaKeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford and Frank Oz. 6/10"
1749,"Movie had great potential but Daniel Craig, Mr. James Bond with a HORRIBLE southern accent ruins it.... so badly......"
1750,"I watched this movie twice, the first time in theaters and wasn't expecting much but was blown away. It's another Agatha Christie-like modernized short story, and I don't care for much of her work but still thuroughly enjoyed it. The movie felt kinda long but I was still sitting on the edge of my seat for quite a bit of it. There are some parts that are predictable if you have a stronger sense of intuition, though it does not take the fun out of things. The second time I watched it with friends and I ended up explaining some of the minor twists in the plot to them because it's easy to miss details. This movie has wonderful color and cinematography that won't be forgotten with time. Each frame has been carefully thought out and is consistent in showing how much thought and effort the production team cared and worked for this film. It's something that will frequently be discussed and selected off the shelf or browsing menu for years to come."
1751,"Perfectly made old school bit of filmmaking. Great plot, fabulous cast, and just awesome. Old school, not different or novel, just great entertainment. Brilliant."
1752,"The standard cop... The fan boi... And the weirdo ""genius""?The notes are getting annoying.Finally someone asked.I'm freaked out by Daniel Craig's accent.I think I know who hired him and what this is all about.He noted the time with an Apple Watch.Maybe he switched the meds himself?Everyone is outvoted. There must be a lot of secret ballots.No ""how are you doing"" from mom?I was gonna say they are not gonna let a civilian hold evidence.Maybe he's responsibly saved his handouts for years?Maybe Harlin hires him to keep her safe.It's always the screwed they say ""you know what's right"".Research assistant huh?ProntoMail! That is secure private mail! Someone knew what they were doing with that one.Now I suspect 2 people are in on it... Maybe 3.Okay. The singing in the car scene is funny.I'm glad they finally used that eyesore prop."
1753,"This is easily one of the best mystery solving movies i have ever seen. Everything in this movie was done in such perfect way that i can't even describe in a right way. Story, characters, progress of the plot, it just all clicked with me. If you are a fan of mystery solving movies and stories this is a must watch."
1754,Intelligently built up plot and characters. the story will grip you till the last minute.
1755,"It's brilliant. The whole plot tends to break patterns and perceptions which makes it engaging besides it also makes you wonder about a lot of possibilities. This movie is exactly what I want to find in a crime and mystery movie. In other words, the whole movie was well thought and it leaves breadcrumbs that in the end, it all starts making sense. It's not forced at all. It all falls into place naturally. Great acting by the way."
1756,It was a great movie but it can be better. I liked the cast and the scripts. It was a mystery that gives the answer in the movie itself
1757,"This is an excellent whodunit movie. Superb acting looking at the talented cast, it's no surprise. It's slightly better than 2017's Murder on Orient Express truth be told. Nice twist toward the end as expected from these types of movie."
1758,"I saw the trailer and I was skeptical. Yet, this film far exceeded all my expectations and then some.With special homage to Clue & Murder on the Orient Express, Knives Out is a murder-mystery. Knives Out is a whodunit that's visually appealing, fresh, and fun.Every detail leaves audiences chasing breadcrumbs and guessing who is the perpetrator throughout. While it's common to assume who's responsible, we learn that every detail given is as important as the last. Audiences' suspicions will change continually throughout the film in an organic way.Though Rian Johnson created this masterpiece, more special appreciation to the absolute A+ cast in this film. In such a star-packed film, it's surprising that chaos no one actor claimed most of the screentime. Special shout-out to Daniel Craig's (fake but hilarious) southern drawl, Chris Evans' as the prodigal son, Jamie Lee Curtis as the tough-as-nails mogul, Jaeden Martell as the young alt-right jerk, and the rising stardom of Ana de Armas & Lakeith Stanfield and many more. Everyone in the cast seemed to have real fun and chemistry throughout the movie. And the audience shares in the absolute amusement of viewing this movie.4/5. Will keep you engaged the entire time. Rian Johnson really outdid himself."
1759,"Sorry!, I felt sorry for the character of Harlan until I discovered that the man was clearly feeble minded, why would he write Walt out of the will or his granddaughter Meg, the rest I could to a degree understand, that is unless he knew that his grandson through Walt and Walt's worthless wife who spoiled Walt's son and turned him into a whackjob would in turn get a good part of that money, but still giving thay amount of financial wealth to the daughter of an illegal alien, by the way would that not also make Marta an illegal alien.Stupid plot approved of by even more stupid people."
1760,"""Knives Out"" is a modern whodunit written and directed by Rian Johnson. ""Knives Out"" follows a family gathering gone wrong, when the death of a wealthy crime novelist, Harlan Thrombey, leads a world-famous private detective, Benoit Blanc to investigate.""Knives Out"" is a cleverly constructed movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. I really loved Rian Johnson's approach to storytelling in ""Knives Out"" - very captivating and creative. The twists in ""Knives Out"" were brilliantly delivered and perfectly executed. The characters in ""Knives Out"" each has their own distinct personality, which makes the movie even more fascinating.""Knives Out"" also feature an impressive ensemble of terrific actors and actresses - including Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette, Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell, and Christopher Plummer. Their performances were terrific. Special mentions to Daniel Craig (Benoit Blanc), Ana de Armas (Marta Cabrera), and Chris Evans (Hugh Ransom).Overall, ""Knives Out"" is a fun and enjoyable movie. If you are into murder mysteries, give ""Knives Out"" a watch. I highly recommend it."
1761,"The trailer looked intriguing, so I thought - let's go. But half a way through e I was already fast-forwarding some scenes.The script and plot twists were very unrealistic and amateur. The lines got cheaper and cheesier with every scene, ending up being reduced to some quasi-Disney dogmatic remarks such as ""you are a good person, that's why you won"". Need I say that the template PC homage was way too in your face.The characters. Craig was overacting so hard that it really made me wonder whether I am watching a Little Britain-esque whodunnit parody. The accent was no good either - the ""aarhhrs"" and ""eerhrs"" sounded as if he'd briskly rehearsed them over a lunchbreak. The rest of cast was pretty good, but then they were all pretty much playing themselves - a Hispanic female, a snug young professional, the senior female of the family. Very relatable and very generic roles.Now onto the last discrepancy that really sent the movie out of the window. The accents were British, the architecture was British, and yet, the cars (number plates, steering wheel) were European/American, US foreign policy was debated over dinner table. How much lousier could a production possibly be?!
k."
1762,"A detective novelist's last wish and detective PK story. All star lineup is not a vase at all. The audience is completely trapped in the trap of omniscient perspective, but is deceived by the arrangement of the plot. A suspenseful film without McGovern, let the audience directly empathize to the suspect, fight with the detective, the anti routine design makes the ending more surprising. Today's mainstream values are undoubtedly revealed, which can be called positive energy and politically correct detective genre!"
1763,"Really enjoyed this movie, it was light in contrast to most dark or heavy murder mystery film released recently. Great plot, good acting, must watch!"
1764,"Daniel Craig is good marketing! I went to see it, not expecting much... It was mind blo, Rian Johnson is an absolute mastermind!! It's slightly funny yet whilst watching it you'll doubt it's greatness. The plot keeps twisting, sides change, a bit of unlikely action too, but most importantly everything keeps under control. In Summary - Seriously Oscars?"
1765,"Kept you on edge of seat whole time though the movie, long movie but you dont even realize it until it's over bc keeps you guessing all the way through. Enough comedy to keep you interested but also keep movie serious through out.Spoiler alert the killer is ....................
Not gunna give it away watch and see. 😛😉"
1766,"My rules, not my roles
""MY HOUSE, MY ROLES, MY COFFEE""is very real and suitable"
1767,"There are enough clues and hints. At the end of the case for nearly an hour, you can get close to the truth vaguely. But the story is still going on. The case grabs your eyeball, you get up, you straighten your back, unconsciously move forward, and you are firmly grasped by the tension of the drama."
1768,"Wonderful plot, complex characters, black humorous writing style, reverse and reverse! Behind all this is the moral decay, or the distortion of human nature! PS: for the first time, I understand that doughnuts can contain so many meanings."
1769,"A very nice and captivating movie, with a lot of interesting moments. The screenplay is very well structered"
1770,"This movie can become a classic instantly! Not too political especially when everything else is political. The characters are great, a lot of them well known. It reminded me of those movies you left the theater from glad and not worried about how much you paid to see it!"
1771,"Loved it...had to watch it twice, that's how good it is."
1772,"When you are really really anxious to watch a movie, because you believe it is good, it can turn out to become quite sour. Especially when that movie does not even come close to what you wanted it to be. Now if you are a fan of crime movies and ""whodunnit"" stories, this will not just tickle your interest, this will give you joy.Now I know that others may work otherwise with expectations and how they deal with twists and other things. You can see a few things coming, some may even argue they know everything (something I personally can't imagine, because the guessing game is strong in this one - and yes don't compare this to the directors Star Wars entry) ... but the way this is edited, the way the story unfolds and not even to mention how great the acting is ... this is rated high and very deservedly so! Try to read as little as possible about the movie and the story and just go with the flow ... you will (most likely) not be dissapointed"
1773,Rarely has one movie so thoroughly indicted the dysfunction of an entire society as this one does of early 21st century America.
1774,"There's a reason why I don't fancy detective stories - they're all using the same old formula: pre-story, crime, search, resolution. Knives Out is no exception to this; although I have to admit that to have us shown who the real murderer is before the movie even hit the middle mark was a bit refreshing, as well as the further unraveling story after that. All-star cast has made it possible for me to enjoy every single minute of this whodunit except for maybe Daniel Craig who was trying a bit too hard at times to imitate the southern accent and his overall performance was in a way just another Hercule Poirot imitation but a fine one to say the least. In short Knives Out is a no time-waster for sure; it's almost exclusively a bottled movie shot within one location, with great soundtrack, solid characters, some witty dialogues, a bit too theatrical and hyperbolized narrative but entertaining and fun to watch nonetheless."
1775,"Especially from Plummer and Craig who give their best teh film goes slow and slow till the end which gives us the guilty person.A nice piece of work better watched it a rainy afternoon,to feel better the suspence."
1776,"My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our local library. We enjoyed it but I have a hard time sharing all the high praise for this movie. It is one where near the end lots and lots of exposition is required to explain what all happened and how the inspector figured things out. To me that is a flaw in the script and directing.The most curious character is Daniel Craig playing a deep south (think thick Georgia accent) detective Benoit Blanc. He is called in by the family after their very wealthy partiarc is found dead, seemingly of suicide. But there's a lot going on in this eccentric extended family and when the will is read all hell breaks loose.The movie is mostly entertaining but the first part, where the detective and local police interview each person, moves a bit slowly. The fine ensemble cast is the main reason to watch this, otherwise there really isn't anything other movies haven't already covered."
1777,"No fingerprint checking , walter smokes too much & finally it's good moovie..."
1778,"When a film has THIS much hype, I find that usually it falls short. With other movies that have had a lot of hype, I found that usually I liked them better if I saw them when they first come out versus waiting months and months for rental and countless reviews. I think most of the time unless a movie is a rare unicorn, like Parasite, there's no way it can live up to the expectations. But then again, I also saw Parasite towards the beginning of its release. We tend to really dissect a movie. This movie has a superb cast of Hollywood icons and a fun, whodunnit premise. It was decent but did not wow me! I wasn't overly impressed with the twists in the storyline. I think the story could have and should have been better for this big of a film. My favorites Toni Colette and Jamie Lee Curtis were completely underutilized in this movie. They are both standouts, horror movie queens and strong actors who lead films and franchises. Director Rian Johnson really should have used this to his advantage and given them more than small background parts. Also, why do we feel the need to set off fireworks and throw a parade when a movie is just decent. Isn't that the goal of all movies anyway? To be good and entertaining?! What happened to movies HAVING to be good to be made? Now, if a movie isn't terrible it's shouted from the rooftops as an Oscar shortlist favorite. With the Knives Out sequel, I hope they give the audience more to solve on their own and spoon feed us less of the plot. They can really make an amazing, smart movie!"

1780,"My wife just started some tomato seeds and watching them grow was more exciting than this snooze fest. It was a boring stream of dialogue that just droned on and on.
We could not even finish this. We cut our losses about half way through.
I enjoy a good mystery, But it has to keep you in suspense and it must MOVE ALONG. I like all of the actors and that is all I can say that's positive. The Characters, on the other hand, were not interesting, nor likable. If I were to try to finish this film I believe I would have lost the will to live.
This movie lacked suspense, timing, and interest. Now, I will stop here, I have to go watch those seedlings I mentioned earlier grow some more."
1781,"Knives out is advertised as a whodunit movie. In a way it sort of is but this is Rian Johnson, he loves subverting expectations. Seriously though, this movie really subverts a lot of expectations. It's better to go into this movie with little to no knowledge which is why it is difficult to review this without giving away too much.First off, this movie has an amazing cast with Daniel Craig pulling off an American accent as the private investigator. Chris Evans post Avengers work has him play a much more terrible character which is a huge contrast to Captain America. Christopher Plummer while a minor role gives a very lovable mystery novelist. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson and Toni Colette give a very convincing performance as egotistic rich snobs. Ana de Armas must be praised as well for being able to convincing give the audience a sort of POV character in this massive all star cast. I will also give props to Lakeith Stanfield, Katherine Langford, Jaeden Martell and Noah Segan as well as they did a great job as well. The story and the screenplay is just phenomenal with the witty and charming dialogue. Likewise, the twist are smart and really keep the audience on its toes.I do struggle to find negatives but I guess the one and only true blatant negative is the very obvious political message. ""Right white conservative"" are bad. The movie doesn't emphasise it a lot but there are scenes where is delves into these such as immigration and having the white rich characters talk quite negatively about it. Likewise emphasising how the children of Christopher Plummer's character have not earned anything of their own legitimately or have been given massive money to earn anything. It's a very simple and obvious message that anyone can see throughout the entire film. Additionally, maybe the misleading advertisement can be quite a deterrent to some viewers. As stated at the beginning, Rian Johnson completely flips the Whodunit genre on its head but the trailers and advertisement suggest it is just a typical whodunit story when it really isn't. To me this isn't exactly a negative but it could be seen as such to other viewers.In conclusion, this is a must watch to everyone. It is such an entertaining movie and is a great reminded of films from the old Hitchcock days. While the director's previous work, The Last Jedi, was divisive; This movie is amazing. Give it a watch!"
1782,"Film's direction was good. I mean the story was shown in such a different way. Daniel Craig was best. Overall, movie was good. Waiting for it's sequel."
1783,"A near perfect whodunit. Great acting, script and tight paced, this movie keeps you guessing. Highly recommended."
1784,"This film has humour, intelligence, charm, and of course a great mystery at the heart of it all. The first 45 minutes or so weren't amazing but after that everything clicks into place and the film really takes off. Like I said, the mystery is great, but also the characters are very interesting (if not always likeable) people; it's not for no reason I was never bored during this film. Daniel Craig's character in particular was great, if those rumours about Lionsgate starting a franchise centred on his character are true I will definitely be watching the sequels. All in all, a great film, and I highly recommend it."
1785,Usually I only explained my rating for bad movies. This will be an exception.What a totally amazing beautiful funny movie. The plot was amazing. Acting was excellent. The story tremendous. Sound and pictures terrific.You will be very glad you saw this.
1786,"Loved it. Story, acting, cast... Everything was spot on! Much much more deserving oscar than that Korean crap. Enjoyed every minure of it."
1787,"Brilliant narration and brilliant ending!Daniel Craig did a fantastic job being the detective. His accent was something he must have worked on for this movie, and it was refreshing. I thought it was funny that Marta would puke every time she lied. Intricate, yet not so intricate crime mystery. Very well done."
1788,"This is a new old immediate classic
The actors were all stars starring
Daniel Craig keeps amazing every role he sneaks out from his 007 duties as the best jb
I really hope he does this role for decades as a modern peroit
He is probably too big for tv series but he in this would be gigantic
Just a great experience"
1789,"Finally I saw a great movie. Very entertaining, very well acted, very well filmed, great script, fantistic actors.Keeps the attention until the very end.
Strongly suggested"
1790,"I dont know where to start praising this movie! The story (heartbreaking as much as it is entertaining), the characters, the camera, actors, aesthetics..everything on point and there to amuse and bemuse, make you think and engage, reminiscing all those beautiful stories by Agatha Christie.
Every single actor was brilliant in its role, to the last scene. Why this movie doesnt get more recognition is beyond me."
1791,"I loved this movie! I was laughing so much, but was also worried for some of the characters. I think it got the balance between comedy and drama just right! I did actually guess who did it at the beginning, but then the middle threw me off and I thought it definitely could not have been that character. I thought it was a very smart way of getting the audience to be thrown off the scent."
1792,"Knives Out is that movie which will entertain us even after watching the movie. This is a movie we cannot stop thinking about even days after watching it. And the movie is even better when you watch it again and again. I knew this was going to be a good movie and Rian Johnson provided more than what we expected. The stellar ensemble cast did a superb job. All do them were good but Daniel Craig, Ana De Armas (her best performance till date) and Chris Evans. The movie is made perfectly and I can't wait to watch the sequel if it's anything like this. Kenneth Branagh's Murder On The Orient Express was good but would've been great if it was made like this. I hope Death In The Nile is more like this."
1793,"I was expecting knives out to leave a bigger impression on me than it did but it still remains a really good film.the clear strengths are the writing and the acting. the Agatha Christie-esque plot is incredibly well though and planned by rian johnson and works perfectly judging by the unexpected outcome of the investigation.other than that, it's not a film that kept me on the edge of my seat or glued to the screen in any big way. I think that's because johnson's writing let's the viewer believe they know everything there is to know very early on and you onyl realise how much there was by the end.even if this does make the twist ending all the more surprising, it doesn't keep the viewer that motivated to get to the end in my experience."
1794,"It worked for Miss Marple, it's worked for Poirot, it worked for Columbo, it even worked for Jonathan Creek. So why break away from tradition? Well, it doesn't.Firstly, WHAT A CAST! So many fantastic faces and some new (to me) absolutelt making an impression that I loved. Daniel Craig was especially fantastic here. -Bond. KFC BondAnyways, story. It's... OK. If you're a fan of the ""Who done it"" genre of movie like me then you will be constantly trying to piece together the 'who, what, where, how, why, Bruce Campbell' of these films and you'll come up with many, MANY theories of your own.Side note: I actually guessed a good portion of it right. Anyways.
The actual answer and the end was... in all honesty, a hit of a let dow. It wasn't a twist. It wasn't a surprise. It was LITERALLY the most obvious answer that you will most likely devise ""well it can't be that because this is a mystery film, not a HEY LOOK AT THIS SUSPICIOUS OBVIOUS KILLER"" Film.
Gotta admit. It was antichlimactic at that point.Loved the experience up until that point but why sell a film as a mystery if you're going to go with the most obvious answer and even make the reasoning sort of pointless.Oh and why would a nurse not immediately think of a toxicology report until somebody blackmail's here with it?? That was a little annoying.(Psssst, he could have avoided the whole ""murder thing"" by just ""schmoozing"" up to Marta and not commit any crimes)So yeah, enjoyed it, but was utterly pointless at its most basic core.
Just put Bruce Campbell in more stuff people.Ps: it was Chris Evans."
1795,"I knew who killed before 30 minutes to the end. And was disappointed that I was correct.
it is good movie but it wants me to believe it is smart movie which it is not"
1796,"I wonder what Agatha Christie would have made of this, I'm very undecided myself. You've seen it before family gathering waiting to hear who the killer is, sqrobbling between themselves. Well this a 2 hour 10 minute version of that, I wasn't that bothered who did it really, as they were all pretty
obnoxious. As for the acting it wasn't spectacular, Daniel Craig doing an american accent thats a first, some decent actors on show, but no oscars here. There was a b movie very similar to this in 2018 called Fortune Defies Death, check it out see for yourself. Overall not bad but no classic."
1797,"The performances of the actors and actresses all in this movie were great. And the way the ""time line"" wasn't exactly how it seemed, with some people leaving moments out really helped your curiosity build. Then again there were some points in the movie were it was apparent what was going to happen due to easy foreshadowing and very apparent discrepancies in the families individual stories. I would have found it to me much more entertaining if there were only small differences in each story that were hard to pick up but would be very satisfying to know. It was also too apparent when they lied because it would show Daniel Craig looking at them as music played. I would be fine with that occasionally but not for every lie."
1798,"I love that a take on classic film, who done it novel is getting its chance again and successful. The ensemble was great and deserves its acclaim. Its not over the top silly very dumb comedy like most Hollywood puts out, but smart, engaging mystery comedy. I don't speak this highly of many movies so take a chance is worth it. A sequel is in the works and am looking forward to it!"
1799,"This movie is a whodunnit unlike anything I have ever seen. There are several twists and turns that I definetely didn't see coming, especially a few things there in the second act that instantly made this film one of a kind. My only gripe with it however is that I was dissapointed by the ending. If you've seen it you'll know what I'm talking about, but for now let's just say that something very unexpected happens that I would've been fine with if the film ended there, but then they undo that so that the film can have a funnier ending. All in all however, with speculative news about a sequel I absolutely enjoyed this movie more than enough to say that I am excited to see what Detective Benoit Blanc will get wrapped up in next. 8/10"
1800,"In »Knives Out«, the seemlingly clumsy private investigator Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hell-bent on illuminating the mysterious suicide of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), a famous crime novelist. Blanc teams up with Thrombey's shy nurse Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas). But of course, nothing is as it seems; the Thrombey family is as colorful as it is shady.Oh, I love these classy crime movies! You know how it works: An old patriarch dies and his whole family wants to inherit the fortune he leaves behind. And of course, you gotta have a creepy mansion with secret passageways as well as an eccentric private eye. Director Rian Johnson (»The Brothers Bloom«, »The Last Jedi«) follows the tried and true formula to a tee, his love for the genre is apparent. There are some ironic moments and references (»Clue«; »Murder, She Wrote«), but most of the time, Johnson plays it straight.The pacing is fast and entertaining, Benoit Blanc and Marta Cabrera are likeable main characters. Craig apparently had a lot of fun with his portrayal of the strangely clueless Blanc. You always wonder what's the deal with this guy. I personally would have loved to see some kind of backstory for him, but I guess the mystery surrounding him is fascinating as well. De Arma's nervous and kind-harted Marta is very endearing; when you watch this movie, you really want her to get out of this mess unscathed. And yeah, the fact that she has to puke whenever she lies is bloody brilliant.»Knives Out« works very well as an audience flick. The movie theatre was cram-full when I watched it and everyone had a great time figuring out the twists and turns. Of course this movie doesn't reinvent the wheel; a weakness with most of these stories is the fact that the plot tends to become a bit too convoluted at the end. This happens here, too. But regardless, »Knives Out« is a charismatic update to a familiar genre, political undertones and a dumb yet thrilling car chase included. I'm already looking forward to the announced sequel."
1801,"Awesome script and storyline. Amazing actors. A modern-day whodunnit ""Clue"" movie that transpires all around a chaotic white family, a southerner detective and an immigrant nurse. I'd say kudos to the writer/director for this great work. Will there be a sequel??"
1802,"This movie is so wonderfully crafted, the acting is fantastic from start to finish! The movie takes you in one direction for about 20 minutes then it comes to a fork in the road and it takes another route. For the rest of the movie they are setting you up for an ending that they then veer far right on and gives you a whole different ending that is so much more satisfying. This movie is a huge recommend and you will leave the movie feeling so entertained that you will want to see it again."
1803,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time! Great acting and great plot twist!
1804,"Now that's what smart storytelling is all about! A very good ""whodunit"" like Death on the Nile. Daniel Craig is wonderful as the modern day Sherlock Holmes or Hercules Poirot."
1805,"Fantastic acting, atmosphere and plot!
I enjoyed it so much from start to end!I don't want to give anything away but the script is so smartly written and so well displayed!I'm still very excited with this!"
1806,"Boasting a huge ensemble cast, more often than not, seems to be a recipe for disaster. All the buzz around this, raising expectations doesn't help either. There were a number of reasons for this to be a big studio swing and a whiff but they swung big and did they ever knock this out of the park.Knives Out is raw fun. Yes, the performances are great, perfectly fitting the over the top nature of the movie, with Evans really throwing some charisma around. Aside from that it's beautifully shot, well directed and the mystery actually makes sense and you believe the investigators are legitimately working things out rather than just knowing things because the plot demands it.The tone of this may be the biggest hang up some have with it. It's part legit whodunnit and part commentary on the genre. It ends up being to mysteries what Cabin in the Woods was to horror, a great example and indictment of the genre all in one If you have a hard time getting on that track, this one may miss at times. For me, the over the top moments were hilarious and it felt like that was intentional.Definitely a recommend, one of the best I've seen in theatre this year and one I can't wait to buy and watch again and again."
1807,"First of all, I've been an Agatha Christie fan since high school, so I absolutely love good 'whodunit' movies. This movie was very cleverly crafted and well-written from a plot and character standpoint, so for a mystery lover/fan, it was an extremely good movie. But the language was so bad throughout the movie, that it ruined the experience for me and the person who invited me -- they were disgusted. I am so disappointed that Rian Johnson would make the choice to degrade an excellent film by throwing in gratuitous word-vomit. It was completely unnecessary -- one or two words would have been sufficient, along with the theme and bloody image, to get a PG-13 rating. Because of that, I won't buy the dvd, nor will I recommend the movie to my friends. This movie would have been a '10' in my book, if the language didn't exist.Daniel Craig's accent seemed forced through most of the movie, so it took me awhile to adjust, but I did love his role.Lastly, I just want to say that Ana de Armas was a new face to me, and she was phenomenal in her role. Great actress -- I was extremely impressed. The fact that she is stunningly beautiful in a sweet, natural way, didn't hurt either."
1808,"Just simply a really good film, go see, you won't regret it!"
1809,This movie was pure fun. Something different than what's been coming out lately. Felt like a game of Clue. Most of the characters were played well. I was intrigued from beginning to end. The ending was great even though I kinda guessed it. it was possibly the best movie from 2019. Highly recommend if you're into murder mysteries.
1810,"What a ride! Knives Out is thriller featuring dramatic shots, dark humor, and fun music.I absolutely love thriller/crime movies so I was expecting quite a lot from this movie and boy it didn't disappoint. The star studded casts acting is wonderful and incredibly natural. There are plenty of family fighting scenes in the movie that subconsciously display how well the actors have fit into their rolls and emotions.The story is very much like an Agatha Christie classic with a little bit more humor and informality. The twist in the movie at the end and the many surprises throughout make this film not only fun but incredibly engaging. Another thing that's worth pointing out is that the movie's deeper color palette, music, and overall personas mimic some 80s movie trends, which is an interesting way to approach a very modern crime story filled with 21st century references.Overall this film was exciting, twisting, and surprisingly unpredictable.*At this point forward there will be plenty of spoilersHarlan's death really doesn't seem plausible if you think back on exactly what Marta said. After Marta thinks she poisoned Harlan with an absurd amount of morphine, she tells him that he will die in around 10 minutes and will feel symptoms almost automatically. Harlan doesn't seem to have felt anything in the about 5 minutes when he explained to Marta his master plan and gave her the encouragement to carry it out. That's strange right?Any sane person would probably question why they weren't feeling any symptoms and wait a little longer before acting rashly and committing suicide, Harlan most definitely didn't. On the other hand, it would make more sense if Harlan realized he wasn't overdosed, checked the drugs again with Marta, and concluded that somebody was trying to frame Marta or secretly murder him.Another thing I feel like the film didn't clear up very well was the blood on Marta's shoe. I can understand that the blood spurted out of Harlan and landed on Marta right before she was about to leave, but just one speck? I don't know about you but that definitely feels a little fishy to me; it makes me think that maybe Marta purposely placed some blood on her shoe to attract the Detective's attention and force herself into a suspect position so she can be closer to the action and the development of theories - more information means it's easier to defend herself.The last things I want to talk about is the mention of the game Go throughout the film. Go is all about strategy, defense, and misleads. It is mentioned that Marla is the superior Go player, evidently defeating Harlan more times than Ransom. I believe this symbolizes that even though Ransom was coming up with this master plan to get Harlan's will, at the end Marta was always going to beat him because of her displayed manipulative skills in Go.Oh and also I would like to say that I absolutely despise Benoit Blanc's southern accent, why didn't they go with a British accent, it would sound so much more professional!"
1811,Great cast and plot. Keeps you entertained and engrossed the whole time.
1812,"This' the finest movie of the genre.
Rian Johnson has written and directed beyond compare.Well acted out too (Craig pulls a southern accent flawlessly!).
Just be prepared to be amused and confused at the edge of your seats , that's all."
1813,"Very few whoddunits have me grinning ear to ear like this one did at multiple points. The perfect amounts of clever and absurd, with a charm all its own.I'm sure many wrote off this director after a monumental piece of crap like The Last Jedi, but this movie should do a lot to restore people's faith in this director who also made phenomenal movies like Looper and Brick."
1814,"Knives out is the perfect movie for those who love to watch a murder, mystery and thriller movie. Knives out is a movie that has many events that takes you here and there, takes you to the past and present, the movie breaks the boredom in a very simple, easy and clever way and that is of course thanks to the writers, directors and producers. The cast is absolutely amazing, i would not be surprised if Ana De Armas for example got nominated for an Oscar, she was amazing and she really really deserves it. Chris Evans was absolutely incredible he really impersonated a grimy and sleazy character and he convinced all of us how filthy his character was that i think many of us when we look at Chris Evans all we see is Captain America but after watching this movie we will see the filthy Ransom Drysdale. Really loved the music, the interior design and everything about the movie, really really loved the directing. First when you watch the movie you'll think that maybe his youngest son killed him or maybe his nurse (who is played by Ana De Armas) or maybe Ransom Drysdale (who is played by Chris Evans) but then when the scene where his nurse kills him by a mistake because she gave him the wrong medications comes on, we are all convinced and we think that thats it ,she killed him not anybody else. And that's why i loved the ending of the movie because i did not expect that coming (Ransom Drysdale is the one who made up this whole thing so he died (killed himself) all because of him). Knives out is for sure one of my favorite movies in 2019 and one of my favorite movies of all time, i really hope it gets nominated for many awards and specially the oscars and i wont be surprised if it does because it really deserves to be nominated for many awards. Great job to all the the cast and crew, the movie was so fun to watch."
1815,"Usually, these types of movies wouldn't get a high rating, so I knew this one had to be good. It wasn't good, it was great. I love mysteries along with horrors, and Knives Out didn't let me down. The plot was amazing, the cast was fantastic (especially Ana de Armas), and I can't imagine how long the writing took. Do you smell that? Smells like some Oscars."
1816,"To me the Rian Johnson was the person who made some disappoint aspects in last Star Wars movie. I've got no information about this movie.First thinking that appears on my mind was, is this movie gonna be good? It turns out yes. The plot was intriguing, also the cast indicated some pleasing performances.I always like classic hard boiled type mystery movie. The movie followed the classic cliche and used double structure to bring out the suspense. I totally loved it. Furthermore, Daniel Craig's main role 'Benoit Blanc' was the hell of the character."
1817,"Fun but not brilliant. I felt that the movie could have had more comedy moments, and therefore, it felt a little sluggish. I love the end, though. Good job, anyways."
1818,"The film kept on getting more interesting from scene to scene. The tension never dies, but the atmosphere was comedic at the same time. It was a strange combination that worked really well.
The film had one of the best casts of 2019. Everyone was at their best, especially Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas who stood out the most. The music was pretty standard for the ""who done it?"" type of film. The sound effects were astonishing and kept me on the edge. The director did a great job at portraying a story that wasn't told before. The cinematography was okey. Most importantly I loved the small hints the film gave us throughout the story and connected the bits by the end.
If you want to be entertained for more than 2 hours... YES, go and see it!"
1819,"It is much easier to see another Captain America with Chris Evans, but not to see James Bond with Daniel Craig! Craig is so bold to change his persona here. He is deep in his role, smart, sharp and funny. Craig combines Poirot and Holmes in one character.I supposed Evans and Craig, happen to be the famous actors for famous and favorite characters, yet should change their appearance, e.g hair style. This would help audience a lot to focus on the story.It is classic detective film in modern era. Superb!"
1820,A movie with a good plot o what do I love those movies. and this is just one movie with a really good plot and an outstanding cast. and the movie goes from this to that to throw you of your phat. the ending was amazing I didn't expect that. I kind of did know that you know who did it bus I kind of didn't what you know who to be it. but this the movie was amazing and watching worth is.
1821,"I really liked, can't say it is only because of the scenario, the casting is unbelievably good, I liked every God damn actor in this piece of art. The mystery isn't so spectacular as I thought, it looks entangled, but after the movie, I found it pretty easy.
But I think this movie is not about mystery in the general when I watched it, I didn't think about the whole case of murder, I listened to all the discussions and were mostly interested by them and acting, but it is my subjective opinion..."
1822,"Who can doubt Rian Johnson's sophisticated insight of politics? This whole mansion weaved on the pres-(id)-ent of American society, which is represented by hatred and hostility. And I can say it is an extreme thrill that Chris Evans laughs all of the stupid fools in this house."
1823,"Great performances, exquisite production/costume detail, OUTSTANDING writing. Truly a story to die for with a political message that packs a punch."
1824,"A fascinating dive into classicism and greed. The cast here is stacked with fantastic actors. The dialogue is intriguing and fun. The pace is fast and snappy. The narrative, the intrigue, and the twists keep you on your toes for the entire run-time. The editing and direction is slick and compelling. This movie has it all.Highly recommended."
1825,Amazing crime movie with a mixed taste of comedy it's like a novel get out from the book and became a movie with itself without dircetion & production.........Bravooo 👏👏👏
1826,"It seems I've become too old. Certainly reading the positive reviews is for me confusing. The film has a fantastic cast but not even they could make this totally improbably story line work. Daniel Craig is easy to enjoy and he always seems relaxed on screen but he did have difficulty with his accent. I'm not American so this could be unfair but Dick van Dyke's cockney does spring to mind.
Please understand, the acting was mostly excellent. It was just that the story was not sensible. Finally, it's only fair to say that one person shone above all the rest and that was Ana de Armas"
1827,"I went into the theater not sure what to expect. It looked interesting. I was thinking maybe something like Clue. It wasn't like Clue. But it was definitely something that keeps your interest, peaks it, and gets you guessing and when you think you have it you don't. You pay attention and you hear something and you're wondering if this is where it connects or where does it all connect... Fill your donut hole."
1828,"An entertaining murder mystery with a colorful cast and playful energy. The first half or so is particularly strong and layers on the plot twists at a satisfying clip. The film is at its strongest when the ensemble convenes and the characters are able to play off of one another. As the plot progresses though, there is increasingly less opportunity for this and the film narrows its focus to only a few characters for a significant portion of the run time. It loses some of its charm in the process and the double, triple, and quadruple plot reversals start to feel shallow when the humanity of the characters has taken a back seat. I also didn't care so much for the forced political commentary, not because it wasn't an interesting angle to take but rather the execution just felt a bit too obvious and preachy. An enjoyable and lighthearted film on the whole, but it didn't resonate far beyond that.Solid 3.5/5"
1829,"Knives Out is, as you have probably heard, the latest gem by Rian Johnson (Looper, Star Wars: The Last Jedi) and tells the story of a rich family mourning the lost of their father (or grand father or else) who now finds itself, all of the sudden, at the center of a big investigation led by Benoit Blanc, who doesn't even know who hired him, to resolve the possible crime of the patriarcal figure, Harlan Thrombey.This movie takes the whodunnit genre and turns it on itself completely, or formula-wise at least. It shifts the focus of it's plot and makes it a great guessing game, as any movie of this genre should be, but you find yourself, at the midway point, not guessing what you thought you would be. Johnson is misleading you where he wants to but not doing so in a mean-spirited way (to lose you completely if I must say) but in a way where it just gets you where you need to be in the end to fully enjoy the story in it's entirety. Also, I was anticipating the performance by Ana De Armas and, safe to say, she didn't disappoint, with her brilliant subtlety in the showing of her raw emotions, backed by a complete internal understanding of the character and her background. Every actor is on point and perfectly casted here but she was the standout for me.The world building and character development by Rian Johnson is amazing and it is, as always, so refreshing to give money to an original concept in Hollywood!!! The direction is also incredible, and even though I like to analyze movies on 2nd and subsequent viewings, the camera work was so astonishing here that I had to analyze it and gaze at it for most of the film. It makes you feel the tension when it needs to, the anxious confrontation with the truth (that a murder mystery brings) when it's necessary and the kindness when it's earned. The score is also mind-buzzing and perfectly fitted for this genre, so I do not know who you are Nathan Johnson but good job!!!In the end, the story is upbeat and modernizes/revolutionizes the genre, the characters are great and amazingly built, the direction is probably one of the best this year, the effects are entertaining and beyond and the score is remarkable, and I'm forgetting a lot too. I'm not a professionnal critic or anything, but this is clearly the best movie of the year for me!!! 10/10"
1830,"Ladies and gentleman, Rian Johnson has done it! He cracked the formula of Agatha Christie's novels! In fact, what he did is more true to the core of these novels than recent adaptations like The Orient Express.The whodunnit story, even with all its twists and turns, is quite logical. There's no impossible coincidence, impossibly-clever mastermind, incredible timing or other deus ex machina tropes.Daniel Craig is also superb. His pompous Benoit Blanc detective, with his peculiar accent and mannerisms is really a better Hercule Poirot than Kenneth Branagh's actual Porot in the Orient Express, which was a caricature.Above all, this appears to a film everyone involved really enjoyed making it.In this age of superheroes and explosions and mindless action, Knives Out stands out. I really wish there were more like it."
1831,"Breaths new life into the classic Who-dunnit we know and love. The audience is taken on a literal twist of a plot where the conventional order we experience mysteries is flipped inside out in a way that is both deeply original and yet still pays homage to the classics that inspire it. A story blended with both comedy and suspense in a well-balanced cocktail of fun. If you'd like you could go deeper and also find some political undertones - but those were happily lost on me and the story was fun enough to be left well alone from the upper-class commentary. Seems to rush its final act and some of the details don't fully make sense to me, but still left satisfied. 8.2 / 10"
1832,Very fun who done it film just like you would expect. Great cast and a lot of good twist. Some you can see coming others you don't.
1833,"Halfway through the movie, I thought the filmmakers had boxed themselves in and I was wondering how they would get out of it....it is a testament to them, the writers and the stellar cast that not only do they make it work, they make it work in style. If you think you know how the plot will unfold, trust me, you have no idea!"
1834,I dont know why there are some low reviews out there but I found the movie quite interesting and smartly made! Would watch it again and strongly recommend.
1835,"What a terrific written and directed movie! MUCH better that I though it was going to be. Seriously, I went to see it just because Daniel Craig was in it! What a pleasant surprise."
1836,It was a fun movie and worth watching but i Think with all The other movies i could have watched this was maybe worth it but go and have a time at The movies but you have to love a murder mysteri
1837,"Except for some unnecessary language, this was a masterpiece. Funny, thinker, well acted and well shot. We all enjoyed it."
1838,"Entertaining. Love the atmosphere, set, and characters.
Scathing takedown of the hypocrisy found amongst many wealthy, white liberals. I say that as someone whose swinging from fairly far to the left. Just a solid movie all around.
Full disclosure: sometimes I enjoy a little cheese with my movies."
1839,Not your typical murder mystery where everything is revealed at the end but it's revealed in the beginning of the movie.
1840,"I think the setting was great bringing in a little Agatha Christie as another reviewer wrote. I just like Jamie Lee Curtis but hearing Daniel Craig with a ""southern drawl"" was a show stopper and a tongue in cheek comedy element. After a first few minutes I thought of the old Columbo show but I want say why as it might give a slight plot revel. I had thought I had figured out the mystery only to run into a twist but I was a little right. Good fun to watch movie. Go see."
1841,"Here's my review of ' Knives out ' . So knives out is directed by Rian Johnson, the guy who directed the infamous Last Jedi , but the movie I know him from his ' Looper ' which is quite awesome and made me look forward to this movie as well . The story is about the death of a mystery writer followed by a real time cluedo game with his family. If you've read enough Agatha Christie and Harry Potter you're gonna put the pieces in a matter of seconds , for those of you didn't , you'll have fun . What I loved about it was how they revealed the mystery a few mins into the movie and yet spun a tight web around it . The movie stars an ensemble cast of Daniel craig , Chris Evans , Michael Shannon , Ana de Armas and many more , the huge cast wasn't a marketing stunt and every character had a purpose followed by proper screen time , they were like the pilot episode of a great sitcom, being likeable characters at first sight . The movie is also beautifully shot and masterfully edited and I bet it's getting nominated for an academy for any of those . I also liked how the movie was able to tonally shift seemlessly from one part murder mystery parody to one part black comedy to one part thriller , and Rian Johnson handles that like a pro . My only gripes with this movie was Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn like accent which turned out to be intentional and pointed out towards the end . So with great characters , edge of the seat edits , masterful shots , one liners which land and one literal cluedo game , Knives out is an instant classic and Rian Johnson's biggest apology letter for the last Jedi ."
1842,"Saw the trailer for this movie and though it would be funny, but after seeing it opening day it truly is a masterpiece, almost like a modern day clue and trying to piece together all the stories and motives."
1843,"This is one of the smartest film i have ever watched. It kept me on the edge of my seat and had me guessing at every clue. This is probably the most fun i had while watching a movie. The stellar cast is just the surface of this mysterious, fun, and mind-twisting masterpiece."
1844,"This movie is great for multiple reasons but I'll stick to my main two.Reason 1: every character is memorable. They all had something that made them ""them"" you feel me. Even the young kid who barely has any lines is funny. Chris Evans and Daniel Craig are stand out roles. Chris Evans finally gets to play an diff instead of the always righteous patriot and Daniel Craig is just the best detective I've seen in one of these movies. You have your guys like the poirot from the recent adaptation of ""the murder on the orient express"", those aren't fun detectives. They're shallow characters written in the early 1900 that haven't evolved with time. Daniel Craig in this movie however is a very funny, likeable but also smart detective.
These characters feel real. They're not some pawns in a game of cluedo they're actual personalities. There characters aren't based on their occupation but on how eccentric they're. It's not ""the cook"", ""the Maid"" and ""the doctor"" but its ""Marta"", ""ransom"" and ""Harlan"". (Harlan btw, great victim. He's such a nice guy and I hate it when shows and tv make the victim of crimes a bad guy because the audience wouldn't feel bad for that characters death. That's stupid, that would make a villain an anti hero. This movie makes him instantly likeable by showing his interaction with Marta)Reason 2: Good story. Knives out whodunnit aspect is perfectly executed. It keeps you guessing on who ""dunnit"" (get it) and every time you think you know you get thrown for a loop. While watching I came up with atleast 4 different theories just for them to turn out wrong at the end. It's so good"
1845,"""Knives Out"" is sharp, witty, terrific and tons of fun. Writer/director Rian Johnson has reinvented the genre and assembled the greatest ensemble cast in years.
.
In this murder-mystery film, a family hires a detective to investigate the mysterious death of their father at a family gathering.
.
From the opening frame you know that you're going to have a great time seeing ""Knives Out"". Rian Johnson's attention to detail is so evident here and works out perfectly. You can tell this writer/director has been wanting to make a movie like this one forever. Daniel Craig's performance is probably my favorite of his career; he's incredibly versatile. Ana de Armas absolutely nails it and honestly I think her performance is award worthy. The entire ensemble cast is put to good use which you don't see often in these cases. The twists and turns are so epic you will leave the room floored. Definitely one of my favourites of the year."
1846,"If you loved Murder on the orient express, then you'll love this even more. Great cast, brilliant cinematography and just when you think the case is closed and the movie is over, BANG! You're hit with a huge twist. An excellent crime investigation film that absolutely leaves you guessing all the way to the end. My reason for 9 stars? Daniel Craig's horrible attempt at what I think was a Southern American accent. But then again, I could be wrong; it was that bad."
1847,"Knives Out tells the story of a detective named Benoit Blanc(Daniel Craig), who investigates the death of Harlan Thrombey(Christopher Plummer), the patriarch of the Thrombey family.Knives Out is a mind-blowing film. Writer-director Rian Johnson has given us a very unique whodunit movie, that has elements of comedy & drama, apart from being a suspense thriller. When you think you know what's going to happen, something absolutely different happens. It is delightfully unpredictable. The performances are the highlight of the film. Daniel Craig is spectacular as Benoit Blanc. Craig nails the southern American accent. Chris Evans is outstanding as Ransom Drysdale. It is awesome to see Evans play a character that is in stark contrast to Captain America, the role he's known for worldwide. Ana de Armas is the star of the show as Marta Cabrera. Ana de Armas portrays a variety of emotions with aplomb & has a very long & bright career ahead of her. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as Linda Drysdale. Michael Shannon is amazing as Walt Thrombey. Don Johnson is awesome as Richard Drysdale. Toni Collette is brilliant as Joni Thrombey. LaKeith Stanfield is great as Lieutenant Elliott. Christopher Plummer is superb as Harlan Thrombey. Katherine Langford is impressive as Meg Thrombey. Jaeden Martell is effective as Jacob Thrombey. Riki Lindhome, Edi Patterson, Frank Oz, K Callan & Noah Segan are good as Donna Thrombey, Fran, Alan Stevens, Greatnana Wanetta & Trooper Wagner, respectively. Knives Out is a must watch. One of the best movies of the year. Go & have a whale of a time!"
1848,Great movie all around. Perfect cast to lead a mystery. Had me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
1849,"This film was incredible! I did not know what to expect considering Chris Evans as one of the stars and his main works in the past were superhero films. He absolutely nailed his role as did the rest of the cast. This film had my attention the entire time and I will most definitely be buying it on DVD once released! I for sure recommend this film for anyone who loves a good murder mystery!!When Blanc was revealing Ransom as the ""killer"" , my head was SPINNING. I had a tough time keeping up with the entire explanation. (It all made sense; it was just a TON to take in.) I knew there would be clues throughout the movie as to who did it, and I am disappointed in myself for not catching some of them. I was also conflicted the whole time about whether or not I wanted Marta to get caught or not.."
1850,"Great film. Really enjoyed this movie, it even kept my wife's interest through the whole movie."
1851,"This movie is pretty good. A solid 8/10 and probably one of the best in 2019.Knives Out (as minimal as possible) is about the death of a family patriarch and the investigation of his death. It's written and directed by Rian Johnson; he did Looper which was great and The Last Jedi which was not so great but anyways..This movie is pretty damn good. It's a classic who-done-it crime/detective story set in modern day 2019. It's directed beautifully and the cinematography is on point. And it's actually very funny, which I don't think the marketing really shows.The performances in this movie are fantastic, especially by Bond himself, Daniel Craig. He carries this movie and honestly his character is an absolute joy to watch. The rest of the cast is great as well, notable performances from Ana De Armas and Chris Evans.The narrative and writing is also very well done by Rian Johnson. It's nice to see him doing films of his own instead of big franchise movies.Some of the characters are kinda there just for comedic effect, but
I didn't mind it. It wasn't really a bad thing, didn't bother the narrative. My main 'issue' with the movie was that I was hoping the actual plot itself involved more of the characters directly, if you watch the movie you'll probably notice that. It's not really an issue just something I thought would've made the movie better.Other than that I don't really see an actual flaw in the movie. The opening sequence is just perfect, the sound design fits perfectly. It's funny when it needs to be and suspenseful when it neds to be. Knives Out hits all the checkpoints of a good solid movie.Definitely check this one out it's really good, really enjoyable and an absolute killer (no pun intended)."
1852,"""Knives Out"" is a whodunnit murder mystery movie that had both an entertaining and compelling plot. I was at the edge of my seat from start to finish. Although, I enjoyed the movie, I was not particularly fond of the ending where Ransom gets arrested and Marta keeps Harlan's inheritance. To put it plainly, I completely despised Marta. She was an evil, manipulative,annoying and just a horrible person in general. The ending showcased Marta standing on the terrace and sipping coffee and glancing at the Thrombey family. The family always treated Marta with respect and kindness and this is how she repays them. She does not have the decency to support the family like they supported her all those years. This is disgraceful. It abandons the whole notion of how family is the most important thing. I understand that Harlan wanted to give his inheritance to Marta, but he should have given something to his family. He knows them longer than Marta. Marta should have been arrested, even though she technically did not do anything. The humor inside the movie was at times contrived and not funny at all. For instance, the scene where Ransom tries to kill Marta with a knife wasn't funny at all. It made me hate the Marta character even more.The movie had numerous twists and turns that were unexpected and shocking. From the beginning to the end of the movie, my mind was blown. I did not expect the reveal that Ransom was the one who hired the private investigator. At times, the movie was quite convoluted and confusing for me. It took quite a few minutes till I figured out what was going on.""Knives Out"" could be an Oscar contender for Best Picture and Best Original Score. All the actors were amazing in their roles, especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans who portrayed the private investigator and spoiled son-in-law respectively. It was a joy to see Daniel Craig and Chris Evans fully embracing their characters."
1853,"I can see why this film has been really popular as its made for stupid people to easily workout the bad guy , even for dumb americans-sorry but most of you are, the clues are in your face. Why have i give it 10 then , Daniel craig gives an acting masterclass along with plummer they boss the film with all the cast acting well above par , the comedy is subtle and no cgi make it a joy. heard it compared to Agatha Christie , yes if she wrote a story after a stroke , way to dim for she. the writer of this has found a film gap which as been exploited to perfection ,definitely a must see and i will not get sick of this film in the future."
1854,"Wow! I loved that! Phenomenal though out, what an amazing cast, huuuge fan"
1855,"Just got back from the cinema seeing this.
I very much enjoyed it, when you thought you had it figured out they then change direction and cover it well! Acting was awesome, was hesitant with Craig's accent but he did a good job.
Not sure on the haters, the movie keeps you paying attention the entire time and would happily suggest go and see it."
1856,"If we cut out the occasionally not-so-subtle jokes and dialogue about politically meta talking points, Craig's parodical Foghorn Leghorn accent (I'm still unsure if it's intentionally bad or not, I think it is), and the puke gimmick, I'd give this a solid 9 if not 9.5. Accidental genius? Perhaps. But still, the end product somehow shines.I hated the Last Jedi, a film which made me question the sanity of its writer-director. I'm beginning to think that Rian had some inner passive-aggressivity with Jar Jar Abrams or someone else that loved Star Wars, and that he knew exactly what he was doing by ruining the continuity of Star Wars with Episode XIII, because this film is pretty darn good despite the flaws aforementioned. Dare I say, well worth watching.Still avoiding TROS like the plague, but Knives Out is actually not a misfire."
1857,Started of decent but then revealed the killer half way through? What was the point of that? Ruined it for me.
1858,"Fun movie, but needed a double plot twist at the end instead."
1859,...is a truly truly lousy script and it's a shame because the acting was good so I also have to move a lot of blame onto the director as well. Best you never pay to see this - it isn't worth it.
1860,"It started off on a good note, but the story quickly started to fall apart and the movie was slowly progressing into complete absurdity. The director had a great cast, an unique format and a solid basis for a storyline and ended up ruining the whole thing with his lazy and poor writing. The movie only passably amuses and leaves you disappointed if you had any expectations whatsoever."
1861,Totally unbelievable actions of a man given an overdose with 10 minutes of life left.
1862,"It was a lot of talking that wasted a lot of time, and I didn't care who did what, just spent the whole time waiting for it to get good. My favorite part was when it was over. Encyclopedia Brown has harder to solve mysteries, and they're kids books."
1863,I think what makes a good movie is the script. If the story is good then the movie will be as well. In this movie you're taken for a wild fun ride and it's obvious the writers knew what they were doing along with the cast who all did a great job. I remcomend this fun movie.
1864,"This movie contains a different group of actors and I am used to seeing together. It reminds me of murder mystery dinner that you would attend and play one of the actors. Entertaining, funny, quirky but not stupid. I don't remember any bad language, which is more enjoyable for me."
1865,"A long but fast paced movie. Plot twists and turns all along the way. Great dose of humour, thrill, and good music.
A fantastic mystery movie."
1866,"Self-Deprecation, Misdirection, and Reinvention
Review of Knives Out - June 15, 2020 - by Vince LondiniRian Johnson's murder mystery brings a modern sensibility and wit. Not afraid of self-deprecation, whether the house (""like a clue board""), the detective (""you're not much of a detective""), or the car chase (""that...was the dumbest car chase of all time""), Johnson mostly keeps it light with characters who are largely aware of their limitations.Johnson proves a master at misdirection. The evidence of which becomes clearer after you've seen it through.A number of famous names take fun turns here, including Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson. But the key casting decisions gambled on whether Daniel Craig and Chris Evans could escape the shadow of their genre-defining roles.Craig slips into the skin of an eccentric, self-effacing, shambling detective - Peter Falk would be proud - and pretty-much pulls it off. No license to kill, here.Evans' turn is a bit tougher. Without a contrived accent to work with, he still sounds like Steve Rogers even as Ransom Drysdale tells-off each of his relatives, one by one. In posture and demeanor he sells the spoiled scion. We are almost freed from the blinding glint off of Cap's vibranium shield. A scene establishing Ransom's scoundrel-ness might have helped. So, I find Evans less convincing - but entertaining nonetheless.As for the mystery? Suffice it to say you'll spend the whole movie second-guessing whether you can trust what you've seen. Then you'll find out the real rules at the end...and that's when you'll want to watch it again. 9/10."
1867,"I have introduced this to others, and rewatched it with them. So I have seen this film 3 times within a month. I enjoyed it more with each subsequent viewing. Instant classic!"
1868,"We recently watched Knives Out. And other than it being a little long, and 1 glaring plot hole, we found it to be very entertaining. We were able to figure the plot twist before the end. But that didn't damper the movie or the ending at all. We found it to be a great story line and wonderfully acted.The one plot hole that we couldn't get past was Marta thinking he had injected him with 100mg of morphine. In her mind, as a nurse, enough to kill him in 10 minutes. However had she actually injected him with morphine he would have felt the effects immediately. And as a nurse, Marta would surely understand this and would have realized it couldn't have been morphine."
1869,"If you like death on the Nile, murder on the orient express, death in paradise etc then watch this movie! I didn't really know what to expect but I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you can accept Daniel Craig's very strange accent for what it is then you'll (hopefully) enjoy this movie too!"
1870,"This is a really amusing movie beautifully done. All the people that's rating it with 1 to 5 are completely out of their minds just because they don't agree with the political positionaments that the movie clearly state for despite doing it using the same subtleties of real life. No one has to agree with a 10, but its a really good choice to have a classic mistery fun time."
1871,"Was surprisingly good! I'm not usually in to mystery movies, but this one was full of surprises! I would suggest it to anyone who likes a movie full of plot-twists"
1872,Great movie I highly recommend this to everyone and it have a lot of surprises.
1873,"I waited to watch this movie, as I honestly hated the director's last movie (The Last Jedi) I know it's a silly reason, but just being honest.
Now I finally had a few hours to spare, and felt in the mood for a drama movie, so decided to give it a shot.It was absolutely worth it. Great acting alll around, and especially Daniel Craig did an amazing job.¨The whole story managed to move forward making it interesting all through the movie, and I never had that feeling of knowing how it would end, and several things did surprise me, which is exactly what I was hoping for.Anyone who likes murder mystery stories, shouldn't miss this one, now matter what feeling you might have for the director.I don't often review movies, only when a movie truly is a surprise, as I hope the rating and review, will help others to see it, and not miss it, as I almost did.It's the kind of movie you absolutely should see, knowing as little as possiple, so I'm not saying anything about it, other than great performance, good music, stellar camera work, and absolutely worth watching."
1874,As someone addicted to movies and also a big fan of mistery this movie was so interesting to watch. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Everything said and done has it's own twist. They also gave us a lot of clues that i think i catched through the jorney. I enjoyed it so much that i want more!!!
1875,"Awesome ...Film . 👏👏👏👏🎉🎉
One if the best films released recently...worth watching..Bravo"
1876,"It's a long time without seeing detective movies like Agatha Christie's Poirot or something else. This is a good movie tells us a complete and attractive story. More importantly, it has a happy ending. Guilty people deserve punishment. And the words printed on the coffee cup leads me laugh: My House, My Rules, My Coffee."
1877,"""I spoke in the car about the hole at the center of this donut. And yes, what you and Harlan did that fateful night seems at first glance to fill that hole perfectly. A donut hole in the donut's hole. But we must look a little closer. And when we do, we see that the donut hole has a hole in its center - it is not a donut hole at all, but a smaller donut with its own hole, and our donut is not a hole at all.""This is a fun and entertaining murder mystery, with a little dash of political subtext. Don't go in expecting grand sociopolitical commentary (go in ignorant, like me, haha), and I think you'll enjoy how these little elements were added. First and foremost, the focus of the film is on the unraveling of a mystery, which director Rian Johnson does in a skillful way. The pace is great and it's a strong cast, even if the film doesn't really allow any of them to stand out too much. Personally I loved seeing Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Michael Shannon amidst all the many others (Daniel Craig and his southern accent notwithstanding). The house and its furnishings are gorgeous, and the dialogue is sharply drawn. Despite having lots of characters and motivations, it finds a balance between immersing us gradually enough where we can keep track of who's who, and keeping things lively.As for the subtext, it's easy to think that the children and grandchildren of this wealthy mystery author stand for all wealthy Americans born with silver spoons in their mouths, but it may go further than that: they may stand for all Americans who feel a sense of entitlement to their birthright, and who have been spoiled by the fortunate situation they were born into. In other words, don't think that it's necessarily just a critique of the 1%. Regardless, I loved the different forms this took in the characters, and how in the end, even the more liberal or cool ones were out for themselves. It was also nice that through Don Johnson's character, we hear the other side of the argument, e.g. make immigrants do it legally, even if it's one I disagree with, since the process for immigrating legally is also under such attack. Whoops, I've veered off-topic for a film review, haven't I? Or maybe this is right on topic. Anyway, see the film if you're in the mood for something fun, it's a good one."
1878,Such a good movie!!! 10/10 for sure. It was a genuinely good movie and I wish there were more out there like it!
1879,Gave it a 10 because I want you to watch it yes you lol. It's not a 10 obviously Its just fun and refreshing all round don't overthink it have a realist expectation or no expectation at all just enjoy it!
1880,"After the Star Wars Skywalker ""thing"" i didn't had the mood to watch in in cinema but finally i went for it. Fortunately. Best experience. All characters are perfect in their situation and role, the movie is not too long. If i may suggest you, just watch it..."
1881,This ensemble cast created a fun film. The plot was simple but the execution perfect. I very well done English parlor mystery. Almost like a fun play. The actors were charming together. Get passed Daniel Craig's faux accent and enjoy the ride.
1882,"""Knives Out"" is one of the best movies of 2019. Actually it's in my top 3! Daniel Craig is Great as well as Ana de Armas. The score by Nathan Johnson was outstanding as well. Cinematography top notch. Really no complaints. The standout is the writing by Arian Johnson though. I recommend it highly!"
1883,"The stage curtains open ...In the age of NCIS, Law & Order, CSI, and True Detective, we are treated to this fun and engaging throwback to the classic ""Whodunit"" with the film, ""Knives Out"". I have to admit, I had my share of trepidation going into this one. Because, lately, whenever we are given this kind of movie, it always has a distinct ""made-for-TV"" feel to it. Not the case here. This mystery has all the thrills and magic of a silver screen production. In short, it delivers!Featuring an all-star cast, ""Knives Out"" is the story of one very corrupt family who lust after the patriarch's considerable wealth and holdings. And when he is discovered dead one morning, the victim of an apparent suicide, everyone is suspect. Except for his ever vigilant and dutiful nurse, who happens to be the one person who carries the most revealing secret. It falls upon private detective, Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig), to uncover the dastardly crime at its core and set things right.This is more than just a throwback to a style of years gone by. Yes, it is shades of ""Murder, She Wrote"", and Agatha Christie's writings, but this is not an homage. It is a resurrection. We may be entering the next golden age of the ""Whodunit"" mystery. There are already plans of, not only a sequel, but a franchise of movies centered around Benoit Blanc. Now, the trick will be to keep the same intrigue and appeal that this movie has.I highly recommend ""Knives Out"". Even if you are of a generation that is focused on the inner workings of a crime special unit or an FBI profiler, complete with autopsies, ballistics and dna testing, you would enjoy the simplicity of this good old fashioned mystery caper. An instant favorite, and one I will be sure to watch again and again, this comes in at a very strong 9 stars out of 10."
1884,You go in thinking it's a whodunnit but it turns into something else and who doesn't love when something is orginal?
1885,"In general, when you see 1 star, no need to waste your time reading it because it's saying, ""I'm a moron."" As for the complaints about politics, it's all for laughs. Anybody taking it straight is a moron.Here we have a brilliant ensemble of Christopher Plummer, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon versus Daniel Craig. Anyone from deep South knows his drawl is not at all over-the top. He sounds exactly like guys I've known. Southern happens to be easy for Brits, so Craig gets to play with the Southern Poirot.Each of the family is a piece of work, and the interplay is hilarious to watch. My only demerits are for Jamie Lee's part. Her character it too delicious not to have been developed more. Also, the kid was like an update of Eddie Munster, who also deserved more than the bit part he was assigned. And the ending had a hilarious part and a gimmicky part.But none of these spoiled an overdue return to good old-fashioned movie-making for neglected adults. By old fashioned I mean, with great actors doing their stuff, interesting plot and a creaky old house. And NO CGI, no explicit sex, but lots of wit and farce to make up for it.By the way, after watching I remarked to my partner that the Johnson, Curtis, Shannon threesome would make a great franchise. Well, I've read talk of a sequel/series."
1886,"Loved the whole movie it was filled with much thrill that I had to pause to get things up but still makes up space for your mind to figure the whole thing out
It's like reading one good detective story but with greet acting involved plus the directing as well !"
1887,"I am very happy to watch this movie. GREAT MOVIE
You should try to see this movie"
1888,I expected a lot more from this well-reviewed and Oscar Nominated film. I found it not funny although it was billed as a comedy. The bright spot for me was Jamie Lee Curtis who was perfectly cast in her role. Toni Colette was also good but I found this tedious and boring. Just not for me.
1889,"The movie really successfully, in my opinion, flirts with the old way of making who-did-it crime movies in a modern setting. Characters are not deeply developed, but are skillfully portrayed and viewer has not much to ask himself about the personality of each one - but it's not so shallow not to leave out space for mystery. Craig really surprised me well with how he carried out this subtly comedic role.Really pleasurable experience for having a nice afternoon with the movie."
1890,"'Knives Out' is one of those frustrating films where almost everything works until it comes time to explain it's secrets. 'Knives Out' revels in creating a whodunnit that pays tribute to the iconography of the best films that have followed this formula in the past. Rian Johnson is a director that loves movies and that love is infectious. His cast is expertly constructed and completely buy into Johnson's uniquely quirky world.The star of the film is Johnson's screenplay that knows the formula of an Agatha Christie-esque thriller and plays against the conventions while still embracing the audience's love for them. 'Knives Out' has the expected gimmicky and colorful suspects who play off a very real grounded performance from Ana de Armas. The juxtaposition between the rich self centered Thrombey family and the working class Marta works as a commentary and yet Johnson is able to still have that levity while tackling pretty poignant themes and commentary. This isn't an easy thing for a screenwriter to do.The major problem I have with the movie is it's ending and who ends up being the ""killer"" who sets the story in motion. I just feel that despite all of Johnson's clever storytelling tricks that he chose the most predictable way to wrap up this story. The character is in my opinion is hinted too much at. I felt like he was clearly a red herring and yet no, Johnson just gives in. I won't spoil it because the fun of this movie is not knowing but it is a pretty big actor who is less than subtle here. It's a mix of pretty uninspired writing in an otherwise fantastic script and a big actor who just cant quite find how close to over the top he wants to be"
1891,"The rollercoaster that this film is keeps my eyes opened from start to finish. The combination of wit, sarcasm, and playful allegories in this comes in just the right amount, sufficient but not enough to overshadow the thrilling whodunnit the film is supposed to be. I had a great time laughing at Daniel Craig's accent and even better at the rich white liberals proving that they only uphold liberalism ideas when it fits their agenda and their self-entitlement. Not to mention Toni Collette's character is everything and you can't imagine how refreshing it is to see ChrisEdit: Evans acting so unlike Steve Rogers. Delightful treat.
Modern American Gothic Tale. Loved every twist and turn and really connected to it. On a personal level. Being cooked and then having a couple share the first names of your own grandparents is trippy af, especially when what they're saying actually describes your family. Everything great about Clue updates to this century. Vaping was not needed."
1892,"....Especially a really good one. Knives Out has all the hallmarks right from the outset. Police interviewing individuals in the huge country house, where a suspicious death took place. Said individuals all clearly needling one another and all with motives, plus one seemingly innocent bystander. This breaks with tradition pretty fast though, divulging the killer, the circumstance, the whole damn thing... or does it? It certainly leaves you thinking, where exactly is this going? Daniel Craig feels like the lynchpin, playing the gentlemanly PD with the southern accent (American, not British), but this ensemble cast really does pull its weight and it's this cast that helps with the slightly unconventional twists and turns that follow. Suspects thought innocent, repulsive heirs in shady manipulations, red herrings and theories played out onscreen, not quite to Tim Curry levels of genius, but still a lot of fun."
1893,The movie was fast rolar coaster ride. Every moment makes you keep guessing a murderer with a satisfactory end. Some of the clues helps your intuition to guess true killer but they are very subtle and brilliantly placed in the story.Definitely one of the finest mistery with a lighter tone and some intelligently funny moments.
1894,A good movie to watch. Keeps you on your feet thinking whats going to happen. All in all a good watch at home or in cinema.
1895,"The movie is great. Period. I'not here to praise this anymore... but that accent tho' killed me with distraction. It seemed like Bond was trying to impersonate McConaughey, awful."
1896,"I've had my doubts at first, but I take it all back! Love the film, its unpredictable, fun, intense, it even had humor into it. Its a Must Watch!"
1897,Loved the acting and plot. Very funny and entertaining film
1898,Incredible film. Very well executed. Perfect cast and filming location. Daniel Craig's performance was superb. Chris Evans was so funny as he always. It was great to see some old timers like Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson. The plot and twists were great. Reminds me of Agatha Christie's Hercules Poirot stories. Really really good movie.
1899,"I loved, loved, loved this movie. Who doesn't like a good whodunit, especially as original as this one, taking us the Colombo route by telling us who the culprit was before hand and follow Detective Blanc come to his conclusions. You can tell that the actors had fun too, and each and everyone's performance was excellent. I especially loved Toni Collette playing Gwyneth Paltrow's caricature. Overall a great film that I recommend to everyone."
1900,It is a great murder mystery. Liked the detective. Portrayed pretty astute
1901,"I was blown away by Knives Out. The movie grasps you at the beginning, builds and stretches tension to it's breaking point, and never lets go. I wasn't in board with the quasi political debate, but overall it was not pulling down the story. Lots of laughter sprinkled throughout the film. All actors were firing on all cylinders. What a great ensemble cast and a wonderful film. Great to watch with family, friends, a date etc. One of my favorite films of 2019"
1902,"Hardly ever rate a perfect movie, but this one is so different from anything else in the past decade. Throwback whodunit filmed almost entirely with discussion effects, makes a mockery of big budget CGI fest.Just great acting all the way around, and where other films have huge plot holes I only have one minor complaint. Why didn't Rian do this for Star Wars? Stop milking the merch with a new droid per show, and put more effort into telling good stories.Rant over. Go watch Knives Out if you only catch one movie from 2019."
1903,"""Knives Out"" is an American mostly English-language movie from 2019 that made it now in 2020 also here to Germany. The writer and director is Rian Johnson and I am a bit unsure about him honestly. His very first film ""Brick"" I was not big on at all, maybe because also the lead role seemed miscast, but some of his other career works I enjoy a lot and that includes of course also his television work on the marvellous Breaking Bad. But now he is safe on the big screen. Seems a very versatile guy anyway, not too long ago he directed a pretty nice music video for LCD Soundsystem. Anyway, for this film here that runs for slightly over 2 hours, so not a short watch at all, he received his very first Oscar nomination this morning and a huge success for him and after seeing the film now, it is not undeserving at all. The movie also achieved nice accolades at all kinds of other award shows, such as Golden Globe nominations for Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas. For Craig it was the first believe it or not and even if I like him there's no way I can say that Ana de Armas is not the film's brightest spot and I would have liked her to get an Oscar nomination as well. Oh well, maybe at some point in the future. As for the other cast members, you will find many big names here. They are all supporting and I guess it comes down to how much you like them when deciding who's your favorite because they all do not have the biggest impact on the story, but are nice to watch. I personally enjoyed Shannon the most, which is not a surprise because that is true for almost every film he is in. Really versatile actor. Don Johnson I found most forgettable perhaps, but this was also expected as I don't have much connection with him in other films and the revelation about his character being unfaithful also added very little for me, even if the way how his wife found out was kinda funny. Christopher Plummer can of course also always be relied on and it's so nice to see that even close to the age of 90, he is still dellivering quality portrayals that are pretty much flawless. Luckily, even if his character is killed right at the beginning of the film, the man gets a lot of screen time as we get closer to finding out what actually happened.So it is a crime story and Johnson took an interesting path here. He gave us the detailed solution who did it and what exactly happened already before half of the film is over. But this is also only half the truth as we find out at the end. I do not really want to go too much into detail about the ending and how everything unfolds because you should experience that yourself. I just felt somehow that they all did it maybe (they all planned it), but then it was just one bad guy, but he was really very bad as we see when he grabs that knife and unlucky for him, it was just an artificial knife this time, which really (also with the slow motion scene leading to it) was absolutely hilarious and I and almost everybody else in the theatre was laughing so hard. Brilliant reference at that point back to the film's beginning when we have Chris Plummer's character (I think it was him) say something about how knives are sometimes real and sometimes just imitations. Luckily, that one was an imitation because it would have been heartbreaking if the guy really could have killed de Armas' character. She is also pretty stunning no denying. But so is Katherine Langford. Anyway, let's not get carried away on looks now, or at least not human looks. That knife throne already made for a nice smile on my lips with how Craig sits in it and all the knives are pointing at him. Really nice and smart and creative inclusion of the murder/suicide weapon. As for the Armas, her character is really depicted in such an innocent manner in the sense of how she is really the ultimately good human being. That made her truly memorable with how things played out at the end. Still in-between, I cannot deny that I thought maybe actually she was not that nice and in fact an evil mastermind, like when she immediately said that it was Hemsworth's character who wanted her to drive and put the blame on him. But it was nothing. Still, clearly Johnson was toying with the idea that we in the audience could think she murdered the old man on purpose knowing she was the one who'd get it all. Very talented actress, she delivered her part too and also nailed her funnier moments, which admittedly also had a lot to do with the script like when she tells Shannon's character that it is perfect because she has the money to get great lawyers or of course in another epic moment when the film closes exactly the way it started, with a cup that has some pretty memorable words on it that will again have you in stitches.I mean it is not a perfect mvoie, but there really isn't too much wrong. Maybe I struggled with believing that Craig's character actually knew it all so quickly because of the blood spot and also the exact revelation came totally out of nowhere at the end and he must be a true mastermind that he figured it all out so effortlessly apparently. But as a huge Bond fan, I cannot really say anything negative at all about his character. Or about the actor. He made some great career choices in terms of which films he played in in recent years and knowing the upcoming is his last appearance as 007, I am not only genuinely curious about this one, but also about all other projects he will work on in the future. I think there may be some great things in store. Perhaps he can even collaborate with Johnson again and give us a sequel/prequel here that is about how he solved the tennis player case that is mentioned on one occasion in this movie by another character. By the way, the Black policeman was really forgettable here, the other White officer though brought in some nice comedy with how much he was in awe of the creative people around him, especially at the end when he shushes his colleague down. Have to mention the Cluedo quote as well. Okay, let me think what else can I say about this film. It is a pretty long one yes, but it was so interesting and entertaining that it really flew by. There is great attention to detail here on so many occasions. One excellent example is how the female protagonist was really good enough in her profession that she took the right medicine because she saw the difference in color, which really made me appreciate de Armas' character even more. Okay the story with the other woman blackmailing the killer I could have done without probably, but even these more mediocre scenes and moments only fade because everything else constructed around them is so awesome. They are still okay by general standards and even these include moments of true creativity, such as the reference about ""you"" not being ""Hugh"" and how only staff calls him that. So no matter which perspective you take, it is difficult to find any real reasons why this film should get a thumbs-down. The good in here is just so much more frequent and permanent than the weak, which is pretty much not existent anyway. Oh yeah, I really shall not forget about the super old lady there: She does not even need to say a word to make for comedic gold, be it early on when we find out nobody knows how old she really is (from Collette) or later on when she sits there right in front of the window and sees de Armas' character (also pay attention how nobody can remember which country she is from originally and how they wanted her to be at the funeral, but more people were against it) or when she sits with Craig's character later on. Okay maybe she would have been more interesting if she actually did not know what was going on around her instead of telling Craig's character and the explanation about what she said in detail and that it explained how Hemsworth's character returned before that already also did not really convince me, but I am glad she was included nonetheless. This was maybe my favorite comedy film from 2019, despite the serious undertone and crime(s) happening, because I kinda struggle with seeing Tarantino's new film as a comedy, even if that one was as good as this one here, or maybe even slightly inferior. Okay, that is all then. Of course I give ""Knives Out"" a (very) positive recommendation and it is for sure among the most astounding cinematic achievements from the last 52 weeks. Highly recommended and please please make another movie about Benoit Blanc."
1904,"""Knives Out"" is an old fashioned movie-movie. The plot runs like a good watch. Big name stars play over-the-top characters. The set is a weird and creepy mansion. There are surprises and suspense right up to the final scene. If you want to have some fun at the movies, go see ""Knives Out.""A rich mystery writer (Christopher Plummer) is found dead. A masterful detective (Daniel Craig) is called in to investigate. An all-star cast makes up the suspects. You get to watch James Bond and Captain America face off. The resolution is not what I expected and not anything I've seen before. And that's really all you need to know. I went into the movie knowing almost nothing except that friends really enjoyed the movie. You will, too."
1905,"Murder mystery novels are still a thing, thankfully, but whodunit movies are not as common and when one has a cast such as 'Knives Out', what a joy it is for movie enthusiasts. The iconic Agatha Christie would have smiled in approval, I think, at this work from Rian Johnson. Johnson is not a newbie at this and it took 'Knives Out' for me to notice. He wrote three episodes of the award winning series 'Breaking Bad', in case you didn't know, and his directorial work here was on the mark.The victim Harlan Thrombey, played by the master actor Christopher Plummer, pops up all through the movie as we observe the customary flashbacks of the clues we are teased with. As with all 'whodunit' works, there are many characters for you to speculate did the deed of killing Harlan. Wait, was Harlan even murdered? Ah! Yes, this whodunit, as many murder mysteries tend to incorporate, has the added mystery factor 'Is it or is it not a murder'? I won't say more in case you haven't seen the movie.There is a full cast of characters, played by many actors we are most familiar with, an added positive for me, and these characters all seem to have possible motive for causing Harlan's demise. The movie walks you through the Thrombey family intricate relationships and the family business of course. It is a web artfully woven to keep you captivated from beginning to the end. The writer director clearly demonstrates his knowledge of movie making in the way he introduces Benoit Blanc to the viewing audience; Blanc, played by Daniel Craig was a pleasure to watch. His character's introduction was nothing short of brilliant and early into the movie the mood is set for you to start placing your bets on who done it!But you will lose your bet for sure, no matter what; it's a bet you won't mind losing. Any good mystery movie should not make it easy for the viewer to figure out the movie's climax. So, you won't, and that's why this is such a fun movie."
1906,"From the first second, Knives Out is FUN! The nods to Clue (also one of my favorite movies) were very appreciated. The characters are colorful and the plot is complex enough to keep you guessing how this is going to end. I actually went to see it in the theater twice, and enjoyed it even more the second time! The action and dialogue are fast and I missed a few quips the first time."
1907,"This is actually what we needed right now. We don't get movies like this anymore. If you have a chance, please see it!"
1908,"I have to say this..this movie is pure entertaintment. Daniel Craig as a detective..his acting was splendid.. Ana de Armas was great in this movie too. For me this movie had it all. The plot, the acting, the cast was 5 stars. its a very very well done movie. i dont have words to describe how brilliant this movie was but i will say that you will not be dissapointed to see this movie. 10/10. a must watch in 2020."
1909,"Such a fun and good movie with an exceptional cast. There are standout moments for all the actors but this is an ensemble cast.
The individual stories come out slowly, the gothic home has so much to see and I wish the camera would have stayed longer on some of the scenes. Each possible family member as a suspect is played so well - Don Johnson, Jamie lee Curtis, Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer - all are so good.
The twists and turns come quick - the piano note by the detective - a good mystery. Like a game of clue - with many suspects."
1910,"Knives Out is one of the most intelligent movies I've seen this year, with an incredible screenplay which treats the audience like they're clever. The movie has multiple twists and turns and the final twist made so much sense even though I didn't see it coming and makes me want to rewatch the movie again so I can pick up on the clues. Daniel Craig and Chris Evens deliver one of the best performances of their careers and the Thrombeys are all interesting characters, with lots of mystery and depth and Ana de Armas is fantastic in the leading role. Honestly, this movie is the most fun I've had at the cinema in a while and it's one of the best films of the year. If you haven't already, see it. It's a fantastic movie that keeps you guessing throughout, with satisfying and unpredictable answers."
1911,"Great crime drama, very entertaining, the one where you still will be surprised at the end. Good sense of humor and a little satire also helps. Best movie of the year!"
1912,"I didn't know what I was getting into with this movie. I've been on holiday with my family for a few days now, when my mother suggested the movie. The movie was truly outstanding and memorable. Filled with ups and downs, lefts rights, making you feel as though you're the detective in the story. This movie goes down as one of my top 3 movies of the year. 100 percent would recommend."
1913,"You don't see cinematography like this anymore. Great script, acting, lighting, plot twists and flow. No CGI, just a great movie."
1914,"My daughter & I were so excited to see this. The trailer reminded me of a game of clue and that's what it felt like. Who done it & why? I love the roles everyone played, but Chris Evans & Daniel Craig were the best things about the film. We loved how it all came together. Nothing disappointing, so well acted by all. We laughed a lot. It's a must see, you won't be disappointed."
1915,"Everything is over the top. The plot will twist at least 5 times before the end. Daniel Craig even has a thouthern accent to hide he was James bond. Acting is well perfomered by all actors.After 1,5 Hours is was a 7 then the BS started and became a 3."
1916,"I made an account on IMDB just to write a review and let you all know what a great movie this is. Without spoilers: this is one of the first movies ever where I couldn't figure out who did it, even though the evidence was all there. The plot is amazing, but it's the little things that make it actually fantastic. Watch what the actors do and what they say and you will understand what I mean."
1917,"A glorious film by Rian Johnson, best known as the writer and director of Star Wars Episode IIX- The Last Jedi. I enjoyed every millisecond of the film. The consistent main feature was the Kentucky drawling Daniel Craig, a chameleon of a thespian, if there ever is one these days. Written, directed, and produced by Rian Johnson, all of our expectations were subverted in this picture with a nice little twist at the end. What a ride. I would call it his best film so far, hope there are more to come like this from him and others."
1918,Another movie that i wasn't sure about...another clue based movie and all...but the story...wow...was blown away if you like a good mystery that will have you guessing throughout the whole movie watch this
1919,A very good entertainer! The director has kept us all guessing through the whole movie.
1920,"Saw a review that said this movie ""keeps you guessing till the end."" If you take the ""solution"" at face value, I'd suggest you are missing a lot, and many things remain unexplained.I want to avoid spoilers -- but I'd suggest there is much more to the conclusion than ""meets the viewer's eye."""
1921,"10/10 no doubt, everything else beside this"
1922,"The main protagonist, the South American nurse, who's nationality varies from country to country throughout the film, is a distraction from the gulty party, who is not actually guilty, ostensibly, of the murder, yet, would have been had the patriarch (Plummer), not done what he did. I can't say more without adding spoilers, but I have to say that is film is a prime example how tight editing and dialogue can engineer a film's success. The protagonist, Marta, is what some would call the McGuffin. Slick. The almost film noir detective (Craig) knows it from the beginning but hides behind an intentional Columbo-esque Cajun fog."
1923,"The most beautifully designed thriller of the year.The whole 2 hours, we were like:
Who did it? Then you thought of some little details earlier in the movie. Oh yeah that is it.. that explains it.. but how to continue the movie? Oh... wow here the next part. That's interesting. I think he/she did it because of this? Oh I don't think it is him/her cause xxx.
Wow. Great... yeah.. I knew it.. oh.. there you are.Oh no...Oh.. okay...."
1924,"Thriller movie fans may think that able to guess the story, but you must be unexpected with the method that used to twist a story.
Ps. Ana(Marta) so very cute."
1925,"Okay Knives Out was one of my most anticipated movies of December because of the following reasons1. The Cast for Knives Out is simply incredible because you have so many recognizable names
2. It's a Murder Mystery Whodunit
3. I love MysteriesWithout getting into spoilers, I'll just say that Knives Out is not just one of the best movies of 2019 but it may even be one of my favorite movies of the past decade because I came into it expecting a fun murder mystery whodunit comedy but what I wasn't expecting was the amount of social commentary that it has about the world we live and it has easily one of the best closing shots I've seen in a movie that just leaves you feeling absolutely breathless. It's also an incredibly funny and well written movie that I'll have to watch again because I'm certain there had to be lines I missed"
1926,"At first there were more than a few things that bugged me about this movie.Jamie Lee Curtis is OLD here. In real life she's only 61, but was this all makeup or has she really aged so horribly? It creeped me out.Toni Collette, whom I loved in 6th Sense and several other films, too, really stank up the screen with her performance. What a shock. Why was she so over the top and cringey in this role?And Daniel Craig's accent. I had a hard time getting used to it, but it did eventually grow on me. As things progressed, I came to enjoy him thoroughly as Benoit (Ben-Wa? Yikes.-----That threw me there. too, for a bit).This film starts out slow. And I mean S-L-O-W. I kept wondering why the IMDb score was so high. I was entirely convinced this was going to be some campy, 2nd rate murder mystery.Then, all of a sudden, things ramp up. Hold onto your hats. Full speed ahead. And WHAT A RIDE.I'm not going to tell you anything else except that this is a movie worth watching. It's pure surprise and excellence. If you like mysteries, you will love Knives Out. The ending is delicious. Absolutely delicious. I love it. Kudos to the writers.Oh: And ""Ransom"" (don't look up the cast----just be pleasantly surprised) is superb in his role, as always. Such a superstar."
1927,"I was curious about this movie because they have big great cast and the trailer looks convincing to see this flick, so I gave it a shot! Wow, what a movie! You'll keep guessing And your mind will wander from start until finish, great for moviegoers who likes mystery, go see it!"
1928,"Excellent film excellent casting
Chris evans and daniel craig do amazing jop
Unexpeted ending Iwould to see more film from this two actor in the future away from captin america and james bond"
1929,"Apparently all the low ratings are due to thinking one is supposed to take this movie seriously. Yes, it makes fun of the genre - that is intentional. And as for politics - every person in the cast of suspects is corrupt in some way.I had a tremendous time at this film and want to go see it again to catch the bits I missed.Still can't place Craig's accent. It was weird. But that might have been intentional too. One if the little jokes was his name - Benoit Blanc - white pope allusion, pontificating.I thought Chris Evans was excellent - played to perfection.Toni Collette, a favorite of mine, had the most fun.And it was great to see Don Johnson - perfectly cast as his naughty, charming self.Lots of gems in this one, if one has the eyes and ears to see em.And the house!!!!"
1930,"I love murder mystery genre and this was no exception. I'm with another user never go by the stars given. If it hovers in the 5* range after few thousand then it's a dog, but this movie was rated 6.8 after a few hundred and now look at it 8.1. Good popcorn movie."
1931,"Knives Out brings the Agatha Christie style whodunit murder mystery into the modern age in a way that both pays homage to the obvious inspiration as well as being its own original thing. Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is a successful crime novelist with an extended family with whom he has a variety of issues. When he dies private detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) is hired by an unknown person to solve the case of the apparent suicide. The plot thickens when it is revealed that Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas), Harlan's nurse and friend has received the entire inheritance in Harlan's will and is offered assistance by family misfit Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans). Without going into too much detail the film is well written, clever and fun, managing to bring new twists and developments to an often done genre. Most everyone in the star studded cast gives an impressive performance, especially Craig. I recommend seeing it while it's still in theaters."
1932,"Towards the end, after Marta and Ransom have had their lame car chase, Ransom gets arrested by the police, and Marta goes to the abandoned store front and finds the almost dead housekeeper. It is shown that Ransom has given the housekeeper a lethal dosage of Morphine, which at an earlier point is said to be deadly in 10 minutes. So, the housekeeper should definitely have been dead by the time Marta gets there, but she is still somehow alive? Can someone explain this to me? When did Ransom kill the housekeeper? How did the housekeeper manage to stay alive so long?"
1933,"Please Mr. Rian Johnson, abandon Star Wars and make independent movies, The Last Jedi was completely garbage so I didn't want to watch this movie but, changed my mind and gave an opportunity to this film. It's an amazing story and well constructed. So, please abandon Disney and make independent movies, I think it's better.
Also, this movie deserves better score, but the Star Wars fans are putting 1/10. Please fans, give this film an opportunity, I'm sure you will love it"
1934,"This was like a breath of fresh air! Like Clue meets Agatha Christie. Every actor played their part perfectly, & thoroughly entertaining."
1935,"After the underwhelming The Last Jedi, Johnson's latest film completely redeems him. This film was fantastic. All of the characters were realistic, great acting, plot was unpredictable and unique. Only flaw was Craig's accent, Tom Hanks would've been better in the role."
1936,"What can I say? It's just plain wacky! Daniel Craig as you've (probably) never seen him before. The trailer only hints at what is to come, and anyone who spoils the ending in these reviews is a knob. I've just come from a Cineworld unlimited screening and everybody was laughing out loud. Go see it, you won't regret it: a whodunit like no one's ever done it before, to quote the tagline!"
1937,"So there's Daniel Craig doing a southern accent. why do they think English & Aussie can do American dialects. except for Hugh Laurey doing a generic American accent. Why not hire an A merican, and if needed one who grew up in that dialect. getting past that, the 1st episode was painful. and I forced myself through expecting it can't be this bad. I gave up."
1938,I would like to thank wholeheartedly the director of this movie for creating this masterpiece. No nude/obscene scenes whatsoever. Pefect storytelling! Completely hooked from the beginning. This is the first movie after a long time that I can vouch for family members to watch it together without feeling awkward at any scenes. Can't wait for the sequel!
1939,I used to love to read murder mystery novels and Knives Out reminded me of that. I'm usually pretty good about guessing what's gonna happen but I was surprised at the end of the this. Daniel Craig is charming and charismatic
1940,"Entertaining, well cast, murder mystery, highly dysfunctional family drama (but in a funny way), really good dialogue, and playful references to murder mystery quotes. We stopped the movie just before the killer was to be unveiled as we wanted to ""solve"" the twists and turns of this ""who done it"". We've seen a lot of movies and have read a ton of books...and yet we missed! We were surprised. Now, that's not easy to do with us who are in their 70s. So how come Jamie Lee Curtis is not listed as starring or even as supporting?"
1941,I'd have given it a 9 or even 10 if I didn't binge Succession days before. I blame HBO.
1942,Personally I have never been into mystery movies or story's but I will have to say this movie was pretty great. Knives Out definitely lived up to the hype especially with the awesome cast that was in the movie. With a handful of big names in this movie any one would think this movie has to be good and in my opinion it was definitely awesome. I love Chris Evan as an actor and he kind of plays a part where you don't think he is involved as much but ultimately he plays a amazing character in the mystery. I would highly recommend this mystery movie to anyone that loves a good twist.
1943,Didn't think I was going to like it but watched anyway. Glad I did because it's one of the best movies I've seen in years! Daniel Craig was Great!!!
1944,"If you love cinema then watch this
Otherwise, stop watching, every shot, every performance is up to the mark.
hands down, have no more words for this one.
Very nice, when you think you figured it out you're still two steps behind."
1945,"Great watch, will eventually watch again, and can recommend.Finally! A mystery movie that I can even compare to Clue (go watch that too). This reminds me a lot of what the detective from ""Murder on the Orient Express"" is supposed to be.One of the things that really makes this stand out as a ""dinner theater"" piece, is that almost everyone is unredeemable. Instead of everyone is innocent until proven guilty, everyone is presented as a guilty (as a suspect, at least from an audience stand point), and we have to piece together the clues as we're drip-feed information.And as the movie continues, it reminds you where you might not have been paying attention, rehashes events in the logical manner that is required, in case you hadn't followed, to prove the case (again, baring semblance to ""Clue""), and every detail and every minute of the movie is intriguing.I'm looking forward to the 2nd watch to see if the re-watchability holds up."
1946,Rated 10 easy. This movie will keep you guessing whodunnit 😀
1947,From the cast to the story everything just worked well.
1948,"POSITIVES:1) The comedy of this film is amazing and almost every joke lands well
2) The reveal at the end of whodunnit is clever and the clues become evident on a 2nd watch
3) Daniel Craig's southern drawl is great and it's a shame that some people don't like it
4) All the actors bring their A game with some great performancesNEGATIVES:1) Sometimes I think that it's a shame that this film isn't a fully traditional whodunnit, the dynamic of Ana De Armas being ""revealed"" as the killer makes it non-traditional but it's still great so not a giant negative"
1949,"From the previews, I was expecting something very different. It was a good story, but it was not a movie about a family going after each other with knives out. The 'Knives Out' is a play on the back-stabbing family. I was very let down as I felt mislead.
Other than it being unlike what I expected, it was a good movie. Low toned comedy with drama and mystery. Great acting, can follow the story and keep the characters separate. I like the mystery aspect, including the father writing murder mysteries.
Just don't expect this movie to be what the broadcast previews implied."
1950,"How are people loving this? I mean good for the film makers! But Lordy. I knew in the first act there was no murder as I could see the writer wanted a BIG twist. So it had to be that the only innocent looking one was guilty but to reconcile that - either Harlon wasn't really dead or did indeed kill himself. And the D of P....hates us all to make us look up at Everyone in that awful angle in every shot, and in that lighting that even made Daniel craig look like asphalt.if you see it again - look at it, every shot the camera was low to the actors right. It's not pretty. The makeup artists must want to strangle him. I also knew the vials were switched when they made that silly ruse about playing earthquake and did the extra shot of the vials. No nurse is that stupid or enthralled to not read the vials (and later Daniel says it's actually because the was the best nurse - ugh). AND that clunky dialogue about ""they cant even tell a real knife""...I said to my husband that bit of useless data is coming back...and I also knew that game of throwns set piece was gong to play a big finish. Oh and that it was captain America who switched the vials by half way through as he's too big a star to take this job with so few lines in the first half. so as I saw it all roll out i had to just watch silly shenanigans for two hours listening to Daniels indeed KFC accent. Hate to tell ya but morphine in the vein (and why did he have a chemo portal for pain shots for a hurt shoulder?) at 30 times the dose - you are stoned in 4 seconds. And why did they think the tox report wouldn't point to the nurse and also if Harlon loved her so much and was still sharp, taking care of the entire families finances, and had given a 60 million dollar estate to the nurse and slit his throat to save her mother and sister from deportation, um, why hadn't he just hired an attorney to Make them legal for $4000 a while ago? I could do this all day...with the cop in the car she's gonna pick up her medical bag and then what, just put it in the trunk with Daniel sitting there?....and In the big finish I said to my husband when he grabbed the knife off the GOT chair - ""knife won't work"". I mean like Lordy people, how was this edge of the seat stuff? I did like looking at the gorgeous sets however!!!"
1951,"Rian Johnson, so dreamy <3Check this movie out for lots of Rian Johnson scenes!"
1952,"So , Rian Johnson can write and direct excellent movies that manage to subvert our expectations in a succesfull and meaningful way. Unfortunately , his great success here is completely contrary to the ""Last Jedi"" fiasco where he managed to destroy the entire new trilogy. What a pity!"
1953,"Must see!! If you enjoyed Clue the movie, then imagine it on steroids! Then you would have Knives Out! What a creative mystery flick... I'll say that Daniel Craig sets the tone in this from start to finish! 10 outta 10!!!"
1954,"It left me with many questions.SPOILERS AHEAD!Why Harlan seems to be the mastermind behind all of this (well, even behind faking his own death?
Why Ransom hired Benoit? It is obvious that the blood test can prove Marta guilties easily.
How did Benoit gets Mrs.Thormbey to talk?
Why Harlan told Ransom details of his will?
Why suddenly Benoit jumped into Marta while she's confesing?
Why Benoit does not seem to be a greate detective to me? Just nornalMany more. I very much love these mystery movies. The story telling, acting is good, but it does not satisfy me as a murder mystery movie. Should have some deeper layers, a mastermind, or a better plot twist."
1955,"Whodunit?Rian Johnson.Why?To subvert the tropes of yet another sub-genre... properly!As divisive as it was, I neither loved nor hated the love-it-or-hate-it The Last Jedi. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of the much-beloved saga. But I can give you a quick opinion of what I thought about it anyway. The first half almost turned me off completely: tons of lame jokes and out-of-character moments that indicate that Johnson's biggest concern was to subvert expectations and nothing but. The second half of the film was way better. It proved to me that Johnson is actually very capable of adding fresh blood to the saga, so effortlessly to such an extent that I wondered why he struggled so much in the first half.In Knives Out, Johnson didn't add a new spin on the 'whodunit' sub-genre of detective fiction; he took it and turned it on its head. He did so not only by playing with the tropes and mechanisms of this sub-genre -and boy, he did that so exquisitely and gracefully- but he also by using a new and very effective building block: Drama. It doesn't sound new, isn't it? But, actually, relying on it here, in this kind of a story, is nothing short of revolutionary, and that's simply lies in the fact it's unprecedented to build upon it here. The result is nothing but marvellous. And although that, at some point, the main concern of the plot wasn't the murder mystery per se, the mystery didn't lose its sharpness even a tiny bit. And that's a strong proof that everything worked, and integrated, seamlessly. I said integrated because the film has a plethora of comedic bits throughout its runtime -which flies by- and, to be honest, I think every single joke landed perfectly. The film also suggest a political agenda that's exquisitely woven into the plot, and provides a sharp social commentary that's impressively subtle.Not only did Rian Johnson reinvigorate this seemingly outmoded and unfruitful sub-genre, but he also did the same thing with a couple of members of the star-studded cast: I didn't know that Chris Evans, Captain America himself, would be better as, well, an ""Anti-Captain America ""; Craig as Blanc is absolutely phenomenal, with his southern accent and caricature detective character; and Jaeden Martell (IT) is very interesting as the weirdo Jacob Thrombey. As for Curtis, Langford, Plummer, Collette and Shannon, Johnson makes an excellent use of their incredible acting abilities, and of their facial expressions and features, especially Shannon with his remarkable menacing countenance. The real standout, though, is Ana de Armas. I mean, she was good in Blade Runner 2049, but here, as she plays my new favourite version of Pinocchio, she proves she's an exceptionally talented actress who is capable of expressing emotions, and changing them readily, only with her eyes. Honestly, I think she should have been nominated for an Oscar!Overall, I'm really surprised how much I loved this film. With Johnson superb and clever direction and meticulously-nuanced and witty -albeit slightly too-structured- screenplay, I think this is my favourite - even if it's not my highest-rated - film of 2019. You know what, this film is actually terrible: it's very pretentious; its puzzle is too convoluted for its own good; it has an overabundance of plot twists; it underutilized its stellar ensemble; and it has a lot of plot holes, or -in this case- donut holes! Excuse me, I gotta leave right now!(9.5/10)"
1956,Truly an incredible and fresh twist on a Classic Murder Mystery. I absolutely loved this film. Kept me questioning right to last sequence. Remarkable film!!
1957,"Rarely does such a great story be told. This film is a masterwork of layering, intrigue. Cleverly disguising itself as a run of the mill murder mystery. This one would make even Kubrick or Hitchcock raise their eyebrows in story and film making. To see it is one thing, but to truly watch it is something else. There's just too much to mention but any fan of the narratives in murder mystery and the craft of film making can truly admire this film with a tremendous amount of respect. Everything is carefully gathered into a beautiful telling of what is truly a masterwork in all facets of storytelling. I tip my hat to all involved and would highly recommend it's viewing to both young and old.Suffice to say, this is one of few films I could give ten stars. The acting, the cast, the sets, all of it. Perfect. I would wait a lifetime to see another film such as this."
1958,"You know that feeling you get when you're reading a detective novel and you're completely immersed it and can't get out even if you tried...?! Yup.. that's Knives Out . Rian Johnson pens down an amazingly well written screenplay featuring a standout performance from Daniel Craig and electrifying acts from Chris Evans and Ana de Armas breathing life into a genre that has been struggling to take off for quite some time. This Agatha Christie fashioned crime thriller will give the modern day David Fincher thrillers a toe to toe competition. It's weirdly, both an old-school whodunit and a surprisingly fresh take on a dying genre."
1959,"...and was pleased after the bashing he got from the vitriolic, entitled wing of the Star Wars ManBaby fanbase, that he bounced back with an original little indie, to much critical acclaim.It starts slow and not very engaging but it picks up immediately when the true central conceit of the film, and probably the reason why it's so vibrant and resonates with critics so much, comes to light. Ana de Armas has a key role, not shown in the trailers, and the film seems nestled half way between a retro Agatha Christie and a really really good modern TV series. It's nice to see a low-fi, subtle picture that allows its characters and dialogue and self knowledge if its genre to delight instead of effects and whizzbang.I have to say I bumped it down half a star (or maybe even a full star) because Haymarket's Odeon is horrendous, the screen tiny, dark and cloudy, the audio tinny and plonked all over the place. It's a shame that bad projection can tarnish an experience but it did. However I'm really really looking forward to watching it again at home and that counts for something in this one-and-done age of viewing films.The film is enjoyable and dark and funny and fresh. It's not astounding, but it plays very cleverly within its genre and with its audience but it never lambasts or lampoons them, it says something important about privilege and entitlement but doesn't cram it down your throat.Daniel Craig is excellent, clearly he's sick of playing damaged, dour, anti-role models and is acting up a storm and we're all loving it too. It's not a smug film, it's lovingly cheap feeling and tangible, and it's got some genuine standout callbacks and moments in it that will be remembered in film annals for a long time.A compliment in many ways to TV's Succession, a timely and exceedingly welcome joyride."
1960,"This is a well-made classical whodunnit, quite entertaining, and no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't predict all the twist plots. I'm sure detective story lovers will appreciate the unexpected turns of the plot.As for the plot, there is only one thing I can say: maintaining relationships in the family is never simple. Some families are idyllic, others have a black sheep. There is also the third type where sheep are of different colours, and none of them is white."
1961,"What a movie! No superheroes, no computer graphics, no violence, nothing broken except a trellis of a false window! Just about, say, 50ml of blood spilt. Nobody was out to destroy the worlds or universe and no one in capes with their underwear worn outside to save the planets. Lovely music. Lovely environs of a huge old house filled with scene stealing bric-a-bracs. Superb actors in an ensemble cast all of who were made to do exactly what the director wanted and they did it superbly. A whodunit movie from the good old times when they used to tell a good story that made sure that your finger never went near the pause button. An intoxicating combination of Christie and Hitchcock. A lovely heroine, without makeup or skilfully underdone one, who is a murder suspect. A rich old man found with his throat cut and many of his family members have the motive to do him in. A suicide by cutting one's own throat - a first for me in a crime movie. Suicde? Accident? Murder? The story moves as fast and smoothly as a Federer backhand. But it has as many twists as Nadal's topspin forehand, with a nasty bounce. Dialogues are sharp and to the point as in the old noirmovies.The charisma and screen presence of the ex 007 and Captain America himself are utilised to the full. The climax is gripping and not long drawn out. Everything picture perfect and I won't ask pardon for the pun. The only jarring note for me was the accent of the private detective Blanc. Perhaps it was done to ward off the evil eye, a dristi pottu as we say in Tamil. All in all a movie which will not
cause the critics to come with their Knives Out! The capo de tutti capi of directors, one M. Scorcese must have been delighted to watch this opus of Rian Johnson. The good news is that a sequel is planned for the future. Did we see the beginning of a franchise? Most welcome sez I."
1962,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen, since I'm a big fan of crimi and mistery movies. This movie had my attention from the first to the last minute and that happens rarely. Plot is amazing, acting, little humorous parts, everything! And the plot twist is just crazy! I'm speechless so long story short: Movie is not predictable and I think it's a must see!"
1963,I loved Ana de Armas as Marta and Daniel Graig as the detective.A very entertaining movie. I highly recommend!
1964,This was so entertaining which is exactly what I want from a movie. Reminded me of Agatha Christie's mysteries.Great acting and what a lineup of wonderful actors. Thoroughly enjoyable two hours.
1965,"I loved this movie! It was smart, funny and it never got boring. It's great because it's not to old for kids and adults will also love it. DEfinitely should win multiple oscars"
1966,"I got glued from start to finish! Daniel nailed the accent, Armas nailed the emotion, Nicolette nailed the shallowness, grandma nailed the aloofness, Captain America nailed the villainess... they all did a great job at their roles! Good directing, good acting and best of all, what a great story!! Obviously, two thumbs up!"
1967,All-star cast its more a a newer version of clue which I love it's a emotional roller coaster for the type of person I am but I would totally recommend it to anyone looking for a suspenseful all star cast
1968,This film is so good I want to watch it over and over again.
1969,Very good movie was entertaining and funny loved the story and keeps you guessing who the killer is
1970,"A smart and fun ""Who done it?"" mystery movie, which I watched twice!First of all, I was impressed by Daniel Craig's performance! His role was charming and fun and something like a modern, American version of detective Poirot (Agatha Christie). It's noteworthy, that I was not much of a fan of him before, 'cause I didn't like his first 3 James Bond movies. Yet, after this film I ask myself, whether the directors and screenwriters of those films are primarily responsible for this.Additionally, Chris Evans played a jerk - something totally different to Captain America - charmingly (!). Jamie Lee-Curtis and most of the other actors were great additions to the movie too. The one that unfortunately didn't impress me was de Armas. I could easily see another female actor playing that role better. Her performance started well, but was ultimately flat... thank God for her looks!Lastly, the writer/director R. Johnson earned back my attention. I was negative towards his films, because neither ""Looper"" nor ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" I found any good, yet, now I'll be checking out his future films with way less prejudice :)"
1971,"If you liked Murder on the Orient Express you'll love this. It's a better version. Great cast, great acting and riveting through out the whole film. I was never once bored. Recommend watching it 100%. Clue incarnate."
1972,I can understand why this movie is getting a low rating. it seems that many of the so called critics are out of touch with the public taste. the film is slow and boring in places and has too many unexplained sections. why does the old man want to kill himself and is it really possible to cut your own throat ? give me Marlowe any day
1973,Watched this film without knowing anything about it. Somehow avoided the spoilers. All the better for it because I thoroughly enjoyed it. Would recommend to all that enjoy a whodunit murder mystery comedy. Brilliant performances from all. Absolutely loved this film.
1974,"What a great movie!! It's edge-of-the-seat, mysterious, yet fun. The writers of the movie could have written an equally good bestseller book, had they tried. Pay attention to the details and you could even play whodunit with the screenplay. It's humorous and suspenseful at the same time.And Daniel Craig - W.O.W. Watching the actor do the role of an American detective just a few months before the release of the next Bond film was a wonderful treat. Just so amazing to see how well he has adapted to this role. Ana de Armas has earned a special mention for the character she plays. I don't want to give even a single line description of the movie's plot. Just go and watch it unfold. Overall a great entertainer. My take - A Must Watch!"
1975,"It is really that good, so entertaining and fun! Great ensemble cast and directing. So fun and funny and mysterious and all! MUST SEE"
1976,Great movie. Great plot. Murder on the Orient themed.
1977,"Knives Out is an exceptionally wonderful murder mystery that is the most entertaining movie I've seen all year. It is freshly original, and the casting is superb. This is a strong contender for my favourite film of the decade, and I strongly recommend it to any fan of Agatha Christie or the mystery genre in general."
1978,"A brilliantly fun film. Great cast, great sets and a cracking plot."
1979,"This represents the best in story telling. It would do the film an injustice to say anything else; well, other than: ""GO see it, in the classic, standard theater setting with all of the strappings of movie going.""
(No disrespect streamers; folk will be able to enjoy this for years to come in living rooms or on e-devices)
Ken Mask, Filmmaker"
1980,Captain america gone bad. And what' up with Bond' accent??
1981,The movie is excellent the story an the plot was so good and the twist was very good and the actress Specifically Ana and Daniel they were so perfect if i get the chance to see it again believe me i will
1982,Who-dunit-story with entertaining suspense in an original plot! Top level acting from really the whole cast. Must see!
1983,"A billionaire author(Christopher Plummer) suddenly dies from an apparent suicide, and all his relatives come in hopes to hearing a reading of the will. But soon a brilliant detective(Daniel Craig) starts to see there is more to his death then what meets the eye.Writer/Director Rian Johnson really delivers an Agatha Christie like mystery, that keeps an interest with it's all star cast, Don Johnson, Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon, and Chris Evans to name a few. My only real complaint is Daniel Craig, some scenes he's good, and other scenes he's annoyingly over the top, to the point I feel he was giving a parody like performance. But all in all still a good mystery, just when you think you know where it's headed and then it will really surprise you."
1984,"Granted this movie is finally 8.1/10 but it's too good of a movie that I couldn't not review it. Rian Johnson screwed the pooch on TLJ. True. But this is not that. This is brilliant. This is original. This is classic. Just when you think you have it solved, there's more. But not in a convoluted and stupid way. It's masterful. The ""whodunit"" is his forte. I only hope he has more of these up his sleeve."
1985,"We hadn't gone to the movies much lately, then we saw Midway, which we enjoyed, and then Ford v Ferrari which we enjoyed even more, and now Knives Out which we had heard was even better than the first two. They were right.It's a joy to be entertained by this ensemble from Daniel Craig, as Benoit Blanc, to Ana de Armas, as Marta, and everyone in between. They make those old Agatha Christie movies seem under-played and not very carefully cast, which is saying a lot. Without digging into this film's origins I very much doubt we'll ever see a sequel with a plot anywhere as good as this one. This movie is richly wrought and overwhelmingly satisfying and the only negative thing I have to say about it is just that, there's almost no chance of a worthy sequel."
1986,"Well crafted. Good plot and sane twists.Ana De Armas is amazing at her part and it was definitely nice seeing Evans playing the bad guy after all the avengers hype.Craig is very ""Poirot-y"" and not so much ""Holmes-y"" but his character works just fine."
1987,"If, at times, you draw a comparison of the movie to the movie ""Clue"", it would not be a surprise. Unlike Clue, this is true murder mystery.So often in movies like this you have a pretty good idea of how things will play out. That is not the case in this movie. Take mental notes throughout the movie. After you leave the cinema with a smile, having been truly entertained, take some time to pick the movie apart. I believe you will come up with a reason to see it a second time. I know I did! I am not going to say any more other than: See it. Take mental notes. Enjoy it. Pick it apart. See it again. Enjoy and appreciate it more the second time."
1988,"Excellent plot , excellent acting , a really good film , Daniel Craig really goid"
1989,"Just speechless , one of the best movies ever made
Hardly recommended"
1990,"One of my favourites from 2019Rian Johnson makes a Who-done-it? With a twist of his own, let the audience feel like that everybody is the murderer.Many people complain that they saw the twist coming but I would argue, even I saw the last twist coming and I was right, well I actually thought everybody for a brief moment was the murderer so whomever came through that door, I would have said 'I saw it coming'Some clever writing is obviously involved and I am excited about the sequel with our Southern Bond and I hope studio gives Rian more time to come up with these kind of stories.The ensemble cast is magnificent, the location is a beauty and political wars going in the background makes the family for realistic as they argue a lot a lot.
The Quips were well by some cast members.The charisma of the presence of Evans and his sweeter stole the show for many.
Ana de Armas gave a loveable performance as the protagonist.Some nitpicks will be 'Lie Vomit', that other caretakers plots of hospital receipt-going alone to get murdered felt surreal and too much at same time to digest.Overall must watch for the inevitable twist, might see another time to look at the more details. 'Prop-knife vs real knife'""A doughnut hole in the doughnut's hole'"
1991,Honestly I might have enjoyed this if I hadn't already predicted the entire plot in the 1st 20 minutes.
1992,"Very funny very entertaining Daniel Craig rules Chris Evens kills it, the beautiful Ana de Armas is at her absolute best and the rest of the supporting cast are great and hilarious. Great twist and I certainly hope Rian is serious about sequels."
1993,"What a Beautiful Film Well Written and well Directed By Rian Johnson, i just don't know why he's Wasting his time on the star Wars Franchise, he should just do these kind of original Work in My Opinion."
1994,MYMYMY what an simple movie with an EXCELLENT Direction and acting. Must watch.
1995,The plot is very well-designed: all evidence accounted for and all characters complete their arcs. Magnificent cast and a rare sense of humor among murder mysteries. Would love to see more work from this brilliant group.
1996,"Everything you could wish for in a whodunnit, or any genre for that matter. A great script at the centre of it. Excellent performances, humour, lavish sets, cracking cinematography and twists aplenty makes this a wonderful two hours of cinema."
1997,"I really enjoyed this movie, very good script and the acting at high level especially from Ana De Armas , this girl except from very beautiful is and very talented , very strong cast and story , Christoffer Plummer and Daniel Craig stand out , perfect for Christmas"
1998,One of the best movie i've watched. I watched it 2x. Overall 10/10.
1999,"I rarely find a film both so humorous and enthralling. The cast not only fill their respective roles superbly, but embody their characters in a manner that appears nothing less than natural. Daniel Craig's performance as Benoit Blanc is only bested by Ana de Armas' embodiment of Marta Cabrera. Any reservations one may have about the choice of director, Rian Johnson, must be set aside. This film will almost certainly redeem his credibility to any viewer frustrated with his work on The Last Jedi."""
2000,One of the best all round performance. Every cast is performing brilliantly. With terrific cast too
2001,"This movie is eye-candy, sassy, and filled with sarcastic irony. I swear I'll have to see it at least two more times to really get all the nuances. There's a star actor in each scene, surprises galore, beautiful and bizarre sets, all filled with quirkiness and gore sufficient to keep Tarantino affecianos happy. Hilarious and crazy. A must see for the holidays."
2002,"Starting with the title, a painful issue here in Israel. Since the title is determined by the distributers of the movie, not by the translators, we here end up repeatedly with travesties such as this. How does one make Knives Out, which is not a precise idiom in Hebrew, but does have a close enough meaning as is, into A Well Written Murder. I'm sorry, but the answer here is beyond me and I suspect there's none. I suppose I should be used to this problem with movies titles, but I never am.As for the movie itself. It's a good dark comedy, with a stellar cast that justifies its casting. They all perform superbly, most of all Chris Evans and Ana de Armas. But one must also mention Daniel Craig who gets to play a cartoon character, and still manages to come out OK. Every time he spoke, I kept remembering Tony Curtis in Some Like it Hot, when he lampooned Cary Grant, pretending to be a made up oil billioner and Jack Lemmon reacted ""Nobody speaks like that"". Nobody speaks the way Craig spoke in this movie, it was just one more aspect of making him a cartoon, a cardboard cut out for the excentric detectives the Agatha Christie school of detective literature loves so much. Unlike all other characters here, which are cartoons of real people, Craig is a cartoon of literary tradition implanted in the movie. Considering this, he does his job as well as could be expected.One last point - the political aspect. Yes, one can't understand it without the contemporary beckground, and I think it's a mistake, limiting the movie. But I can also see the point the movie's creators were trying to make - xenophobia and bigotry arn't limited to red necks and to the lower tiers of society. In fact they are much more insidious when practiced by the upper echelons of society. I can see this point, I may even agree with this opinion, but it didn't have to take such a significant role in the movie. Taking the detective literture and satirizing it, may call for barbs directed toward the aristocracy, it doesn't mean it has to sound so much like a current affairs debate on TV. As far as I'm concerned, this was the only fault of this lovely movie, I'd rate it even higher without it."
2003,"Every one need to watch! Unexpected and cool plot.
And actors are very good!"
2004,"This is the best murder mystery movie I've seen since Shutter Island, it had me guessing till the end. One of the best overall cast I have seen in a long while and each person played their role well."
2005,"The movie is fun to watch. It kept you glued to the seat. The audience in the theater were disappointed to see an interval.
One is assured of entertainment watching this movie."
2006,"This movie says its a nod to classic Agatha Christie -style detective stories. This is pretty much exactly what this movie is in reality. The story is more funny than it's dramatic, but in the end you like and hate the right characters. Casting is mostly spot on and the rest of it is not an issue in the big picture. Parts of the plot are quite easy to guess in advance, but the movie has multiple ""big reveals"" and several more little once, so it does not really matter if you guessed some of it pretty early on (and even if you did, you never could be totally sure...)."
2007,"Going into the movie, I was not expecting some comedy in the film. I find the slight comedy to be really refreshing and was surprised by all the twists and turns in the story. The movie had a nice, but unexpected ending. Watch it to find out. :)"
2008,"I didn't saw many of criminal movies, bit... This is just amazing! The best criminal movie I have ever seen!"
2009,"If you want an original movie with a good story and a great cast (who doesn't?) then look no further than ""Knives out.""This movie is obviously going to appeal most to those that love mysteries/whodunnits, but it does turn the idea on its head and doesn't take itself to seriously. Making for a gripping, unpredictable story that should appeal to most.The movie is unique, rewards you for paying attention and is so crammed with great actors that there should be someone for everyone in there. Quality."
2010,"This movie appealed to me straight away, mostly since Jaeden Martell from IT is in it. I enjoyed Murder on The Orient Express, a film similar to this another who dunnit with the build up to quite an unexpectable ending sort of like this. When I saw the trailer I automatically thought that Chris Evans had to be the murderer with his horrible and unlikeable character but then like a quarter way through its revealed that Ana de Armas, Marta the nurse, had accidently switched Harlan's medicine and lost the antidonte rendering him dead in 10 mins so to save his dear friend from a murder charge he slits his throat. From then on its an exciting rolooer coaster with twists and turns and comedic momentts such as Marta's attempts to hide evidence and her vomiting into random things after lying. As Jamie lee Curtis says ""Waiting for the big reveal."" I wasn't disapointed. It is revealed that Ransom has switched the contents of the medications wanting his familys will back after finding outt it had all been left to Marta which meant she had given him the correct stuff meaning his death was truly suicide. I loved the way they played this out, you never knew what would happen next, the comedy and the reveal of Ransoms crafty murder attempt. Don't think they could of done it any better, all I could ask is more screen time for Jaeden Martell. My favourite film of the year for definate!"
2011,"This movie is different from other detective-murder movies, but it still brings a lot of effect that makes it fun and entertaining till the very end"
2012,This is a very fun movie that kept me entertained throughout.
2013,"That's the problem with this movie too! That's why a 7 instead of an 8 or even 9.The detective never explains how he reached his conclusions at the end. That's a recurring problem with every movie or TV series based on Agatha Christie's novels, without exception!"
2014,"Writing is outstanding, infused with a surprising amount of unexpected humour.
Rian Johnson has created an extremely thrilling crime drama, that uses the collective skills of its excellent cast to great effect. 'Knives Out' makes a strong case as one of the best films of the year and a definitive murder mystery for the ages.
Complete Star cast are fantastic. Daniel Craig completely throws you off with a thick and heavy Southern accent Go and watch it."
2015,"If you go to see a film to look for critique, goofs and bloopers, then go to see this film. If you go to see a film for a good night out, then go to see this film. You'll be so wowed by the story line and it's wonderful laugh out loud moments, that you will just enjoy the film for what it is. 2 hours and 10 minutes of pure joy. Mr Craig's southern American drawl accent that is only dropped once, is quite endearing and who would know that there is a condition whereby you throw up if you lie? I can not remember being entertained so much and thoroughly recommend it."
2016,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film! A great cast and top-notch script. A rare combination of wit, style, and heart. A star-making performance by Ana de Armas, and a wonderfully weird turn by Daniel Craig."
2017,It was nice and funny! 🤘👍 Didn't expect Captain America is there. 🤣 I also suspected that grandpa is still alive. the thrill was so great.
2018,Having seen all of his movies with the exception of his Star Wars (I have very strong views on SW) I have seen everything that he's done somehow. And I can honestly say that he is incapable of making a good movie. He is the perfect example of a film student where he's seen everything and has analyzed the techniques and methods but doesn't understand the art behind them. He didn't understand the feeling and why those great directors did what they did.In his attempt to be artiste he comes across as disingenuine and contrived. He really loves Wes Anderson and tries to copy his camera style without coming up with his own style in the process. He doesn't use inspiration as a launching pad he uses it as a Bible to follow. And he tries to give his characters a trait like the Cohen's but when it's every character it doesn't come across as natural.And his humor is terrible. Either the timing or the writing I don't know but he can't do it.Writers and directors use their instincts to feel what is right and wrong and I think Johnson looks at every single word and moment and analyses it to understand the effect it will have. He has no instincts. He has no style. He should be directing TV show episodes where he belongs.This movies exemplifies all of his bad qualities.
2019,"It looks friking amazing, please someone upload pirate so i can watch too !!"
2020,If you are a thriller lover you are going to love this
2021,"Rian Johnson makes a 'Agatha Christie/Clue' hybrid with aplomb, with the plot holding up to multiple viewings and post-viewing thoughts.The cast is positively perfect, and you can tell how excited they are to be in this film. Each character spits out their lines with immense pleasure.It was so good, I managed to get both my Father and Father-in-law to watch it, and they both loved it (former is a movie buff, latter hasn't watched a movie in the cinema in 15 years)."
2022,"Initially I thought this film was going to be a predictable ""Clue"" whodunnit style movie. But it's so original and fun, I was on the edge of my seat the whole time! Bravo!"
2023,"Knives Out is Rian Johnson's latest feature-film and this film shows that the guy has a real knack for twisty storytelling and that he's a multi-genre man of his trade. Yes the guy directed The Last Jedi, which has adversely affected some people's perceptions of this movie, but this film is a totally different beast of an experience. And I'd say this film's easily better than The Last Jedi.Knives Out follows the story of mystery-author Harlan Thrombey's death and how The Thrombey Family deals with the fallout of the chaos: and through this set-up we get the best Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot-inspired character in a long while: Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig. The film's something of a miracle: it's a whodunit story with an all-star ensemble of Hollywood actors and it's NOT a sequel or adaptation of a pre-existing work from Agatha Christie or Arthur Conan Doyle, though you can definitely feel their influence in the highly complex and intellectual nature of their stories in Knives Out.This film's got super-sleuth galore in its cast of characters and writing, and it's got some truly fantastic cinematography to go with it. It's so well directed, thought-out and realized that it's easily one of 2019's most daring cinematic outings; it shows that the British aren't alone in doing great whodunits, and there's plenty of variety to work with in crime fiction in today's world.Knives Out is pretty damn solid cinema and an achievement for Rian Johnson. It's great, especially on the big screen."
2024,"Cast was perfect, story is very good and acting was excellent. The girl playing immigrant chick was hot and the girl from 13 reasons why looked plumpy. Daniel Craig looked and acted great."
2025,"This movie was really fun, smart and engaging. It is an extremely strong 8. Almost a 9 but the ending twist could have been handled a bit less basic."
2026,"""Blades out of the scabbard"" ""Everyone is only willing to believe the truth they see, but the real truth is there. What you need is to distinguish between the true and false."" Today, with the decline of inferential novels, Agatha Christina and her readers still create such wonderful stories for us. Just as the film title is different from general reasoning films, the screenwriter used Marta's narrative in the first half of the film to let us stand in the perspective of God to watch the progress of this story and this human drama. But the truth we think is only what we are willing to believe. The screenwriter has brought all the audience into his narrative trap. That is, what we think is not the true truth. The story of the movie is ups and downs, and it gives me a long-lost feeling that is completely like reading an inferential novel! And after perfectly telling this story, it still satirizes the most fragile and dark thing of humanity, the bug in the first half In the end, the self-consistent and echoing of the story should be the most injured marta, she had a chance to save halan. '' Drysdale's family, the evil house of the ""Deformed House"", is the real family of halan. They only care about themselves and abandon their love. They mocked the immigration status of marta and claimed that it was like a family to marta but it was really harmful In their own interests, they will pull out the sharp blade to the weaker."
2027,Heard a bit of good rumors about Knives Out. It was too slow paced for me. It was just bizarre. Many characters I didn't care about. The story was difficult to keep up with. The murder wasn't even too interesting to want to find out who did it. I might try to watch the whole thing. The best thing was Daniel Craig. He played a cool character.3 stars
2028,"From Looper to Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Arian Johnson has been a filmmaker on the rise for the last number of years. Although many Star Wars fans seem to not like his addition to the Star Wars franchise, I loved it and I believe him to be one of the greatest directors out there today. My love for him as a filmmaker alone had me excited for his newest release in Knives Out. He took a step backward since his last outing, writing a directing a very small movie with a very large feel. This move was the best thing he could have possibly done for his career, because he has made one hell of a crowd pleaser. Knives Out is terrific and here's why it's worth your time.Following the death of Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer), his entire family is questioned about his sudden demise. Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) oversees this investigation and believes there to be a lot hidden under the surface of this story. This begins the story and classic ""whodunnit"" feel. There is something that feels very tradition about this movie, with updated dialogue and very unique camerawork to make it a fantastic watch. This movie is pretty much as good as you can get with a story like this these days. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Knives Out.I can praise Rian Johnson for writing a clever screenplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat, which is does, or I can gush about the precise cinematography that is incredibly well-done, but this film is held together by an insanely talented cast who are all having a blast. If not for this stellar cast committing to these wacky and hilarious characters, then Knives Out would have been pretty boring. This movie benefits from the comedy and I think this cast has a lot to do with that. With that said, this film isn't quite perfect.Even though nitpicking a movie like this is kind of ridiculous, due to the nature of it needing to contain twists and turns, I have to admit that the movie is slightly predictable, even though it leads you to believe it's not. Without ruining anything, it becomes fairly obvious where things will go after a certain point, so that was a detriment for me. Thankfully, the way everything is presented is very clever and definitely showcases the reveals in ways you're not expecting. Even if you figure out what happened, you won't be able to predict how it happened, and I really appreciated that aspect.In the end, Knives Out has a nice blend of suspense and comedy to keep almost audiences engaged. I found this blend to be great and would happily revisit these characters again in the future. With fantastic writing and directing by Rian Johnson and a cast that's giving their all in the funnest way possible, it's hard not to like this one. For fans of murder mysteries, comedies, or even any of these performers, I highly recommend checking out Knives Out."
2029,I found it very entertaining! I enjoy watch this film! 👍👍👍
2030,"""Until you can't tell the difference between a stage prop and a real knife"" - Harlan says to Marta in the attic in the beginning.
Harlan wanted to die. And planned is own suicyde to the most smaller detail!
Even the title suggest it!
He planned to die (as a gamer he is referred to be) with one of his games, where he furthermore from dying, planned a lesson too is whole family especially for is completely ""stupid but confident"" grandson. By the talks he add in the night of his birthday, he predicted the behavior of all his relatives, and, justified by the ""oh, Ransom"" talk in the attic, predicted the stupid and reckless behavior that Ransom would have after being left on his own. So he made all the plan! Purposely throwing the game to the ground, inducing Marta to an error, that would annul the switch of the glasses (a way of murder that he predicted Ransom would do, as he know he is a good player), and free Marta from mistakenly killing him! And dying on his will, because he ""doesn't fear death anymore""!!
Finally he switches the knives, by knowing how is grandson was going to act, ""Until you can't tell the difference between a stage prop and a real knife"", and saving Marta. (I do not believe that having all those knives as decoration, the propose would be for them all to be prop knives.) And he enfatizes that by staying the knife in the attic' table, where probably that knife would have been a prop knife.
I know that probably I'm just making some assumption, but the Easter eggs in this film are aligned in such an order, that I can really see this to be the bigger plot in here!!
What do you think?"
2031,"Go watch this movie with family and friends. Worth every penny. Amazing Story. The twists in this movie are unexpected. Well Directed and Superbly Acted. Daniel Craig was Excellent as the detective. Chris Evans was great too and so were the other cast members. Ana De armas was spectacular. I was spellbound by her screen presence. The climax scenes were fantastic and applause worthy. The screenplay and narration of this movie is worth mentioning. A murder mystery movie that includes satirical comedy, twist and turns, a dysfunctional family and the dumbest car chase ever!!! Highly recommend

2035,"First Off Let Me Just Say That I'm a Fan Of All These All Star Cast Stars Which includes Chris Evans From Marvel's Captain America Film Franchises, Scream Queen Horror Icon Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson From The 80's icon TV Show "" Maimi Vice"" Toni Collette From 2006's ""Little Miss Sunshine"" The Newest James Bond Star Daniel Craig, Michael Shannon From Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"", The Gangster TV Show ""Boardwalk Empire"" And The Bopic Film ""The Runaways"" That's Based On a True Story Of The 70s Rock Group Called The Runaways And Lease But Not Lease The Great Christopher Plummer From The Classic Musical Film ""The Sound Of Music"" Anyways When i Saw The Trailer For This Film ""Knives Out"" And Saw These Cool Cast That Were Going To Be in it i Was Now This is My Kind Of Film That i Want To See Because I'm a Big Fan Of Murder Mystery And Whodunit Movies Epespecially The Agatha Christie Ones Like ""Murder On The Orient Express"" And ""Death On a Nile"" Because Those Films Had Great Ensemble Cast Film Stars Or Even ""Clue The Movie"" Which is Based On The Popular Board Game With Tim Curry And Christopher Lloyd, But in These New Whodunit Film ""Knives Out"" Which is Directed By Rain Johnson Who Made 2005s ""Brick"" And 2012s ""Looper"" That Both Films Started Joseph Gordon Levitt And 2017s ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" Now Directed This Movie Knives Out Which i Have To Say it Was Excellent And Well Done Murder And Mystery Movie With Edgy Humor And Terrific Performances Epespecially The Character Of Daniel Craig Who Plays Kinda Like The Hercule Poirot Character in The Agatha Christie Mystery Books Except This Character Benoit Blanic Has a Foghorn Leghorn Southern Accent Which To Me Was Super Funny And i Thought This is a Completely Different Kinda Role That Daniel Craig Has Not Played Before And He Played it Very Excellent, Also This Movie Knives Out Stars Two Movie Icons Don Johnson And Jamie Lee Curtis Which i Thought These Two Starts Were Superb Who Husband And Wife Linda And Richard Drysdale Also Along For The Ride is Always The Great Michael Shannon As Walt Thrombey, Chris Evans As Ransom Drysdale Who Plays a Mysterious Character With A Suspicious Motive, Toni Collette As Joni Thrombey Was Great But The One Great Star in This Movie That i Enjoyed The Most is The Character Of Marta Cabrera Played By Ana De Armas Who i Think Delivers An impressive Performance And Now Comes Another Movie Legend Star is Christopher Plummer Who Plays The ill Fated Character Of Harlan Drysdale Who May Commit Suicide Or Been Murdered But He Does Have One Great Movie Scene Moment Before His Character Meets His Demise is The Scene That His Character is Telling His Nurse Caregiver Marta As He Tells Her His Plan And How He Really Likes Marta a Lot And That He Trusted Her, Even Christopher Plummer Doesn't Have Much Screentime Except Flashback Scenes But He Still is a Legendary Actor And I'm Glad He Got To Work With Some Great Stars."
2036,Damn good movie but I figured out the butler did it like 5 minutes in.
2037,They took the Clue board game and out it on the big screen!
2038,"The conceit is that someone injected with 100 mg of morphine IV would die in 8 minutes: our patriarch is able to plan how to absolve his nurse who injected him with that much in that 8 minute span, and commit his final act to seal the deal.In fact, someone injected with 100 mg of morphine would be immediately incapacitated, and would die of oxygen starvation as a result of his not breathing, due to suppression of his respiratory center by the morphine sulfate, in around 8 minutes or so. She is later called a ""good nurse"": a good nurse would have recognized immediately if she had overdosed a patient with morphine, and there would have been no argument about calling for help, at least not from the patient.but once you get past that sniveling detail, the movie is great. has lots of twists and turns, and is genuinely entertaining. and to hear that accent from Craig is just hilarious. his dialect coach had his work cut out for him.Seeing Jamie Lee Curtis had me scurrying to the mirror, and sadly, it has happened to me, too."
2039,"Wether it is for leading role or supporting role, please give an Oscar nomination to Ana de Armas.I have seen her before in films, like War Dogs and this is the performance of her career.The Golden Globe voting is happening right now, so there is a good chance for her. Also considering that there is a strong push for diversity among the nominations, her Cuban background should help.Excellent screenplay, producing and directing by Rian Johnson. Silver Spring, Maryland has produced some great people.Excellent acting by al truly all-star cast: Christopher Plummer, Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson, Toni Collette and others.But . . . please give some consideration to Ana de Armas for a well deserved nomination. it is my humble request."
2040,"This is a great movie. You go in expecting one thing, but it turns into something completely different - and in the best way possible. It's an homage to the classic Murder Mystery stories, yet still maintains enough creativity and personality to stay strong on its own. Also, the ensemble cast was used perfectly. Despite small roles, each actor gave very distinct performances. Overall, a very well-made movie."
2041,"The plot twist at the end was so good. I wasn't expecting that. The casting was brilliant and Ana De Armas was amazing as well as Daniel Craig, not forgetting the hunk Chris Evans (Hugh Ransom Drysdale). It was a very good film and i enjoyed it a lot."
2042,I really enjoyed watching the show. Watch for the end.
2043,"I like this movie - it's very well done. Good cast, good story. But it is also political propaganda. I do not think that is wrong or bad, I like the First Amendment. However, anyone watching this should turn on their thinking cap and realize this isn't just a lighthearted whodunit. The final scene SPOILER is literally the Dreamer standing above the entitled white people. Nice.
Now making fun of entitled rich kids is a comedy stand-by (paging Spaulding Smails). But any downtrodden member of society could have been the heroine. No, it's a dreamer. A very Hollywood stereotype dreamer. Whose boss knows her plight but only choses to remedy the situation after his death. Very much like Thomas Jefferson freeing his slaves after he died. What a gent! And in the film those who stand for legal due process and, for a better term, ""rules"" are portrayed as right-wing monsters.
I suppose Rian Johnson doesn't have any relatives petitioning ICE for legal migration. Why wait those 12-20 years to get your loved one into the country legally when you can just come here, work hard and make yourself a success. Because people aren't illegal. Just their actions, like Jeff Skilling. He didn't hurt anyone, did he?So I like the film. You just should be forewarned it has a very very lefty message that is being used to indoctrinate you if you are not thinking independently."
2044,"Truly enjoyed being led through the investigation and its twists and turns. Great actors presenting a solid dysfunctional family, with some new ideas to frame an traditional Agatha Christie type concept. Appreciated the light comedy throughout to make it a lighter experience than a full on detective flick."
2045,"No weak link in this cast, masterful storytelling overall although it started to drag in the second half. worth watching for the performances alone, they've hired the most charismatic character actors in hollywood."
2046,"One of the first crime/mystery movies that has impressed me and stumped me in a long time. Most of the time I can guess the twist or who did it in the first third of the movie, but this had me questioning everything. It also really reminded me of Clue which is a plus for me."
2047,"Well written and acted, this film plays out like a longer episode of the television version of Fargo.The direction is crisp and the all-star cast does a great job!I lked this movie a lot."
2048,"F_ _ _ ing awesome.
Intersting all the time.
In my opinion it should be 9+ rating."
2049,"Great movie full mystery, drama and a touch of comedy
I loved the storyline and actors. They did an amazing job! It's not scary at all which is awesome because I HATE scary movies."
2050,"Couple Daniel Craig's dodgy accent....with an unexpected comedy ending....add aging actors JLC, DJ and TC and a decent storyline = 7..."
2051,"Story line is, let's say common for films of this genre, but the that will nail you to the chair is fantastic casting, sceenes, house it's selfe and unbearable lightness of acting"
2052,"This film is done very well, the cast the places , it was beautifully done but ... it represented nothing new. a normal mystery and it was so obvious who did the crime. the only thing that was new is the idea of the girl who throws up wen she lie it helped us in the story and made it more obvious than it is."
2053,I have watched so many movies with mystery including plot twist. But there are few of them that I remember very well. This movie I think i can wach a thousand times! Perfection!
2054,"In a world full of Marvel superheroes and remakes of old movies comes a remake of an old idea. However this does seem fresh and keeps the interest for the whole length.
An outstandingly pleasant way to spend a few hours and very reminiscent of the also excellent Nero Wolfe series of the early noughties."
2055,"Great collection of players doing a great job of playing.
But I found it so boring after the set-up that I FFWD thru at least 30 mins.
Christopher Plummer as always, very strong. Always happy to see Toni Collette.
I never knew Don Johnson could actually act. He's very good in this."
2056,"This movie was one of the best mystery problem solving films I have ever seen. For starters, the film was kind of like a usual film with suspense and drama, action and a mighty twist at the end to spice things up. But the twist did spice things up, which makes it one of the best. But first the cast. Chris Evans hasn't done many other films other than big blockbuster Marvel films, so to see him not in a red and blue hero suit was different and makes everyone realise that he is a good actor and not just a action hero. Bit like Arnold Schwarzenegger, sorry Arnold. But overall, I believe that Chris Evans did a good job as Ransom Drysdale. The main character of this film was thankfully a woman, played by the beautiful Ana De Armas who has previously shown her talents in the very successful add on to the 1982 Blade Runner, in the film Blade Runner 2049. She has shown the world that she has talent and portrays her talent very well in this film. She makes the character feel like an everyday person, like it was based on a real life individual. Which makes you realise that some people deserve more. Throughout the film, I believe she was a delight to witness on the big screen. Also, I loved Marta's psychological condition of not being able to lie; otherwise it makes her throw up. That has to be one of the best script writing effects I have seen in a film. And last but not least, James Bond. Wait, not James Bond; Detective Benoit Blanc. Who was played by none than the other, Daniel Craig. I would say that Daniel Craig did struggle on the accent from time to time, in scenes you can see him mess a few of his lines. But on the other hand, the way he portrayed the mystery of his character throughout the whole film was marvellous. He did make me think that the case was all closed with around 20 minutes of the film remaining. But it carried on, in an ultimate twist. Also, the walking stick does add a strange but decent effect when he doesn't have a limp but makes him look like a detective.
In other news, the editing of this film I believe was well done. It wasn't award winning but they did a good job to make us feel the suspense and mystery. For example, in the closing scene of the film the family are out of the drive way looking at the murderer drive off in a police vehicle and looking up to someone. The close shots of the character up on the balcony made us see the emotions and the high pitched music made us ask the question, what happens now? The cinematography, I believed was outstanding. All the specific choices of camera shots and locations were brilliantly planned. They made me feel like I was in the room with all the characters and watching from behind the scenes of what was going to happen. Which brings me to the location of this film set. The film was filmed in many locations, including Maynard, Waltham, Easton etc. But the main set for this film is the Ames Mansion in Borderland State Park. This film set was precisely the best set for this film. The mansion shows the wealth of the family and also shows the discreetness of the family. Which is a big effect in the character's individual stories. Also the characters fashion sense. I am no modeller, but pretty sure anyone can tell who is wealthy and who isn't. For example, all the related family are wearing expensive jumpers and even the little kid (Jacob Thrombrey), played by the uprising star from the hit movie ""IT"" (Jaeden Martel), wears an expensive looking suit. All of these effects adds to the character backstory of this family.
Overall, I believe that this film was one of the best mystery problem solving films of all time. And with the numerous number of nominations they received, even a Oscar nomination for Writing (Original Screenplay) for Rian Johnson, it was a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch and get your head round. It very much so, does make you think of who could it be and why and how? Which is why I am rating this film a 9 out of 10."
2057,"This was a visually stunning, tightly told mystery with a phenomenal cast. The story was very well crafted with great details that give the viewer a false sense of security. The audience gets to see the details of the murder right at the beginning and our best witness has a condition that has her projectile vomiting if she even thinks about telling a lie. The cast of characters are not only well dressed but full of quirks that have you paying attention to the little details. This is a mystery inside of a mystery...or a donut with a hole inside another donut with a hole, as our tenacious and very southern New Yorker profiled detective would say.The story has us following along with an immigrant nurse who's aging successful mystery writer employer, played by Christopher Plummer, has just been found to have committed suicide and she has been asked along with the rest of the household and family members to come back to the house, a large secluded Victorian, to be reinterviewed by the police about the night of the suicide. In attendance with the local police is a new face, that of Daniel Craig's character...the successful southern detective who has been hired anonymously to look in to the suicide. Right away you discover he has a knack for telling truth from lies...and does appear quite good at his job.Shortly after the start of the film, we discover that our sweet, kind and caring nurse, who everyone seems to love and say is a part of their family, made a mistake in her employer's nightly medication...giving him a deadly dose of morphine. In thinking he has just 10 minutes left to live helps her figure out a way to not get blamed for his murder.Thus sets up the true story of our protagonist, who has accidentally killed her employer, vs our antagonist, our dogged detective who uses her to help him get to the bottom of the crime in a unique and fun cat and mouse game that has us rooting for our sweet and innocent little mouse.A lot of dark humor is written in to the script including the ongoing joke that no one in the family seems to know where our nurse and her family are from...other than somewhere south of the border...Brazil? Ecuador?, every time it is a different country. But my favorite bit is when Plummer's character first hears about the medication mishap, he is all 'hey, that's a great idea for an upcoming book!' and starts writing it down.This was a great tightly told story, with a lot of attention paid it the details, it has a phenomenal cast with great acting and beautiful costumes and sets.I highly recommend giving it a viewing."
2058,"I didn't know anything about the plot but still it was very predictable and it never really ""took off""."
2059,Finally! An original whodunnit. Rian Johnson or however you pronounce his name pulls out one from the bag with a huge cast of stars.
2060,"Dynamic and complicated plots. For a mystery movie, it is usual to focus on one crime and the process of unwinding the secrets of that crime. For 'Knives
Out', by adding one more question 'who sent the letter to hire the private detective?', the depth of conundrum gets deeper and the mystery gets layered. When I was watching this movie, the director does a good job of navigating through mystery 'with' the audience and of making them engaged and tense. However, after the movie, I do not have the feeling of clarity as a closure. As I go over the plot, I keep asking questions to each character's intention, action, and the motive once again because the screenplay does not persuade me. To sum up, this movie lacks or this movie cannot get there."
2061,"Great mix of comedy, suspense and story.
Well crafted always keeping you guessing and thinking without being hard to follow.
The cast had stand out performances.
Felt like the real life Cluedo
110% worth watching"
2062,"Ha. What a blast. Good old fashioned who dunnit. Nothing to complicated or over done, but we'll paced, amusing and well plotted. Daniel Craigs accent is utterly rediculous but eventually you get used to it, and of course he is always good value. So all in all very entertaining."
2063,"Impressive script
simply put Its a modern-day Agatha Christie murder-mystery ,and i love it.
a stellar cast - charming in every regard.
a beautiful gothic mansion and the alluring Massachusetts country side makes it a perfect detective story.
a lovely alternative to all of the serious stuff of life right now.A Fabulous Movie ."
2064,"So amazing, you keep trying to find out the killer, and everytime surprise more. Besides seeing Chris Evans in those outfits it is just highly recommended."
2065,I enjoyed this movie I look forward to some more like this in the future
2066,"It's a dying genre because it's dumb and unoriginal, but this movie gives life to the whodunnit. It's still pretty bad, though."
2067,"Overall it was well done, kept me entertained. However, Daniel Craig's voice was annoying. A thick southern accent that sounded like he had copied Kevin Spacey in ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil."""
2068,"We found out most of the truth within the first half hour and the end 'twist' wasn't very surprising at all, so I wouldn't call it a murder mystery. It's meant to be a comedy but it wasn't funny. But...it was entertaining and I enjoyed watching it. Tony Collette and Daniel Craig's accents weren't great but it was light hearted fun and easy to watch.
The vomit gag (no pun intended) was a bit strange and not really needed. But I enjoyed the setting and camera work."
2069,"People ripping this movie are expecting way too much.
They give it 5 or 6 stars and savage it because it is not perfect.
The fact is, a decent movie is hard to find now adays.
Didn't care for the political commentary but I guess the director felt that is obligatory in contemporary culture.
I enjoyed watching Plummer, Johnson and Craig perform.
I hoped there would be more Benoit Blanc movies and sure enough, a sequel is in the works!
If you are a user critic, don't be so quick to take your Knives Out!"
2070,A twisty Agatha Christie like mystery with a stellar ensemble cast.
2071,"I consider this my favorite murder film after ""Evil under the Sun"".This movie is most definitely filled with a blend of suspense, comedy, and dramatic arguments.
The casting of Chris Evans, Daniel Craig, and Christopher Plummer made this movie filled with complete excitement.I recommend this to anyone who would like to have action at all times during the film they are watching."
2072,Vale muito a pena conferir! Ótimo roteiro e atuação. O enredo é viciante e você realmente se envolve com a história
2073,Great movie! Plot was well written... amazingly casted.... if your a mystery fan you'll enjoy this movie
2074,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningOn the night of his eighty fifth birthday, millionaire Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer) is found murdered in his room at the top of his mansion, plunging his family, including Linda (Jamie Lee Curtis), her husband Richard (Don Johnson), Walt (Michael Shannon), and Joni (Toni Collette) into a flurry of speculation as to who the killer could be. Attention falls on Marta (Ana de Armas) the South American carer of Harlan, who emerges as closer to Harlan than they thought. Detective Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) must use all his sleuthing skills to get to the bottom of it all, as black sheep of the family Ransom (Chris Evans) comes back on the scene.Upon its initial release, near enough this time last year, writer/director Rian Johnson's all star murder mystery emerged as unfortunately titled, as controversy emerged surrounding the release of the film Blue Story, allegedly sparking mass brawls in cinemas around the country, on the back of a 'knife crime' epidemic (before COVID-19 had even been heard of.) This was, of course, a massive contextual double standard, and simply geared towards the delightfully old fashioned crime thriller it's aiming to be.In a generation of cinema where the target demographic's attention span is visibly reduced, eagerly awaiting the release of the next Avengers or Fast & Furious film, Johnson's sprawling crime saga is an ode to a time where attention must be paid to every detail, in order not to miss a clue. There is an undeniable political slant to it, with it's immigrant hero merging triumphant, and main characters debating the pros and cons of immigration, alluding to Trump in a non too subtle way, but not to the detriment of the story, which keeps you hooked all the way to the end.It's a game of Cluedo come to life, with an all star cast delivering stunning portrayals of conflicting eccentrics, each plotting against each other for their own grubby ends. It's an eccentric, original piece of work in and of itself, though, which stands out in an age of interchangeable guff. ****"
2075,"Certainly not what I was expecting, in a good way. It's clever, it's witty, and most importantly, it's compelling. Also, to be noted, no detail is left unused; everything you see will, at some point, contribute to the narrative.An easy recommendation!"
2076,I don't have a lot to say about this film. It was Mediocre. I had to ask my friend if I was supposed to be laughing because I heard it was a comedy and thankfully she said no. I just don't understand the hype. And the throwing up gag was teenage humor that wasn't needed. I will literally only remember that because it grossed me out so much.
2077,Everything is brilliant! From start to finish! Every moment! Woooow! Love it!
2078,In the world of Marvel this was a refreshing treat
2079,"Ok, I know what the title says, but hear me out. I love this movie. The tone, the scenery, the editing style, the one vs all rules, rule the consistency of brown, yellow and orange/teal tones in every scene, amazing. My problem is with Ransom. His character throughout the movie, while acting like a badass, seemed to chill. If he knew about all of this, how could he hide it this much, and also not even try anything, due to the fact he knows it's his family's money, and barely try's anything to get it back. Now I know, your gonna say, ""but it's for character development, he needs to befriend her before he can try anything!"" While those are fair points, I say to you this, what would you do in that situation? Your family's fortune has been placed in possession of some, and you need to get it back. What do you do? Wait it out and trick her into giving the money back? Or just take it and bring it back to your family? Think on that, and then rewatch the movie."
2080,"And I don't get much attention either. the end is not WOW. idk. it's not the best movie, the truth"
2081,"I find the movie idea good. I could tolerate Craig's strange accent up to certain point even. The actors were really trying and the whole ensemble was really excellent.
Only the stick with which we were treated to learn the lesson was maybe to hard and used too often. I managed half of the movie and at this point I had to pause the stream. I am sorry. I appreciate the hard deal quite some migrants get. I am an immigrant myself. But this is just too much. It may be that if done 10ya and seen 10ya this would not be so striking. I do not think so but maybe I am just too biased after string of movies that showed the same characteristic.
You can have strong female and immigrant characters in less obnoxious and self-righteous way. After I ended the misery with this I watched max payne and here you had exactly that (and a shootout). Here is a detective story where intellect fights intellect as well as emotions. Or rather should have done that but could not because woke prevented that.
I would have given it 1 if not for the cast and original idea. Convoluted as they all are in a detective stories it still could carry a film but not if one has to watch for ideology all the time.
Give it to Critical Drinker for rewrite - it does not take much, you know. I am sure it could be saved. I mean the idea."
2082,"While the fairly dense plot of this movie is certainly *clever*, fast paced, and structured in a way that never loses you and leaves the big bits for the end, it completely lacks all heart and soul. It's rather pleased with its smarmy, low brow rich d-bag characters and outting their rottenness with a maximum of irony and slappy wit. Start to absolute finish. Snore. What would have been unpredictable and satisfying by the end, is if someone in this garbage family did one right thing for one right reason, and it wasn't just the outsider who was decent. I'd be fine if she was the only ""winner"" at the end, I would just liked to have seen a glimmer of unpredictable humanity even in dark places. How clever and fresh can something be if trope characters fall to trope fates and motives? Give me a break.And also, just disregard the dumb reviews that see this as some ""woke"" angle. Biased minds make for biased viewing. I can say with absolute certainty that Knives OUt completely skewers liberal elitists and the rich right in exactly the same way. The fact that the nurse is a CHILD OF, NOT HERSELF an immigrant is absolutely immaterial. It was only necessary that she was not related to them, and of few means. Her mother's status or her own accent has nothing to do with her characterization and very little to do with the plot.This does not need to be politically biased to kind of suck. And kind of suck it does."
2083,"Knives out has got some some big actors in no doubt about That. The actors and actresses are good, but the storyline was rather boring. I love murder mystery films but this was so predictable from the beginning I knew straight away who it was. They hyped this film Up to much and I was so disappointed as was really looking forward to watching. There was no twists or turns and no suspense. A pretty boring film to be honest don't why this as got high ratings is beyond me. Don't waste and bother watching the film"
2084,"The most popular whodunnit mystery genre is back in a fancy, non-groundbreaking and enthrallingly delivered story about a murder and its resolution by private eye Benoit Blanc. Overall the movie is entertaining as well as well-realised in the modern world. In a world were cameras, smartphones and internet reign, ""getting away with murder"" Agatha Christie style is not easy to pull off.However, Rian Johnson proves his worth as a talented director and writer with this film. After his unfortunate contribution to the Star Wars lore, many were scrutinizing his later works to try to proof his seemingly ""unworthiness"" to contribute to such a famous saga. Hopefully this entry would prove them wrong.It's always hard to talk about the plot of a Clue-like movie such as this as the mystery is the central core of it. Therefore, I'll focus on the performances of the cast and the development of the case itself. Contrary to other movies and books of the similar genre, this film takes some liberties that may be new to it(I haven't watched every movie of the whodunnit genre so I can't confirm this case). It doesn't really follow the private detective. I'd say he isn't the ""main protagonist"" of this story at all. Or at least the story isn't channeled through him. At the end of the day, it's not his home where the audience goes to rest from the case, it's someone else's. And I am afraid saying the name might reveal a clue so I'll just not mention it at all.I'd say the performances are extraordinary and enthralling but that is not the case because they are almost nonexistent. The biggest downside the movie has is that it features a lot of talent with an impressive track record and yet they are misused. They seem to be there merely to bring in big names to lure people in to watch it. But each participation serves a very superficial role in the story and after that they are nowhere to be found. In fact, it'd be incredibly damaging if the movie didn't turn out to be greatly performed by those who have more screen time/are central to the plot and the story itself wasn't so well delivered and paced.As for the development of the case, I'd say it isn't too convoluted nor is it trying to be to confuse the audience. It doesn't want to create a complex mystery in order to make the audience gasp at the reveal of the culprit. However this reveal is a staple of the genre so expect it and look foward to it. I simply personally thought it was given away too soon in the story and from then on there wasn't much mystery left. And again, I feel the misuse of the other characters missed the opportunity to suggest other possible culprits that would have added more ""juice"" to the mystery.However, there are very few subplots to keep track of so everything is understood from the beginning. There is no reason to have to focus on the details and scene clues and hints, no matter how subtle they are, to keep up or allow the audience to come to those conclusions by themselves. Something I personally think it's one of the genre's highlights as they make me ""feel smarter"" and even more involved in the plot. Additionally, I also believe it robs the movie of a more dramatic reveal of the culprit as well as its very own rewatchability. The plot is too straightforward and un-entangled to leave the audience wanting to figure it out on their own. But again, the simplicity of the plot may have been a director's choice and the focus of the movie might have lied elsewhere.IN CONCLUSION, this movie is perfectly entertaining, easy to watch and follow, and amusing at some points. It's high level cast provide a good performance despite the little dialog and intervention they had they made the most of it and it contributes to the movie. The case was interesting, well-paced and delivered and straightforward. The ""twist"" is not really its strongest suit nor is it its whodunnit convoluted multi-focused plot development. So in other words, it contributes to the genre and doesn't really redefine it, so hardcore mystery fans may be underwhelmed with it. Especially after all the praise it received and is receiving. It's simply average with good entertainment value."
2085,I think i prefer Daniel Craig as beefcake James Bond.I hate these massive Hollywood ensemble movies. IT reminds me of remakes of Murder on the Orient Express. Underperformed written and acted. Are we supposed to give extra credit for the shear weight of Hollywood salary?The only good part was the scene where Craig reveals all. And it was a good twist. But the rest of it didn't lead there.
2086,"If you like BBC lighthearted mysteries, old Miss Marple movies, clever whodunnits, etc, forget this movie. Narration over many scenes, almost all the action recast as flashback, detective is a funny part but Craig couldn't pull it off--totally miscast, Main character vomits a lot. I got the feeling the writer imagined it totally differently. If you are doing a lot of vomit scenes for comedy, then really it was supposed to be over the top humour. I've seen dozens of fun clever movies much better than this one. I mean, even sort of weak TV shows with funny detectives solving crimes have better scripts. All the great actors are not well used and don't give good performances, so maybe that's the director who is responsible for that."
2087,It's ok but the pace and style lets it down. If it were like The Grand Budapest Hotel or Clue or even murder she wrote it would have been much better.
2088,"After all the praise and glory by film critics, I was completely disappointed with the story and speed of the film. The vomiting could have only been better it she followed it by a shart; then maybe I would have given it a 6."
2089,"Intriguing since the beginning, playing with cliches and characters jumping from one genre to another.
It does not require a second viewing but definitely deserves hundreds.
It becomes funnier after every watch.
The casting was astounding, the characters seemed written for each actors.
Hopefully writer director Ryan Johnson will be able to have more freedom after this astonishing flick.P.S. Toni Collette performance was probably one of the best of her career."
2090,"My whole family are huge fans of movies like this, and we were really pleasantly surprised when we watched it. A good storyline which keeps you guessing, not very obvious either, with excellent acting and a sensational cast.
The only downside really was that the kid didn't get that big a part, when he could've been quite useful, and also Daniel Craig's accent was a complete and utter joke, the worst part of the film.
Overall really good, I'd watch again, even if that would mainly be for Chris Evans in a cable knit sweater."
2091,"Was intrigued by this but as soon as I heard Daniel Craig's accent, I hit the stop button."
2092,This film was very dull. Struggled to find any good points to mention. Perhaps the one saving grace was Daniel Craig and his funny southern drawl.
2093,"It was a great movie with a wonderful and talented cast. I am very impressed, the plot was great."
2094,"This is just old-fashioned murder mystery but more original, complex and beter produced written directed well made"
2095,"The movie is really good and the immersive movie leaves you curious, you don't get bored anyway, I like the places, the colors, the dialogues, it has been a successful business in general, the cast is already per-fec-t!"
2096,"So this is what an American version of Agatha Christie would look like. As entertaining as the already dreadful US TV version ""The Murder She Wrote"". Yes, not good as even that.It is full of talented actors - no doubt - yet, even each and every one of them cannot make this interesting. I do not mind 'over-the-top' Agatha Christie style movies. To that point, 2017's 'Murder on the Orient Express' by Kenneth Branagh was highly entertaining. I cannot put the finger on why exactly THIS one does 'not work'.The only highlight is watching Ana de Armas on screen. Alone or together with Christopher Plummer, or her mother (Marlene Forte) & sister. For a moment, you suddenly care about somebody."
2097,"Knives Out is a mystery movie. I downloaded it because 90% of google users like the film, that's why I wonder whether the movie is good or bad. In the midway of watching the movie, I observed some confusing twist and I never understand what's the story all about."
2098,Definitely a one time watch and a very interesting one. Loved the different characters.
2099,"The majority of humour in this movie was quite dark and/or literal. So you have to have a warped sense of humour to really appreciate how funny, and well done this film is. I loved it. Laughed the entire way through! Cast were amazing, dialogue was incredible. Definitely on my favourites list."
2100,Can add to must-watch list cause the whole movie went smoothly. Can't stop to watch for audiences. Chris Evans is my favor!
2101,What a brilliant piece of movie making! Amazingly refreshing!
2102,"Many of the old classics are outdated by today's fast paced environment. While I still love murder on the orient express from the 70's, that version is so slow compared to this.This, is very fresh, in a sense that not only it's tightly written, as in I can believe the plot is plausible, but it' also well acted. Pacing is fast, while retaining some basic humor and nods to the classics.Most importantly, the story while wasn't original, also had enough elements to make you guessing.I would say, there is nothing better out there for a new take on a detective story. Are there darker options? Yes. are there grittier options? Yes. Are there much more serious and mood setting options? yes., of course. But, for a family evening, there is no better 'who done it' story."
2103,Didn't give 10 star because of a slow start of the movie. But I get the intention of it was to build up the plot and make it as mysterious as possible.
2104,"If anyone is looking for a ""believable"" whodunit this is not for you. But that takes NOTHING away from how entertaining and unpredictable this movie is. I saw the ad in theaters and thought it looked corny but after a few friends gave me the nudge I watched it and was very impressed. The characters are all very hyperbolic and the situations are pretty unrealistic but the framing and tone of this movie makes it fit very well! In an era where it seems like realism is what all movies are measured by it was refreshing to see Rian Johnson wash the taste of TLJ out of our mouths with a witty, well made, Clue-esque mystery that remains engaging and unpredictable all the way through. If Rian Johnson published this under a pseudonym this would be an easy 8-9/10."
2105,"Great movie!
Comedy and lots of suspense!
Superb all-star cast!"
2106,"This movie is a classic, with some twists that keep it fresh. The shameless greed of the family, the young underdog protagonist, the detective who seems a little bit in love with his own process ... a lot of fun to watch. Playful with the detective movie genre, without actually breaking it."
2107,"At least quarantine has given me the chance to catch up on movies I've missed like 'Knives Out'.This movie has an incredible star-studded cast with spectacular performances across the board. Standouts include Daniel Craig and his Kentucky accent, Chris Evans telling people to eat sh**, and Ana de Armas with easily the best performance in the movie. Not only does Rian Johnson do a great job with directing this movie, but an even better job writing it.However, the movie mistakenly goes against the murder-mystery formula. We're given too much information too early, which makes the last half of the movie less interesting. The point of a murder-mystery is to play ""detective"", analyze the characters and see if you can figure out whodunnit, but this was spoiled for us too early. Even still, this was a clever, well thought out movie with great characters and a fun storyline.Score: 7 out of 10Recommended for: Fans of murder-mysteries, fans of Rian Johnson subverting your expectations, or fans of Captain America telling you to eat sh**."
2108,A whodunit where the killer is revealed before the 40 minute mark but it still keeps you guessing until the end. Well written and with a great cast this is a solid murder mystery and worth repeat viewings.
2109,"Fantastic film great who done it with humour and gripping acting helps to have a great cast and they have got it in this film, please watch it youl enjoy, also a lot of aaaaa i seeeee 🤔"
2110,"Rian Johnson is very suited for this film with all his twists and subversion of expectations. I love films with mysteries and this film has it in spades. Even when you think you know what's going on, this film has more new twists to throw at you. The characters were all true to life and very well acted. I loved it."
2111,Knives Out has a very well written script with twists and turns galore with a mystery so mindbending and complex you'll be scratching your head in some scenes. Ana de Armas plays a great role as the main protagonist with Chris Evans pulling off a great performance aswell.The film is shot mostly on a wealthy man's house with interior shots that are very well directed and crisp looking. Overall a very fun time with Knives Out and I definitely recommend you go see it
2112,"A film that is both orthodox and talks about immigration issues(There's a spoiler about the immigration issue at the bottom.)The structure of the work itself is similar to the suspense mysteries of the past and there is not much unexpectedness. However, it was quite interesting with an overwhelmingly interesting script and direction.I thought it was just an Hercule Poirot type of detective trying to solve a crime in a straightforward manner, but it's not, at the beginning They put a big twist on it early on, and the genre itself doesn't change as much as a Korean film does. It doesn't have one, but while it fits within the genre, it takes a turn that goes beyond expectations. These interesting and unique developments are typical of Ryan Johnson.And often interrupted are the humorous descriptions. There are some funny scenes such as bickering between family members and ugly fight. It's a very funny movie with the usual mystery direction and the setting of the house where the police inspector and the detective It's also interesting to tweak the target. I also enjoyed the slapstick of Marta, played by Anade Armas.The symbolic setting of the house and the other locations are not included in the film. As a stage play suspense mystery, this film is a classic, but interesting. It has the essence of a royal road, but the script has an unexpected twist to make it an entertaining work. The quality around the completion of the film is great.I can't talk about it in detail because it's basically a spoiler-free movie. You should go see it.As for the cast, Klieva is out of character by all accounts, and it's a big difference from what happened with Cap. She's at her best in the role. The rest of the cast is also gorgeous. Anade Armas is still a beauty.
I heard Joseph Gordon Levitt was in it, but where was he!Spoilers below on the immigration issueIt was also interesting to see how they've been able to include contemporary American issues as a major theme in this story. That is that the nurse, Ana de Armas, is an illegal immigrant. This is a certainty, as there is a scene where the family has a political debate about illegal immigration.This family compound is a metaphor for ""America"". And Marta, a nurse, is described as having been ""hired directly without the Visiting Nurse Association"". In other words, it is a metaphor for illegal immigrants who ""came directly to the country without formal registration with the state"".The film turns out that Marta was not the culprit, but one of her family members was. In other words, the U.S. is fostering and strangling the illegal immigration problem by the American people themselves. That's what I'm saying. This is a fact, and illegal immigrants coming from Mexico are coming from three Central American countries with their children. Most of them are family members.Illegal immigrants are blamed for the deterioration of security and other factors in that country, but it is their own The gang (MS-13) that was created in the United States as a result of interference in the civil war in El Salvador (MS-13), as It is the United States that has deported them. In other words, illegal immigration in the United States is the result of self-inflicted wounds.In the scene where he left all of his inheritance to Marta, the family members insisted that Marta was just like family. Falsely, he instantly changes his attitude and reveals his anger. This is a metaphor for Trump and his supporters, who claim to be America First It is the anti-immigration movement itself. Also, the fact that the youngest boy in the family is a ne'er-do-well in the United States today, mainly on the internet. The result of the Charlottesville incident is the growing number of ""alternative right-wingers"" on the .In the end, the scene where Marta looks down on the evicted family from the second floor is wonderfully poignant. The words ""MY HOUSE"" on the glass. That's how America calls itself an external enemy, playing into Trump's populism and looking inward (government). I guess he's saying that before you know it, you'll collapse from the inside out and you'll be ostracized. The ""inside"" in the play is not only about the incident, but also about the affair and the business problem of the second son. Or maybe it's the issue of tuition for Joni and her daughter, played by Toni Collette.In this way, the entire story talks about the issue of immigration. This is exactly the kind of politics that are inextricably linked to the royal mystery suspense while being inextricably attached to the royal mystery suspense. It's great that it also talks about the theme of the film. This one is a no-brainer for Best Screenplay Oscar. It's too good.Translated with DeepL Translator (free version)"
2113,"The most Agatha part of the whole story is not the repetition of reasoning and reversal, but the good people are tested and the good people win safely in the end, and the good heart from beginning to end."
2114,A fun who-done-it that does a good job of keeping you guessing. A fantastic cast that delivers on expectations. The twists are exciting and well written. A very enjoyable film.
2115,"Pros:Trademark murder mystery, there certainly isn't enough of them around. Rian Johnson did a superb job with thisSet design was impeccableEnsemble cast were phenomenal. Special shout out to Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig (who will both appear in the new Bond film)Unique film has it reignited the murder mystery sub-genreCons:Perhaps some parts of the film were predictableOverall, I really had a good time with 'Knives Out'. As I mentioned earlier, Rian Johnson deserves a lot of credit for tackling a film that has the narrative that a murder mystery involves. We've rarely seen a murder mystery film in recent with as much quality and style that 'Knives Out' shows so well done to Rian. The ensemble cast undoubtedly shine through as virtually all cast members play their part very well. Yes, some parts may have appeared predictable but all in all, 'Knives Out' was a great watch, especially one to watch with the family or friends!Quote - ""I suspect foul play"" - Benoit BlancScore - 8/10"
2116,Wow unimaginable thriller detective movie. Daniel Craig as detective & Chris Evans in negative shade what a combo to watch. The screenplay was unique and suspense filled. Iy also teaches families values and importance than wealth. Good movie to enjoy.
2117,"I've watched this 3 times and every time i discover something new. the way it's shot, the set design, the wardrobe of the characters and the mystery; everything is so well done and so enjoyable. love this movie"
2118,"A beautiful thriller to start with Daniel & Chris as opposite. Wow, thats sounds amazing.
Plot is perfect as well as the way of execution. Got more than what i expected and fully satisfied. Great fillm!"
2119,This movie passed my expectations heart warming and bone chilling anyone would like this movie.
2120,Very good who done it movie. Twists and turns throughout to keep you guessing til the end. If mysteries are your thing this is your movie.
2121,"Impeccable actors, an engaging story and very well told. This results in a wonderful and delicious movie to watch."
2122,"If you like movies with mysteries, this crime movie is perfect for you. The actors do very well in their roles, and that in this film is very important. You think one thing throughout the movie, but at the end of the movie, there's something completely different going on."
2123,"A bit of a slow start, but turned out to be very entertaining. Probably the best murder/mystery I've ever watched."
2124,The movie was fantastic.. there were just 2 to 3 charachters were useless. Otherwise movie is just awesome
2125,"If you've ever read any mistery/crime book written by Agatha Christie, you will love this movie. Nothing was wrong with it. Perfect acting (specially Daniel Craig's performance), it leaves you at the edge the whole time. Lots of twists. The first 30 minutes with the several interviews is brilliant. The mansion has a wonderful dark atmosphere, specially when some characters tell their side of the story in off. One of the best movies of 2019."
2126,"Rian Johnson recovers from his big yet bad movie you may have heard of, 'the Last Jedi,' to add his own twist to the modern whodunit genre with this very clever and well made movie.'Knives Out' tells the story of a wealthy mystery-writer's mysterious death, his eccentric family, the writer's nurse (Ana de Armas), and a detective (Daniel Craig), trying to piece it all together.The movie comes with unexpected twists and turns, good acting, and solid directing from Johnson which put all together makes this a movie I'd be glad to see again."
2127,"Loved every second of this movie! Watched it 3 times now. I RARELY rewatch a movie, this one's different."
2128,"Colorful Murder Mystery comedy that Utilizes a star studded cast performing in ensemble. Like a Murder on the Orient Express genre we are amazed at the ham acting the only seasoned professionals can achieve and keep our interest. The arts and costumes are stimulating and the historical depiction manages a diverse cast of characters. traditional Hollywood at its best and appreciated by China audiences. If you go to to the Cinema 5 times per year, include Knives Out"
2129,"Definitely not what I expected going in but I'm so glad I kept my mind open! All actors did great, and Daniel Craig Certainly did not disappoint. I'm a fan of mystery novels and movies and this one takes turns that had me guessing until the end."
2130,"Detective, comedy, thriller. The film was directed by Ryan Johnson, who shot a mega shelter called Star Wars: The Last Jedi, but also made a script here. Well, to begin with, I was not going to look at this picture at all, but the circumstances turned in such an unexpected way that I had to remember it and look in good company - and it was really hilarious and cool! I really regretted that at one time I did not go to this picture in the cinema, since my impressions would be definitely stronger. And here is my brief opinion - a hilarious American detective with English charm. I admit honestly that when I watched I tried to notice not only the pros, but also the minuses, and if everything was too obvious with the first ones, then a small flip came out with the second. Except for a few technical and scenario points, as such, there are no minuses from the word at all. It may be a matter of my general impression, it may be a matter of my carelessness, but it is. Therefore, I will dwell in more detail on the advantages of this detective, which sincerely pleased your humble servant!
So here they are:
1. A detective story - the plot is simple - in a large country house, after a noisy party, the patriarch of the family was found dead. All the signs indicate suicide, but the arriving detectives begin to suspect something was wrong when they get to know the relatives of the deceased better, they behave suspiciously. Envy, money hunting, political games, intrigues reign in the family. A first-class private detective intervenes in the matter, having a reputation as a person who always ""gets to the bottom of the truth."" Suicide or not? The circle of suspects is pretty obvious, motives? Inheritance, intrigue, personal dislike? When our company watched this picture, it was interesting to speculate, pay attention to small details, and feel the atmosphere. We'll talk about the final below, but the investigation itself, the disclosure of the characters is at a high level. The picture really holds in suspense, forcing the viewer to move gyrus. If you are a fan of detective stories and want to see something fresh from this genre - this picture is definitely for you!
2. Entourage - as for the environment, the situation, the general mood - everything is at the highest level. It turned out a kind of Agatha Christie in modern times, with her gadgets, achievements, actual problems, but with the classic and eternal problems of the relationship of fathers and children. In terms of surroundings, this picture strongly resembles the ""Murder in the Orient Express"" of 2017. The house itself looks modern, but from it it stretches from the nineteenth century. Furnishings, costumes, decorations - lovers of aesthetics will definitely like the picture!
3. Humor is a comedy, this is the second genre of this picture, and it is felt and seen from the very beginning. At first, I even thought that it would be a whole comedy with a fax at the end, something like a ""dog's sleep,"" especially since there were a lot of hints in this direction - no. Humor here dilutes the tense detective when we, together with a private investigator, try to find out the truth - and it works great here!
4. Music - I cannot but note atmospheric music, which perfectly conveys the mood and the very spirit of this picture. This, again, is a mixture of the classic detective and modernity, with its tunes and rhythms. Although in isolation from the picture, music loses all its charm. But I will praise the composer (Nathan Johnson).
5. Final - the picture plays ""cat and mouse"" with the viewer, trying to confuse the latter, throwing in and focusing on seemingly insignificant things and events, leading the viewer on the wrong track and making the final for him truly unexpected . I will say this, my version was confirmed, though I did not expect that the killer and motive would turn out that way ... oh sorry, but I won't tell you that. Indeed, the charm of detectives is that the viewer would participate in the investigation process. I went this way - and got the result. And what will be your path? Only you will know the answer! See for yourself and get your portion of pleasure!
A little about the main characters:
1. Harlan Tromby, performed by Christopher Plummer, is the patriarch of the large Tromby family, holding all the capital in his hands. An eccentric old man who, with his antics, will make you laugh, be surprised, and maybe even think about some issues. The charismatic Christopher magnificently embodied the image of an eccentric old man on the big screen, and his costumes - in general, will fly away and have an excellent style. Bravo Christopher!
2. Benoit Blanca performed by Daniel Craig is a first-class private detective who has been paid so much that now he is simply obliged to open this case and bring the villain into clean water. Restrained, damn smart, a good psychologist and a real gentleman, always dressed with a needle. What can I say, I don't like James Bond, especially in the performance of Craig, but here I was even curious how ""Mr. Brutality 2006"" to cope with such a role where you need to think more and not break limbs to all adversaries. And what is the result? But he did it. It was praise, Daniel, but don't relax, you are still on my list of hate, keep trying, then you will be a good boy and a good nyasha!
I will not represent the rest of the heroes, so as not to spoil your impression and pleasure.
Judging by the fees and news, we are waiting for the continuation. Well, if about Mr. Blanc's new business, then he'll do it, because the main story is over. Will I wait for him? Sure. Very interested!
As a result, we have a hilarious detective with excellent surroundings, an exciting story with sharp turns, excellent atmospheric music and excellent acting!"
2131,"Watched this movie a couple of days back, and am compelled to react. Was it perfect? Hell no, especially the twang in Mr Craig's put on southern accent did jar (at times). But the easy pace of the script , devoid of any jump cuts and adrenaline doses, was immensely enjoyable.It was so refreshing to watch a mainstream Hollywood production telling a story solely dependent on histrionics and the camera, and not on colossal set pieces and car (or any other mode of transportation) chases. Please make no mistake, I enjoy a a car chase and set piece just as much as the next guy, being an avid SciFi and comic book movie fan I would be a hypocrite to state otherwise. But of late that's all that was being served from the mainstream stock. Although it did have a car chase but it was virtually non existent and was important in the greater scheme of things.The talent involved both in front and behind the camera were of supreme brilliance. All in all a refreshingly nostalgic mode of story telling. I would refer this movie to all cinephiles.I can't say anymore without going into the spoiler zone. I scored it 8/10 on IMDb, maybe 7.5 would be more apt. But what the hey..."
2132,"'Knives Out' (2019) is a mystery drama with some elements of a thriller, which was directed by Rian Johnson. The script was also written by Rian Johnson. The actors who played their roles are Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Shannon, Don Johnson among others.The plot reveals mutual relations in the family of an author of detective novels. By writing them, he made his fortune. As a result of his finance, wealth interest his family members. Every one of his relatives has their own reasons. The events in the movie are disclosed steadily, telling the story of every character, their conflicts and mutual relations between every member of the family.The movie received several nominations. I wish also positively to acknowledge the acting of Daniel Craig and Jamie Lee Curtis. You will probably like this movie if you are fan of detective novels and movies. 'Knives Out' is a great one.Written by Anastasiia Shystovska"
2133,What i loved most about this movie was the ending.i would have never seen that coming.watch it rn!!
2134,Have to admit I waited a long time to see this and I was not let down. The cast is absolutely amazing at what they do and I would say this will be a career high for Daniel Craig as he plays his detective character very well. My only reason for not giving the full 10 is I found it obvious who committed the crime from the start. Apart from that it's fantastic.
2135,"This movie is so good I watched it twice. It was just as good (or better, if that is possible) the second time."
2136,"Loved this film! From the cast, editing and the storyline - it was all perfect. A must watch."
2137,How does this only have a 7.9. This is film is practically perfect. Super smart and entertaining. Way underrated.
2138,"You have to focus .
That's it .

2139,"Mildly entertaining and beautifully done. Great cast, beautiful decors."
2140,"Excellent movie, with great performance of all actors, this one is one of my favorite movies so far!
I enjoy every second of it!"
2141,"Such a fun movie! The cast was fantastic. I was kept guessing all the way through - the twist at the end was amazingly done. I loved it, did not want it to end."
2142,"Detective movies tend to feel like a replay after a while, as most of them follow certain repeatable patterns that inevitably lead to the conclusion and the solution to the grand mystery. But this one differentiates itself as the story is unique to its conception. Add to that a perfect blend of a catchy score, a brilliant cast and a very beautiful direction by Rian Johnson.
This is a must watch. 9/10."
2143,"I saw Knives Out as a suggestion from a friend, despite I don't prefer comedies and I am really glad I gave this movie a chance. Not only the amazing performance of Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc who was adorable, clever and really funny, but also the insane cleudo-like feeling on a story that seems predictable but it really isn't, made this movie a great satisfying experience. By using, great performances, clever conection of incidents and well-placed comedy, Rian Johnson delivers an intresting ""find the murderer""-story that will not only keep the interest of the viewer but will also make him laugh and feel entertained. Amazing job by both the cast and the director, seems a little bit simplistic mostly on secondary characters and the whole research thing but gives such a great time to everyone that in the end, it doesn't even matter. A great comedy you can enjoy either with company or alone due to the light-hearted storyline and general essence."
2144,"I'm so happy a movie like this can still get made in today's Hollywood. A taught little, escapist murder mystery, told remarkably well. And all without lots of violence or gore (one little exception noted). Great performances all around. Sure it's somewhere between Clue and Agatha Christie but who cares! It doesn't . It references Clue explicitly and Jessica Fletcher makes a cameo. Just enjoy! I haven't watched the last few Bond flicks, but I might the next just to see if Daniel Craig's and Ana de Armas's easy 'Knives Out' chemistry comes through in a completely different kind of movie. Hopefully they'll share a bit of screen time again."
2145,"I loved the cast and the twist in the movie, but it felt like i was watching Murder on the orient express again."
2146,I watched 2 times and still laugh. Reviewers complained about Daniel's accent but why so bother?
2147,"Wasn't bad, but wish it was slightly more like Clue."
2148,"If you enjoy good whodunnits, you'll like this movie. It plays around with the concept and adds its own unique twist to it. The acting is also phenomenal, and there are some important political messages woven within too."
2149,"Seems the negative reviews on here fall into three categories: It was boring, It wasn't a whodunnit, and white tears.I can agree with the first two..
The film is longer than it needs to be and could have been cut down to an hour and a half without losing much. It also isn't really a whodunnit so don't go into it with that mindset.
But if you're still interested, it has beautiful cinematography, quirky characters, and a good dose of tongue in cheek humor."
2150,"Well to say the least this is the first movie I watched which made me feel that it should finish quickly I can't wait for 2 hours for this,but in an entirely different way"
2151,"Knives Out had Rian Johnson's hand all over it! He directed, produced, and wrote the film, just coming off of Star Wars: The Last Jedi, that was pretty controversial, but bounced back very well with a definitive mystery classic. Not only did he create one of the best mysterys to come to the big screen, but he was able to incorporate all of the enjoyable genres like crime, drama, thriller, & comedy. Johnson painted these beautiful frames, adding so much depth to his shots. With shooting in detail, rather than in film, it added a lot of depth to every scene, while utilizing the natural light that was provided.Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job modernizing the murder mystery/who did it tale, and really making it his own. The screenplay was coherent & fresh, being so witty, sharp & hilarious. He created this crystal clear narrative, backed up with so much wit, and style, it made you overlook all the simplicities. The few subplots this film had, it added amazing layers & depth, while it all intertwined with the big picture so well, enhancing this great mystery tale. The tone switch ups this film had was incredible! The tone switched up every half hour or so, keeping us on our toes, but explaining everything in depth, while keeping it as entertaining as possible.Mary Vernieu casted easily the best cast of 2019 so far. Knives Out was chock-full of A-list actors like Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis & more! Everyone knew their place, and played their roles the best they could've. Christopher Plummer put on such a mature & witty performance, arguably being one of the funniest of the group. Daniel Craig was one of my favorite castings for this movie. His performance was very witty, and clever, mixed with great tongue & cheek jokes. Craig may not have been the main protagonist we follow, but he is most certainly one of the best performers in this movie! Ana de Armas was our sweet ""innocent"" main protagonist. We follow her for most of the film, and my god, does she put on a GREAT performance! Chris Evans has been more focused on playing a cool headed, heroic character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but here he puts on a devious, sarcastically funny, yet charming & persuasive character. We got a little taste of him in the first act, but not as much as the other supporting characters. Evans becomes more present in the second and third act, adding a different flare to this unique family. Rian Johnson created great tention with all of the characters, throwing in nifty twists, keeping everyone involved, and relevant.
The art directors & production designers in David Crank & David Celestenger created this beautiful, old time mansion. The way Rian Johnson executed the mansion was fantastic, making everything feel free, yet claustrophobic, while rising the stakes.Overall, I can easily say this is my favorite mystery movie, even over Sherlock Holmes; Highly recommended."
2152,"Knives is a methaphore of murdered, everyone that's being interrogated by the investigator is sitting on the chair which surrounded by knives. However, the knives is never out until the real murdered shows up, and put it on another victim. I appreciate the process or the case of the murder because at some point it makes me think of another way of ending. What if, harlan just died with case of suiside, or what if there's another plot twist that could happen like martha could just setting up this whole situation. Haha, very interesting and very good cinematography.."
2153,A smooth easygoing movie. It will get you hooked till the very end of it. Simply one of the best movies in the last 20 years.
2154,"Starts slow and insignificant but picks up when ACT II begins with Ana de Armas - the upcoming actress did a fantastic job for the role. As of today, a good mystery film has become a lost pearl, this film is definitely a gem with some ingenuity. The resolution is predictable, but still wrapping in a good sense of wit. But besides of some cheesy tricks, like ""you"" & ""hugh"", I also found that the film lacks the character's development, as most characters (Jamie Lee Curtis, e.g.) are fell to the background the whole time (which is opposite the fundamental theory of Whodunnit) except Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas, and Chris Evans. Even Daniel Craig appears subdued and monochromatic. But nevertheless, it's still entertaining, especially for Ana's can't-miss performance, so I strongly recommend it."
2155,I was delighted and surprised at the same time. Loved every bit.
2156,If you want to watch a good mystery movie I recommend it
2157,"First off, Daniel Craig's character is awesome I think. This movie is just so much fun and has serious re-watch value. I've watched it 3 times in the last week and keep picking up on cleverly added details that I missed the times previous.The writing is top-notch, the acting is top-notch, and the characters are fantastic and hilarious and believable all at the same time.The only reason I didn't rate this a 10/10 is because I think it had too much language. I'm not a fan of language in movies, but this one had a lot for PG-13 I thought.That being said, I can't wait for the next one to come out and I will probably see this movie many more times before it does!This is also the first review I've written for a movie - I think it's that good."
2158,"An indeed fresh take in Murder Mystery sub-genre, that states itself in quality and near perfect execution. Rian Johnson as the director did a phenomenal job of making sure that every piece falls into its desired place. A well constructed writing, with some clever bits and pieces given here and there in order to tease the viewer; it certainly showcases its true merit in that regard. It makes us guess the actual culprit several times, it makes us confuse more with every new incident. Even though the revelation at the end wasn't totally surprising but the sheer amount of excellence in the build up alone could provide the much needed satisfaction. And I must point out the cumulative blend of Comedy and Suspense here; as the balance has been done tremendously well. They never crosses each others path and stays in their own territories. I liked that. Cinematography, Sound Design both pay homage to Vintage movies. The nostalgic locations somehow finds its similarities with classic cinemas that belonged from the same genre. Performances are outright brilliant. Each one of the characters have done justice to their respective roles. Special Mention must go to Daniel Craig, Ana de Armas and Chris Evans as they were truly the driving force behind.
Some political ideologies have also been talked about although they didn't portray much importance in here in terms of the storyline but surely showcased Different viewpoints in an interesting presentation nonetheless. In the end, It's a Well Directed, Brilliantly Written and Impressively Acted film that deserves more viewership. I would surely encourage you to do the same."
2159,"Most shocking conclusion: Jamie Lee smoked!!Sorry if that gave away a bit too much, but in reality, it was so minor to the story, I'm shocked it was even included. In real life, however, this is everything. See, Jamie Lee Curtis is so against smoking, she once said that anyone who chooses to smoke doesn't deserve medical insurance.I used to smoke, for 22 years. Been clean for 2 years and 3 months tomorrow. But, when I heard her say this, I was smoking and was pissed that she obviously didn't understand addiction. And then...it all came out about HER addiction. Not to nicotine, but something else. No...not yogurt. So, maybe this was her way of saying she understands and her earlier statement is wrong.I digress. This whodunit with so many incredible actors - yes, including Jamie Lee, whom I do love, was equally wonderful. I love this kind of quirky mystery and they don't make 'em like they used to.I went into this so cold, I barely knew 5% of this film. I felt and was right about the theme and mood. But the twists and how it would play out: a complete mystery to me. And should be to you, as well.Relish in great acting, tongue in cheek atmosphere and just have fun trying to solve it yourself as I did and then find yourself completely wrong. Yes, watch yourself get so tied up and think it's so obvious, you'll be pleasantly surprised.Also, it's not a Clue remake. I thought it was when it was announced and when the trailers came out. I mean, I guess it COULD be an homage to the movie/board game Clue, but it's not. Enjoy it for the fun, funny and mystery it is.***Final thoughts: On my one and only cruise, last day, before we were debarking, I was in the elevator to get the level where I could go out and smoke. (See? I used to, back then anyways.) I saw a woman traveling with me in the lift and I was floored. It WAS Jamie Lee Curtis, I swore to myself. When I did a double/triple take with her, she smiled at me as if she knew I knew it was her. Anyways, she ended up at the same place as I was at: the outdoor smoking deck and she smoked. It was right then and there I knew: it couldn't be her. She was so anti-smoking, this couldn't be the real Jamie Lee.Now, after watching this movie...the case has officially been reopened."
2160,"Like Agatha's mysteries, so intriguing! Some of Sherlock's humor...Bright colors and cuteness of brown eyed brunette like Amelie...Well frickin done!"
2161,"Without spoiling the movie, let me just tell you that it does not follow the typical whodunnit forrmula, while still being an exciting mystery. Each character is an amusing caricature. And the scenery was so incredibly detailed, you sometimes miss the movie!"

2163,"Written and Directed by Rian Johnson, Knives out is 2019 film starring an assemble cast including Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc, a world-famous private investigator. Lakeith Stanfield as Detective Lieutenant Elliott, A local police detective, and Christopher Plummer as Harlan Thrombey, a wealthy mystery writer and the family patriarch. The film follows the Thrombey family as they are interviewed by Elliot and Blanc who are searching for Harlan's murderer after he is found dead the morning after his 85th birthday party. The films overall theme is that of having being kind in a world that is cruel. We see this through Marta Cabrera, Harlan's nurse, played by Ana de Armas. Marta is presented as innocent and honest. She even has a medical condition which makes it impossible for her to lie without becoming violently ill. This innocence is so endearing that viewer continues to root for her in the third act of the film after her actions are revealed alongside the other family members.Viewers will likely see similarities between Knives Out and other classic murder mystery movies such as Clue and Murder on the Orient express. The films unique use of editing and framing set it apart and make it a worthy modern take on the genre. Rian Johnson routinely frames his shots with a Wes Anderson level of reverence for symmetry. This used particularly well in interview scenes where Elliot and Blanc are speaking to a single family member. This attention the shot composition and framing come to the forefront again in the way interviews are positions in front of a sculpture of large array of knives.The films editing and sound design takes advantage of flashbacks and voiceovers to tell its story. Elliot, Blanc, and other characters use voiceover to narrate what the audience is seeing in a flashback. As the story progresses, the audience is shown the same event from multiple perspectives. What appears normal in one person's flashback, is revealed in another person's to be part of a larger plot. As the movie reveals its plot twist and the twist upon that twist, these flashbacks paint a clear picture and allow the audience to solve the crime along side the detectives. The films climax and final reveal are extremely satisfying because this editing technique immerses the viewer and makes them feel involved in the investigation.Overall, knives out is an extremely fun movie with a familial theme that many movie goers can likely sympathize with. Rian Johnson did extremely well in this update to a genre that has seemingly fallen out of favor with large studios as of late."
2164,I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end! Loved it!!!
2165,This movie didn't have any plot holes that I can think of. It was written and acted very well. I really enjoy movies with a twist. Most times they scramble at the end to make it work sacrificing the quality of the story. This was not one of those movies.
2166,Interesting twist to with the story line and great cast
2167,Great movie! i was intrigued every second of it. the twists were unexpected and made the movie that much more interesting. the acting was spectacular and it was the best mystery I have ever watched. It's fun to watch again to see how the murderer covered up his crime. 10/10 recommend watching this movie with friends or family.
2168,"A wonderfully written comical suspenseful movie for all ages. Three generations of family members in our house loved it, in fact it was my 13 year old's idea."
2169,Watch the movie (preferably on a big screen) and then watch it again. It will make more sense the second time through.The script is great. The cast is solid but the house is the star of the film.Enjoy it for what it is - a movie that pays homage to the great whodunits of yesteryear.
2170,👏👏👏👏👏 five claps score. 10/10 that was a extremely well written murder mystery!
2171,"The trailer in the movie theater was absolutely delightful. I could not wait to see this film because of it. Unfortunately, I found the chemistry between the characters to be a bit empty and superficial. It's difficult to achieve depth of character with such a large cast, but regardless, they could have focused much more on character development and interaction. For one, Daniel Craig's accent really threw me off and just personally didn't like it much. His character development seemed strange to me, as if he were conveying being a little bit dumb and highly intelligent at the same time, which doesn't correspond well with his big Sherlock-style reveal at the end. I did find some things funny and was mildly entertained, but not nearly as intrigued or engaged as the trailer made me believe I would be. 7/10 for the general story, entertainment, some acting, but heavily lacking in making each character not feel so one-dimensional, in my opinion."
2172,A really great whodunnit. I enjoyed it for sure. My wife liked it even more which is pretty telling as well.
2173,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but it kept me guessing most of the movie. I didn't appreciate the swearing because I feel it takes away from movies, but it was great other than that. I didn't want to watch it when my daughter suggested it, but I enjoyed it."
2174,The cast and everyone of the crew did an amazing job. It really has you thinking and there so much happening (in a good way) and distracted you from coming to your own conclusion of who the killer is. It has you doubting everything and you will really be in shock in the end.
2175,"Wow. The first 2/3 of Knives Out is good, but the last 1/3 is the best I've seen this year. No spoilers here, so I will just say, even after all is revealed, the last 10 seconds might be my favorite part! Do yourself a favor and watch this movie."
2176,"Why are criminals good? Or ""Who done it"" stories in English? Because of the mystery in itself. Because of unknown, undiscovered cases, murders. Enough for these is a good basic story, a couple of exciting characters and an interesting venue. Although crime scenes are more present on television today, mainly due to the high-profile programs of the 90s and 2000s, let's not forget the classics either. Hercule Poirot comes to mind for everyone about Agatha Christie, not by chance. This is what Rian Johnson put into today's environment. The director says the film was inspired by the works of Agatha Christie, and it shows in it, its atmosphere is similar to the villa striking in the Ten Little Negroes. A big house full of secret doors. But even his figures are surrounded by the world of crime. The protagonist, who in this case is the victim, Harlan Trumbley (Christopher Plummer) is a crime writer, and his house is also full of references from his books. Or one of the detectives (Noan Segan) recalls the writer's works all the way like an obsessed fan.
Speaking of the characters, Johnson put together a brilliant guard. Chris Evans, as the grandson of his eyes, who sees through the selfishness of his family, provides a parade shaping. Linda Drysdale, Harlan's daughter, is shaped quite well by Jamie Lee Curtis. I felt a bit throughout the film as if the family was in his hands, not even the men being the directors. The film also features Don Johnson, who plays Linda Drysdale's husband, Richard. We can see Harlan's son, Walt, played by Michael Shanonn, who is the heir to the Trombley book publisher. Or the other grandson, Jacob, played by Jaeden Martell, known from AZ, as the grandson of a pampered oblique Nazi who embodies the trolls fiddling with his phone. He is one of the sources of humor in the film. The other, of course, was Evans played by Ransom. The great-grandmother also represents humor, K. Callan brings the typical senile grandmother, but it is her character who also has a role in loosening the screw. I left the main characters at the end of the list, Ana de Armas brings the innocent nurse captivatingly well; or maybe a certain ability helps him? Daniel Craig, as a private investigator, is an exciting mix of investigators he has met so far. It's reminiscent of Poirot and Holmes, but it has its own line of thought, a certain perforated donut metaphor through which we can get through the film. Chemistry works very well between the two of them. I wonder what they will produce in the next Bond movie.
The script is also worth a few words. The interrogation is structured in such a way that everyone tells what happened from their own point of view, and the work of the cameraman helps with this. This is the most ingenious thing about the nurse, where we can see a complete recollection during a toss of money and the relationship between Harlan and Marta is outlined. The dialogues are well structured and contain a great deal of information for the investigation, so we can also help resolve the matter. The film contains a lot of pop culture references, starting with television crimes such as Killer Lines. series where we can follow the adventures of writer Jessica Fletcher or have a look at the Circle. horror is. In addition to the solution mentioned above, the cinematography adds a lot of classic settings to the film. Such is the scene in the living room of the house when Mr. Blanc is sitting by the fireplace. The big totals shot from the house add the mystique to the whole story. Steve Yedlin's paintings evoke the atmosphere of a classic crime scene.
The roughest part is that family members all set themselves up as loving family members, but Johnson shows them to be selfish people, thus questioning their role in the family. So it's not even a real family, just a congregation of money-hungry, exploiters who aren't as sincere as they show themselves to be. I really liked this multiple change of perspective. In his films so far, Rian Johnson usually caricatures, reverses the elements and structure of the given genre. While this wasn't really the case with The Last Jedi, it's coming up here with new, exciting, fresh ideas that hold their place in the crime genre as well.
Overall, this film is the film of the year on the crime front and a must-see for Craig fans. For those who like crime, it is recommended that they get the film because who knows when we will get such a brilliant work within the genre again."
2177,The first thing of the movie is creating of story is very good. Much of the credit goes to direction of this flim and the story line is very good to hold your breath. Must watch this movie if you are seeking for thriller
2178,Excellent cast totally worth seeing & paying for prime!!!!❤👍👏👏👏👏 no spoilers need to see for yourselves!!
2179,"What can I say? The cast is incredibly talented, the plot is fantastic. Rian Johnson's direction is incredible. I highly recommend this,"
2180,"Thank you for this great movie and what a great cast, to the very end. Reminds me of when movies were great and this one is Top Shelf"
2181,"Packed in layers of classical tone, English comedy, political satire, and shiny bright cards, except that the core part of the donut is empty, and there is no reason to proceed to the critical moment. The thrill of the whole person suddenly realized . The deeper the puzzle is solved, the more the director's power and inability to counter-type is felt, and the audience is circled with similes that can no longer be clarified, so as to avoid the truth that is self-evident as long as a blood test."
2182,Definitely better then I thought it was gonna be even though it was praised a lot when it came out but even for a who done it movie that have been done to death and are pretty predictable this one is pretty original and it makes you feel kind of stupid when you don't see the twists and turns it was also pretty funny and people are now seeing that Rian Johnson is a good person and Won't be seen is last Jedi guy this was it my favourite movie of 2019 but still pretty good and enjoyable but my only big problem is if this is a movie you would be able to watch repededly it's kind of a that was really good watch once movie over time MABYE that will change still pretty good movie directing was pretty sweet actors were pretty sweet ending with that last shot makes you feel so good about how they got what they deserved strong recommendation
2183,Nice entertaining Friday night movie. Husband and I really enjoyed it!
2184,"OMG I couldn't believe how bad Daniel Craig's ""southern"" accent was. I couldn't get past his sad attempt at a southern accent. He needs to stick to his own accent. It almost ruined the movie for me. That said, it was a good story, nice twist, and otherwise very entertaining, thus the seven stars. If Craig had used his own accent it would have been far more enjoyable and I would have given it 9 or 10 stars."
2185,Great movie! Saw it in theaters and liked it so much that I bought the DVD. My husband loves the film as well. My teenager likes it as well. Definitely watch if you haven't seen. I hope they make a part 2.
2186,"I love mysteries and The Dame is one of my favorites. Plenty of intrigue, suspense, red herrings and the denouement at the end is classic.Only thing that detracts from an otherwise excellent tale is Daniel Craig - does not work for me here. He has worked too hard to play the Southern Sleuth, it comes across as unreal.The plot is a bit predictable too, but interesting nevertheless.Spend the time, quite a good return for value."
2187,"Once you get past Daniel Craig's dodgy Texan accent this film is an absolute blast. I really enjoyed this film! And who would have thought that Chris Evans' wearing a nice cream cable jumper would make me like him 😉The story is a simple one, there has been a death, we meet the family who are interviewed and a nurse who can not lie...no seriously she can't lie if she does well she is sick everywhere! Everyone has a reason to kill him and the events from the night of the murder unfold slowly. We find out quite early on from one point of view what happened that night, but is it the true story?It did remind me of an Agatha Christie type story, having the family in a room and each being accused of murder, finding out tidbits of the story, but mainly we follow the story of Marta, the nurse and Benoit Blanc, which is quite comical at times.This did not feel like 2 hours to me, it flew by, it was over before I knew it. I was laughing at the bitchiness of the family, what a load of Queens, Each person had a role and they all played it well, it truly was some awesome acting!I would love to see a series on Blanc! He is so fascinating to watch and he does remind me of my favourite Belgium detective. Definitely a fun one to watch!"
2188,"At last a movie funny, entertaining and enjoyable. Loved the characters, very interesting."
2189,Figuring out who the villain is wasnt that difficult. suspense was lost.
2190,"Someone spoiled this movie on twitter, that's why I'm late watching it. But I'm still surprised with the ending."
2191,"I enjoyed this movie but I must say, having read many Agatha Christie novels, I spotted the two decisive clues that brings all together, which spoiled me a little the movie. Otherwise, great casting, funny camera angles, witty dialogues."

2193,"I have seen the movie twice in German. And once in French. Great actors, clever script, masterpiece."
2194,"All star cast in an amazing film about the possible murder of very rich Patriarch, who also likes to play games with his relatives, who plot and scheme against each other in an effort to gain the most from his Will."
2195,"What I loved most about this movie is its tiny unpredictable twists. Unlike some movies that have one FINAL TWIST at the end...(don't get me wrong...this did have a final big twist) but, the movie also sprung several small ones throughout. If you didn't notice the small twist, turns and references...you might want to watch it again.
Craig's portrayal of a sleuth detective is believable. The main female lead has a quirky, but loveable, disadvantage. And in my opinion, every single family member has some ""idiosyncrasy"" that makes you want to (metaphorically) slap them; at one point or another.
There's some slapstick humor that sometimes makes you want to smack your forehead. But best of all, when the big reveal happens, all the puzzle pieces fall right in to place.This movie was face-paced, witty, sarcastic, obnoxious, hilarious, endearing, infuriating, and yet...almost relatable.
I would watch it again."
2196,"I ave not seen a good movie in a time. My genre is mystery so I ave it a sot, and it was wort it. Especially, Daniel is te real em is move."
2197,"Here's The Lowedown on ""Knives Out"" (R - 2019 - Blu)Genre: Comedy/Suspense
My Score: 9.3Cast=10 Acting=9 Plot=10 Ending=10 Story=10
Funny=8 Chemistry=9 Script=10 Suspense=8 Twist=9A detective investigates the death of a patriarch of an eccentric, combative family.""Physical evidence can tell a clear story with a forked tongue."" This movie was like a cheesecake...at first glance, it doesn't look like much. You cut a slice and put it on your plate...it doesn't seem like one slice will fill you up. Then you get your first taste...and you realize the richness it has as you slowly chew. Like a cheesecake, this was slow moving, rich, filling, and you will go back for another slice. I loved this film...my first 9 this year!"
2198,Suspense drama needs strong logicality. This movie has done this. I've been amazed by the reversal and then reversal
2199,It was good and surprised me. in the middle of film you think it's over but slowly it show you some fact to understand you know nothing! it's good as a mystery film with good acting from the casts
2200,"This is an easy and witty suspense comedy. Compared with Agatha's British classic reasoning, this movie is not very brain-burning. Even the director basically presents the process of the case to the audience in the first 1/3 of the film, allowing the audience to appreciate the entire investigation process with God's perspective."
2201,"This movie is full of twists and turns. To the criticism of the reality problem, say the family changes heart in a moment, actually more or less can understand, if be oneself, if be that group of family also won't let go so easily. So when it comes to hearts, it's okay. There are also a few references to immigration in the movie, which seems to be beside the point. For me, the biggest revelation of this movie should be the character of the heroine. Integrity, courage, kindness. She is really kind ah, Fran finally died when she call the police really may be caught, will have nothing, but she still called the police, she is really kind ah."
2202,"Not much to say other than this movie is awesome. I wish more movies had this level of spunk and fun in the presentation. I love the use of old spooky house whodunit, and I would love to see more new movies done with this aesthetic in a modern setting like knives out. Dreamboat lieutenant elliott."
2203,"I thought it was just a normal detective movie and I thought it could have end within 40 minutes but in fact I was wrong, a very surprising movie!"
2204,"A well written film, that flowed and was purely enjoyable to watch."
2205,"It played with your mind.
Everything Little scenes and little scripted are well structured and well written. Every single Little things have meaning and connected to everything..
If you think it's boring at first... wait for it til the end and everything makes sense you won't regret!"
2206,"One of those rare movies /stories with no loop hole in the plot.Once You learn the truth at the end, you can review the whole plot and you ll find that it is air tight.
Great performances by actors.A Friday evening well spent. Totally worth your time."
2207,Good old fashioned who was it movie with some nice plot surprises and funny acting.
2208,"Really impressed with how well everyone is written in this movie. Everyone is distinct and don't get lost in standing out as the plot rolls on. Ana de Armas in particular shines the brightest in this film. A lot of the focus is on her and it is not waisted.This framing in just about every shot is wonderful. Especially with the character introduction scene, where cinematographer Steve Yedlin is able to use a great combination of close and wide shots to introduce Daniel Craig's character. As a side note; I really appreciated the climax of the film having that Hitchcockian dolly zoom. Nothing else, I was just geeking out that a modern movie used it in a smart way.I would say the unfortunate situation this film has against itself is that I fear it will have very little replay value. With some murder mysteries and ""who-dun-its"" you are encouraged to go back and pick up on details that you may not have noticed before you knew about the big reveal. Thinking back to the events of the film; I don't get that feeling. The reveal truly makes sense with information that is included in the very same scene. A good rewrite of Knives Out would include subtlety inserting details throughout that would encourage the audience to rethink how Christopher Plummer's character died.I do hope that the production team does not go unnoticed this award season. I'm not kidding when I say that the set design, costuming, etc. Is some of the best I have seen in quite some time. A special shoutout goes to the interior layout and set decoration of the Thrombey mansion .While I appreciate Rian Johnson subverting my expectations in a way that hopefully won't set the internet on fire, I did wish that the script allowed me to think for myself. Instead of just being amazed by the great set design, the awesome character writing, and a wonderful mix of score and licensed music."
2209,"This movie is a brave and confident creation. Such an old manslaughter mode, with the most classic and completely overused bridge sections, has been renovated to be so fascinating."
2210,"The director is still very good at this type of film. The rhythm is relaxed, and there are many characters without disorder. There are models, there are different kinds of commercial suspense films."
2211,"I like this movie very much, the plot and all the characters are very attractive to me, the whole time I was nervous to watch!"
2212,"The way the film progresses from a whodunnit, to Marta trying to get away with it, to the best plot twist villain I've seen in a long time, Ransom, being the ultimate murderer.I don't know how Rian Johnson went from The Last Jedi, to this masterpiece. But he did, and in the best way!"
2213,Amazing twist at the end worth watching the way the knife is fake and how she chose the wrong but right medication is amazing.
2214,"Always like that sentence - there are two things in the world can not be looked at, one is the sun, two is the heart.Therefore, never try to test human nature easily. Human nature is more complex than you imagine. Once you try, you will step into this abyss."
2215,"I would have given it 8 out of 10 if they had not gone with the overused ""Bluff about something and make the culprit admit to all his crimes."" As soon as her phone rang and it was the hospital, I knew exactly what they were going to do."
2216,"The killer could be anyone, we won't be surprised for that and the outcome turn out to be really an ""accident"", one of the reasons for the high evaluation of the movie is to satirize Trump's immigration policy, the immigrant was standing in the white's mansion, holding a cup of coffee cup written ""my house, my rule, my coffee"", how ironic that is!!!"
2217,"Worth a watch, well made and entertaining for a Friday evening"
2218,"""Knives Out"" just blew me away! It was dark, it was hilarious, and there were phenomenal performances from the whole cast, especially Daniel Craig and Chris Evans. While watching this movie, you will totally forget that this is the same Chris Evans who plays the heroic Captain America. This movie will just leave you speechless. It's a masterpiece and a must-see. Rian Johnson, I applaud you."
2219,"Fun, interesting, star studded movie! Even Daniel Craig's Foghorn Leghorn accent worked in this! The whole cast really shines in this, and I especially enjoyed Toni Collette's new age, dippy character! Good plot, good who-done-it, and really cool setting! And Ana de Armas, who plays Marta, really carries her character well! If you like murder mysteries, with the detective unveiling the whole plot at the end (a la Agatha Christie novels), then this is your kind of flick! Just please, after you watch it, please explain the doughnut comparisons!?!"
2220,"Thoroughly enjoyable, hilarious in places and was unpredictable in its outcome; all you need from a feel-good whodunnit!"
2221,"Brilleant acting, super film look, super suspance, can't guess, super twist"
2222,"Good plot twists, great casting , good script by man Daniel's accent ruined my mood at the start. Despite that I enjoyed the whole movie and stayed still during the whole case. Directing was really good, in favour of the actors. Maybe a smart script could make the sequel desire true!"
2223,"If you like who-dunnit type movies, you will enjoy this.
This is not an action movie with high-paced action scenes, so give this a skip if that is your vibe - go watch reruns of Fast & Furious rather.
If you want something to mentally engage you, with great cast and acting, keeping you thinking till the end - then watch this.
My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this."
2224,"In years I have not seen a well written whodunnit mystery as this one. It was smart to gather an ensemble cast mixture of different generations. The story was not predictable it kept you glued to the screen until you finally find out who is guilty. I am looking forward to the sequel and I hope it will be to the high standards of the original, keeping in mind the eclectic blend of great casting."
2225,"Out - movie review
A Black comedy murder mystery
December 17, 2019 EditorialGenre: Thriller Recommended: General Audience Released: 29 November 2019
Starring: Daniel Craig, Christopher Plummer, Chris Evans, Ana de Armas
Directed by: Rian JohnsonKnives Out poster
A successful author of mystery books is found dead in his attic study in mysterious circumstances with his throat slit right after his 85th birthday celebrations, leaving behind a big fat bank balance and estate and his quibbling family. Knives Out movie review...It looks like a suicide but someone does not seem to think so and mysteriously hires an eccentric ace detective to solve the death puzzle, the inquisition that follows a la Agatha Christie style points at every member of the family as suspect as each could have a motive and are lying through their rich pompous noses.There's the younger son who it seems has been fired by the old man and is unable to cope with it , the daughter's husband is playing Rasputin behind her back and the elder son's widow is skimming on the old man's generosity all in all everyone of them had had a run in with the old man just before celebrations.Each one of them has their reasons to be cross with him though they do try to portray a happy family picture, then there is the old man's pretty South American nurse who cannot digest lies and behaves very strangely at times which catches the eye of the detective Benoit Blanc, Daniel Craig's character with an elaborate drawl and puffed cheeks, looks as if he is trying hard to shake off his Bond image though his handsomeness fails him.Knives Out is a story which is tightly framed within the confines of the scenic locale of the death perceived murder and a few outdoor shots.Though the cat is out of the bag before the interval if you have the intellect. The detective is also shown doing his investigation in a bumbling manner as if giving full chance to the perpetrator to escape and basing his deductions more on the conversations during inquisition and background checks rather than the usual crime scene physicalities .But... but... but all things have to come out in a way so that all's well and that ends well in the end. Is it a murder, is it suicide or is it a true tribute to our beloved old dame Agatha, the jury or shall we say the knives are still out"
2226,"Saying only that it is interesting would not Be fair to the excellence of this movie. It is awesome and here is why.
1. There is nothing typical in this movie. Its not a old fashioned spy movie but an excellent portrayal of a great script.2.it starts slow 🐢, but gradually when you get familiar with characters it becomes catchy. Characters are strong built and do their part surprisingly good.3. Mid way through the movie the plot twists and it seeems like there is nothing left in this movie yo see but slowly in the end , boom there is surprise!So all in all, its a must watch for all viewers.
Go for it enjoy the uniqueness of this masterpiece."
2227,"What a joyous romp! Twists and turns, and just like any good Christie novel, everyone is a suspect!Great performances from a spectacular cast!"
2228,"Let me talk about the filming method first. The film is shown to the audience in the 1990s of the United States, like Renoir 's color painting. The whole article presents the audience with gray, zongzi warm tones. Using this realistic style, To give the audience real credibility and know that the paintings are created with oil paint and canvas, just like the logical reasoning of the film, knowing that it is a movie or giving people a real and credible feeling.
The director has a solid foundation, and many shots reveal the language of the shot intentionally or unintentionally.
Like a knife pierced into the center of a donut, this movie is sweet and bloody, giving people a light and agile, sometimes ""roller coaster"" style viewing experience. It can make people fully immersed in the purest ornamental nature of such suspense comedy, and it can show social problems by showing a lot of details without preaching."
2229,Loved the style of the film. Would love to see the whole movie again with a different ending (like Clue)
2230,"The storyline was impeccable for this movie, and the character progression and depth is captivating to watch."
2231,I was pleasantly surprised at this movie. I love the quirky main character. The movie may have felt a little slow but a twist at the end made it a great watch!
2232,"Wasn't sure at first. A little slow to get started but a clever film and top acting.
A nice change from action - marvel or war films"
2233,Great screening and sequence of events. it will keep you really excited throughout the movie. Amazing actors.
2234,"Amazing movie, actors, costumes, camera shots, acting, daniel craig, story, everything is so good! Too bad it didn't win an oscar and was just nominated!
Daniel craig is awesome honestly"
2235,"The movie just gets better and better as the time passes by. At first you think ""what kind of movie is this revealing the killer itself now, where is the suspense?"" But hold on right there, the movie still hold you to your seat till the very end as the real killer is still a mystery. Everything is just so goddamn perfect the acting, the cast, the story, the direction, the dialogues. Must watch if you a fan of thriller suspence movies."
2236,Very fun murder-mystery movie that doesn't necessarily try to keep you guessing until the end but still manages to have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. The excellent acting is a delight even if I have a really hard time not thinking of James Bond when I see Daniel Craig... he could at least change his hair or something!
2237,"So a quick summary (as a long essay about the film follows), this film is beautiful. From the aesthetic pleasure it provides with its cinematography to the plot. I can only think of one part where it kind of lacks which is firstly the famous blood stain and secondly no performance is Oscar-level. It is a must watch for me.Plot: ExcellentWhile it starts using a really cliché idea it does not follow the traditional path and quite frankly, everything is really unexpected. The characters are also really well built which solidifies the base of the screenplay making it sort of bulletproof to logical blunders. Lastly, the story is compelling as it had me hooked from start to finish.Direction & Cinematography: ExcellentI originally had them split up, but thus I wasn't giving enough credit to the director. Anyways, the way it was directed served the story justice by complementing its strengths and covering its minimal flaws. One of them is the fact that there is a lot of explaining done. To keep the audience engaged you have parts of the narration depicted as if you're inside the narrator's head. Moving more to the cinematography side, the aesthetics are superb. Almost everything takes place inside of a house. The selection of which is astonishing. Its exterior serves the story flawlessly but the real deal is its interior. Firstly its so beautiful I could just watch shots of it and be entertained, but nonetheless it really compliments the story's complexity. To be honest I knew I would enjoy the aesthetics of the film just by the first scene with the dogs running across a misty landscape with a beautiful mansion in the background.Performances: DecentAt first I was sort of reluctant on how Daniel Craig and Chris Evans would perform as their roles were really far from what I -at least- am used to seeing from them. First things first, Craig was astonishing all along just giving you the vibe of the deep down really smart detective who comes across kind of silly. Chris Evans on the other hand was simply ok. He seemed a little bit off but nothing that busted the film. But, I was really surprised by Jamie Lee Curtis, she had a really good performance (possibly the best out of the entire crew) and by Ana de Armas. To finish it off even the secondary actors did an amazing job of complimenting that feeling of uneasiness that was all over the house."
2238,"A brilliantly written screenplay with twist and turns and its incredible cast. Giving the old murder movie feel and creating a mysterious air and tone, this is a type of movie that we want to have more."
2239,"It's best movie I've been seen in last years it's Very fun, very mysterious and very funny"
2240,"I loved the look but I also felt like the mystery was more about an accident or something. I liked that it tried to be different from other mysteries in that way. But just like on its own or whatever not comparing it to the genre, it could have landed better. That's a lame review maybe and I like the actors and director and probably recommend it just to see what you think. I am glad I watched it. I just felt like about a third of it missed the mark. But mysteries are cool and there should be more so I applaud that for sure."
2241,"Knives Out Crime/Mystery movies are so entertaining for the viewer, it's a combination of 5 Genres that the movie tastes them all, at the early beginnings i was lost with the characters a bit so you need to keep your attention to them because it's your responsiblty to catch the murder, i do like those movies that we the viewers take prediction and keep our informations to know who did that this brings suspense to it, this is such a great thing to see Captain America (Chris Evans) in movies like that we need this guy to drop more on all other genre's and James Bond (Daniel Craig) is such awesome to see him agian on this both of them are fully talented, despite this movie being a great crime/mystery movie let's not forget the director/writer (Rian Johnson) well done we must all appreciate the guy and one more amazing news is that we will have Knives Out 2 for the future so lets wait and see what he is gonna do next, the ending well to be honest i wasn't suprised that much but things that were told were really on point, highly recommended this movie doesn't disappoint you, 8/10⭐"
2242,"A solid piece of entertainment, bringing obviously to mind many Agatha Christie movies, but also Diva from the 1980s, in that everything on screen is done to amuse the audience. Here's an idea for a sequel: have a completely new story, set in England, and use the same cast. This time however, change all the roles around. Craig can be an English patriarch, Jamie Lee Curtis the detective with an accent that careers from Mancunian to Cockney without warning, Johnson can be a prim conservative banker, and Plummer can be the dotty old grandmother."
2243,"I don't normally pay attention to oscar season but with such amazing movies like Parasite and JoJo Rabbit getting nominations I decided to check this one out. The first 30 minutes or so of this movie are very solid, and the set design is what really drew me in though. After that however, I kept waiting for it to be good and for it to get more suspenseful but it never did. I realized that it never got good because pretty much all information about the family was found out in the interviews. Then, it was revealed that the muderee actually killed himself halfway through the movie. I kept waiting for that to be a fakeout but it never was. The nurse character who thinks she killed him for some reason, the detective takes a liking to her, showing her evidence. (Even though she should still be treated as a suspect but I guess it is because of the puke whenever she lies thing). The detective's accent is very bad I could tell he was British the first time he talked. Micheal Scott does a better southern draw in The Office when they are playing that murder mystery game. I don't know why they didn't just make him french or British because that still would have fit with the character. The part that ruins it for me however is the culprit. He is the most obvious bad guy ever. He literally acts the most like a jerk and his name is literally Ransom. Where they even trying? A smarter writer would have made him a red herring. That's what I thought he was because the ""You're Back Again Ransom"" was so painfully obvious. When he was revealed to be the culprit I was hoping it was a fake out and when it wasn't I was so unsatisfied. Also, if he didn't hire the detective the cops would have assumed it was just a suicide so he foiled his own plot? It doesn't help also how the nurse is with him half of the movie and he is the only character with any character development. I do love the critique of the rich vs poor as a theme in a movie but it is so poorly done here. The only way we ""know"" that the rich family is bad and the poor nurse is good is because the detective keeps saying it. Come on, show don't tell. I don't know how this got nominated for an oscar because I agreed with a lot of the choices this year and this film is just messy. Toni Colette and Jamie Lee Curtis did what they could with this lazy script. I can't believe I'm saying this but the Netflix film ""Murder Mystery"" with Adam Sandler and Jennifer Anniston is more enjoyable and true to the murder mystery format. I would recommend watching that instead."
2244,Not too bad not perfect but definitely worth watching
2245,"I was engaged from the get go. I really enjoyed watching and waiting to see what was going to happen next. It's unpredictable, it can keep you hooked plus the performances are outstanding. Brilliant direction from Rian Johnson."
2246,"LOL, excellent humour and subverting our expectations, what didn't work in Star Wars.....!"
2247,"On YouTube, I have accidentally watched the final scene where they showed who is the killer. Yet I WAS WRONG. It is that good. You see who they arrest at the end, and then watch and you got surprised.. WOW.. Such a twist."
2248,"Another movie covering up most aspects of society. Only unrealistic thing is a man cutting own throat , who was well without a previous sucicidal intent. I enjoyed watching the movie"
2249,Brilliantly summed up story with a truely engaging plot.
2250,"Such a good movie! The best James Bond I have seen in a long long time, although slightly confusing as there was less shooting and less car chases than normal. Also did a weird mix up with Captain America but he didn't wear his uniform. Nonetheless, so so good. Just watch it"
2251,"Finally a mystery film without slang languages. The story was great! Although I already thought what happened, but it is still thrilling!"
2252,"...or so the line goes. A detective mystery till the very end, with a few twist along the way, paced skillfully to hold your attention but also keep you wondering for more. A weird (and perhaps miscast) detective hired to find the killer in your, probably, typical rich family. Good acting, few laughs along the way and a touching story of true friendship in a world that revolves around money.
Bit longish, but worth your time. Excellent friday/saturday night movie. Highly recommended."
2253,"After a long time finnaly something worth watching! This movie had my attention from the first minute. Great plot, cast, director."
2254,Good smooth perfect crime thriller with big names....
2255,"An engaging and hilarious whodunit with one of its biggest twists being an early reveal and a shift in the point of tension that works wonderfully well and adds a good heaping of heart to the already whip-smart script (see the knife line tie-in at the end, the return of the mug in one of the best final shots I've ever seen). The final twist is well-drawn but a little drawn-out, but that's the only misstep in this marvelously decorated, cleverly edited, and perfectly acted mystery/family drama."
2256,"Great ditective flick. I love these, and they should do more of this kind vs popping out superhero movies left and right.
One big mishap, is MOA of morphine. Now if it was fleeting detail, it wouldn't matter, but you would think movie makets would at least do a quick research on the drugs, its effects, overdosing and how do you actually die from it, opioid being controlled substance, etc. You'd think they would bring an expert on this for a quick tweak of details and making the story better.
Btw never seen 100mg vial of morphine nore toradol for that matter. And hot damn 100mg toradol IV every night. This old man must be blood bricks everynight."
2257,"As a darker than coal Cuban veteran I really enjoy anti white narration of this film. My only concern is, why this dumb people in america do it to themselves? It is suspicious."
2258,"Perfectly blended mixture of comedy and mystery,a must watch movie."
2259,"How come chris evans don't act much.
his performance is incredible, i would love to see him in other movies i mean alot"
2260,"This movie was fantastic. Every actor was flawless. The story is a super creative twist on the ""Clue"" theme with a bunch of easter eggs of the game inside. Ana De Armas was fantastic and as beautiful as always. Daniel Craig was mesmerizing in his role and i hope this becomes a franchise with an other mystery to unravel each movie à la Sherlock Holmes. Tony Colette and Jamie Lee were fantastic too my highlights of the side cast. Little bit of cringe dialogue politically at one part of the movie i did not like but for the rest this is a fantastic movie."
2261,"A who-done-it that serves us 2 hours of delightful suspense as a pampered family are confronted by the apparent suicide of their patriarch... or is not everything as simple as they're all trying to make the hired private detective believe?Not a single dull moment, a must watch for any fan of this genre!"
2262,"Wonderful on every level. Have not enjoyed a movie more in years.
Avoid spoilers and try and guess where it is going"
2263,"Rian Johnson's well-crafted, wonderfully atmospheric, hugely enjoyable old fashioned all-star whodunnit that is a deliciously retro thriller with a modern twist. It concerns a world renowned eccentric best-selling mystery-crime novelist Harlan Thrombey, marvelously played by the great Christopher Plummer, who is found dead with a slit throat and the knife still in his hand at his massive estate after his 85th birthday, was it a suicide? There in lays the tale. A debonair Southern detective with an oversized ego named Benoit Blanc, sensationally played by the charismatic Daniel Craig in a scene-stealing Golden Globe Award nominated for Best Actor, is determined to follow up on his colleague police Lieutenant Eliot's theory that Harlan's death with a suicide, because he believes otherwise. So he assembles all of the combative and dysfunctional relatives that attended Harlan's birthday party to be interviewed by him, they are all terrifically played by a stellar cast which includes Jamie Lee Curtis as the tough property developer, Toni Collette as an Instagram influencer, Don Johnson as the weaselly son-in-law, Michael Shannon as the bugged-eyed frustrated-publisher son, and Christ Evans as the trouble-making trust-funder grandson. Special kudos to the beautiful Ana de Armas for her endearing and wonderful Golden Globe Award nominated turn for Best Actress as Harlan's loyal house nurse Marta Cabrera. Indeed everyone has something to hide, but which one of them is the murderer? Brilliant direction by Johnson who also wrote the clever and captivating Oscar nominated original screenplay. An inventive, witty, dryly funny motion picture with a crowd-pleasing panache. One of the year's best films. Highly recommended."
2264,"Knives out from the beginning acts as a classic murder mystery full of eccentric characters all in the modern setting. From the very start the movie is able to captivate you, being one of the few movies of 2019 that truly fully captured my attention, as you wait to see how the mystery unfolds all leading to a shocking twist which by itself is enough to the see the movie for. And the characters are all bought to life with each actor/actress able to fully bring out all the specific characteristics of each person that makes them so fun to watch at. This is truly one of the better movies of 2019 and something that everyone should watch (even if murder mysteries aren't your particular brand of donut)."
2265,"I love the movie, fresh, A class actors, nice mystery, each character is well played and finally some very watchable classic. Even the environment... finally you can see lot of details it is not massively flashing like in all action drama super CGI scenes. I did really enjoyed the plot and the atmosphere around. And who is calling him self to be able review movies and underrate this movie is simply idiot or very poor mind or cheap overstimulated teen. And like in the movie, I will vomit if it's not true. :)"
2266,It is predictable but enjoyable. Nice drama not a masterpiece though.
2267,"Brilliant!!!!
At last an amazing modern film ,made in an old fashioned traditions of classic detective genre!Arthur Conan Doyle,Agatha Christi,Wilkie Collins,Georges Simenon,would be delighted if only they could have seen this movie!
Actors are amazing as the rest of it all!!!Rare 10 stars from me!!!Highly recommended!!!"
2268,"This is a very classic, Agatha Christie, style whodunit.This has all the classic elements: a big mansion on the hill, strong improbable characters, a cold self-serving family, suspicious help and a pragmatic detective with a questionable accent.A huge amount of love has been poured into this.
It is intriguing and dramatic and quirky and humorous in all the right places.Like the classic whodunit films the pace is kept purposely slow - although it has been kicked into second gear to make things a little fresher.It is clever, but not so clever that you can't have fun working things out - and the story actually works.Direction, acting, production and camera work is great.
There are lots of little Easter eggs scattered around and references to the genre - like the old letter-box lighting around a characters eyes that was so popular at one time.
A great film, easily the best of 2020 so far."
2269,"Wow
I've never seen a better Murder mystery.
What a direction and what a story?"
2270,Excellent movie....very entertaining...excellent casting and a nice twist at the end.
2271,"The movie is good. Like an Agatha Christie mystery. It is definitely worth seeing. Many twists and suspense. The only part which just kind of ""turned me off"" way the terrible southern accent of Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig). He could have at least spoken in French!"
2272,"This is an action-packed American detective, designed in the classical style of the genre. This movie was directed by Rian Johnson. He was also a screenwriter and producer. He was inspired by the famous stories of Agatha Christie and wanted to make a mystery movie about the murder.
The plot of the film revolves around the mysterious death of a famous writer who suddenly committed suicide in the presence of all his relatives.
The plot scheme is simple: all heroes find themselves in a confined space and one of them suddenly dies. The police are creating an obvious and believable picture of what happened. And then a damn savvy detective enters the scene. He gradually finds a bunch of mysterious inconsistencies, and each hero reveals significant motives for the murder.
The family of wealthy writer Harlan Tromby gathers in a posh mansion to celebrate his anniversary. In the morning, grandfather is found with a throat. The police arrive, and the heirs are locked in the house, like spiders in a bank. The police are ready to admit suicide, but the famous detective Benoit Blanc, played by Daniel Craig, intervenes.
All relatives of the deceased were very dependent on his money and they all claim a rich inheritance. And the detective himself doesn't know who hired him.
Further, the director shows us a fascinating investigation, which strictly complies with all the laws of the genre. The story unfolds like a ball of thread, gradually opening the curtain of secrecy. At the same time, the creators deliberately try to confuse you in order to maintain interest. This is the most difficult trick in such kind of films. The movie is breathtaking. All characters are different and their images are vivid.
The moral in this film is simple and says that you need to remain a good person, no matter what.
The visual style makes the film very atmospheric. Almost all the scenes in the film unfold in the mansion.
With a relatively small budget, the director was able to assemble a very worthy cast: Daniel Craig, Michael Shannon, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans and distinguished Actor Christopher Plummer.
I strongly recommend this detective, especially if you like this genre of films just like me!"
2273,"I have scored it 9 out of 10, just because i was waiting for so long to experience genuinely this kind of mistry and thrill from a detective movie. And i am so far satisfied by this one. I was so impressed at first that i nearly compared it with next to Sherlock Holmes kinda film. But yeah, as in i put the title, if you want a true detective essence, the True detective series will surely help you but, this 2 hours long film is no way lesser than that."
2274,"I really liked to watch the movie. The plot, the characters, the pace. One that put me off was Daniel Craig's awful accent. It would be much much better with his native tongue."
2275,"Good movie, good characters. But Daniel Craig's accent is just so terrible."
2276,"I'm not a pro reviwer but all I'm saying that, this movie is really good and worth the watch. Please watch it for Cap sake."
2277,"If you don't like immigrants, you will LOVE this film. Please watch it."
2278,"Watched this evening and thoroughly enjoyed. You little reveals keep coming, some real, some just to throw you.
Holds your interest and intrigue until the end... if it doesn't, then you'll probably be more at home with a Michael Bay movie..."
2279,Very entertainment movie to enjoy. At Beggining i thought Marta is the murder by herself.
2280,"Marta the nurse is the killer, she played everyone included Harlan and the detective, if you still believe she was innocent and know nothing about the Harlan's will, which gives her no motivation, you are the one of dumbasses as well.First thing first, what happened in the Harlan's bedroom at the night he was dead is from Marta, she told the detective and showed to us. Great, if you really believe that BS, how is it a lie, you may ask, she can't lie for she will puke, just as she deliberately showed to Detective Blanc and the policemen during her first interview. Brilliant, I must say, she played everyone like fiddles. So, what really happened?She perhaps, not merely ""friend"" of Harlan, dare I say, she is a lover of Harlan, what they did in that room including ""what you know"" between two lovers would usually do. Therefore, the only logical explanation why Harlan changes his final will when he is fully sober is that he loves Marta and think Marta loves him as well. For Marta she probably knows the will from Harland, at least she outsmarts him so she can tell from the daily conversation and Go playing.At that night Harlan was dead, Marta can tell she inject the right medicine, once again, in the final of the movie she can tell the slight differences between them, so she can definitely tell the nuances at that night. She knew someone switched them to play dirty, she decided let them play, she maybe causes the Harlan's suicide or she cut his throat by her own hands, we can't know because Harlan is dead. She sneaked back to home and waited Ransom to play, by the time she might not know for sure it was him, anyone in this family was possible.What happened next was almost exactly she expected. We have to notice that since beginning of the movie, she dismissed her mother's complain about her sister listening the murder show, if she was worried as heck about her misdoing caused Harlan's death, she should at least show some emotions and worrisome, however she showed nothing but calm, she is a cold blood murder or player.In the end, the dumbass Blanc and the others were convinced she was decent, smart, innocent and ""lie to puke"" nurse who deserves everything, and Ransom attempts to murder Harland and murders Fran, so he should go to jail, and rest of family are bad, which I don't deny, so should move away and live in poverty. Just like most of us have been outsmarted by her. The moment she stood on the balcony and hold the cup on which written ""my house my rule"", she declared her decisive victory and mocked the rest.TLDR; Marta planed it since beginning, don't be fooled by her trick and lying POV. This film is like Life of Pi without final reveals of darkness, you need to be smart enough to figure it out by yourself."
2281,"If you want a Sherlock Holmes night with the family or your buds, this is a great pick. And you also get to see Ana de Armas enough to be satisfied with it. It's a pretty original story, well-told, with twists and anticipated conundrums, enough to keep you enticed, but you don't have to rack your brain too hard, everything reveils itself clearly and at the right time. Top notch actors delivering a good, light and ocasionally comedic performance and a happy-end. Can't ask for more from a Sunday evening flick."
2282,This movie is very catchy but it's very similar to the movie crooked house that was based on a novel.
2283,Unique and brilliant take on who done it genre. and not because of many twists but because its layered ironic and brilliant work of art. movie that is extremely well written and at the same time has fun with genre itself. My one beef is casting Ana de Armas. she is not very good.
2284,"I created an IMDB account just to review this. This movie is entertaining , funny and fun to watch. The ending was perfect! The great reveal made my jaw drop! I don't know if anyone could predict the twist at the end . Definitely the best comedy of the year and the best mystery of the year"
2285,Never a dull moment. This is a fun and exciting movie with all of the plot twists you would expect in a clue movie.
2286,"I usually don't review movies, I'm just lazy. I love mystery movies but I can't find enough, I feel like I have watched most of the good ones anyway. I was eagerly waiting for this movie to come out HD and I just watched it, and I can say it's in my Top 3 best mystery movies of all time. It was so thrilling and amazing!!! When you just ask yourself ""why are they revealing how it happened in the middle of the movie"", you find out that it's only a part of it.Truly brilliant, I wish there were more movies like this. If you're into mystery movies, start watching right now and give it your full attention, because if you miss just one bit, the story will not make sense."
2287,"I can see a lot of things can go wrong with this film. But fortunately, none of it happens. Every twist and turn went precisely, with great pacing. Knives Out is a very 'neat' film."
2288,"I feel most of the missing percent of my rating comes from how fast everything was wrapped up. The plot of the movie was great, the plot twist were great however there were so many things that were almost impossible for the average viewer to deciper before the summary everything new at the end just seems thrown together but otherwise great movie."
2289,"Knives Out is the preeminent, unsurpassed murder mystery arguably of all time ...consisting of paramount intrigue ... the most intricate in my opinion to date! The sophistication of the plot, the suspense, the drama, the maneuvering, and the vacillating implicit conspiracy theories kept me guessing...I loved it!! Contact the authorities! Daniel Craig as the transcendent principal investigator Benolt Blanc, LaKeith Stanfield as the contemplative, methodical Lieutenant Elliott and Noah Segan as the trustworthy and honorable Trooper Wagner all arrived. They were all exceptional!This family contains the duplicitous, the over achievers, the wannabees and the spoiled rotten, led by Christopher Plummer as the long-standing trailblazer Harlan Thrombey. Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson as Linda and Richard Drysdale, along with their son Ransom (Chris Evans), all flawlessly depicted the close-knit and favored relatives. Jamie Lee Curtis nailed the representation of the preferential oldest sibling complete with the constant and the arduous seeking of parental approval, staying very close to her father.Michael Shannon is Walt Thrombey who is the brother who tries so hard, yet perhaps falls short of expectations, along with his two free-spirited offspring Jacob and Donna (Jaeden Martell and Riki Lindhorne). Family widow and sister-in-law Joni Thrombey who is our wonderful Toni Collette and her on-screen daughter, Meg a cousin, a granddaughter and a wise and strategic player played by Katherine Langford. Both who very much remain a part of the family fabric.Ana de Armas is Marta Cabrera who was outstanding! Marta characterized a meticulous and reliable personal nurse to Harlan holding all of the family secrets. Lastly, K. Callen is the wondrous timeworn matriarchy, Greatnana Wannetta; the wise old owl, who is seen and never heard. In full, this clan is a hand-full!Rian Johnson the writer and director quintessentially and observantly captures each of the eccentric personalities featuring the all too common familial competitive rivalry, jockeying, over-indulgence and familiar grievances we all unfortunately recognize especially with large, complex families of considerable wealth and influence. Rian Johnson valiantly addresses matters with intellectual superiority, unpredictability yet familiarity, antidotes replete with modern day societal concerns that he heroically drops directly into the main conflict like a bomb, forcing audiences to grapple with its consequences. This movie deserves an Oscar!"
2290,"Nothing more to add...Moving along.As for you, get your corn popping and watch the hell out of it!"
2291,"Without Daniel Craig,this movie may be mormal film"
2292,"As a fan of murder mystery movies, I'll have to say that most of them follow a formula.
There is a murder. There is a detective and after that you scratch your head till the end. Who did it? In the end you get the answer. But this film doesn't follow that formula. Ok it does follow the formula for half an hour. But after that it's a different film.
What's good:
1. As I said, the film doesn't stick to the formula genre film and takes a different route which works.
2. The actors have done a great job with what they were given especially Ana De Armas. You can call it her movie.
3. The film has comedy some of which is political as well.
What's bad:
1. Daniel Craig's role should have been better. He was wasted in the movie.
If you are a fan of Murder Mystery/Suspense movies, you'll love it."
2293,"Like Sherlock (S1E1) once said:""Clever, clever yessss!!"""
2294,Loved it. It was really interesting to find out how it ended. How the detectives find the killer. Really liked it. Great movie.
2295,"When i saw it the first time i thought it came from some Agatha Christie book. When the family gathered by the private inspector in the end, I waited for the classic Poirot sentence ""mesdames et messieurs"". But it was predictable for me (knife, vomit)"
2296,"The heading says it, it was a good film. Every now and then I thought it's dragging a bit. But the story is good, interesting plot twist and the actors are good too! I wouldn't say it's a must see though, as there's nothing that really stuck with me afterwards in terms of wondering / thinking / debating.."
2297,I didnt excpect it would be very good like that . You have got to watch it
2298,"What a movie! No superheroes, no computer graphics, no violence, nothing broken except a trellis of a false window! Just about, say, 50ml of blood spilt. Nobody was out to destroy the worlds or universe and no one in capes with their underwear worn outside to save the planets. Lovely music. Lovely environs of a huge old house filled with scene stealing bric-a-bracs. Superb actors in an ensemble cast all of who were made to do exactly what the director wanted and they did it superbly. A whodunit movie from the good old times when they used to tell a good story that made sure that your finger never went near the pause button. An intoxicating combination of Christie and Hitchcock. A lovely heroine, without makeup or skilfully underdone one, who is a murder suspect. A rich old man found with his throat cut and many of his family members have the motive to do him in. A suicide by cutting one's own throat - a first for me in a crime movie. Suicde? Accident? Murder? The story moves as fast and smoothly as a Federer backhand.
But it has as many twists as Nadal's topspin forehand, with a nasty bounce. Dialogues are sharp and to the point as in the old noir
movies.The charisma and screen presence of the ex 007 and Captain America himself are utilised to the full. The climax is gripping and not long drawn out. Everything picture perfect and I won't ask pardon for the pun. The only jarring note for me was the accent of the private detective Blanc. Perhaps it was done to ward off the evil eye, a dristi pottu as we say in Tamil. All in all a movie which will not
cause the critics to come with their Knives Out! The capo de tutti capi of directors, one M. Scorcese must have been delighted to watch this opus of Rian Johnson. The good news is that a sequel is planned for the future. Did we see the beginning of a franchise? Most welcome sez I."
2299,"Rian Johnson writes and directs this wickedly pointy ensemble murder mystery, which finds a large, snobby family at odds over the untimely demise of their allegedly-beloved patriarch and the impending redistribution of his wealth.The first hour is a particularly brilliant bit of deceptive filmmaking, shifting from one unreliably-narrated flashback to the next, while the audience is left to make sense of all the lies and half-truths. Eccentric to the last, each member of this extended family has something to hide, a personal scandal or ulterior motive, and that's conveniently left out of their fond memories with the deceased. Though it's burdened with such a heavy cast, none feel extraneous or fade into the woodwork. They're each distinct and memorable, even if a few of the actors take things a bit over the top and flirt with parody. Daniel Craig might be the loudest such example, constantly over-playing his best Foghorn Leghorn accent, but he's got plenty of competition. Like a high-expense party game, most everybody has a gimmick. Some just work it a bit harder than the others.When it's on-point, Knives Out delights in toying with perception and reality, sharing the same events from multiple, highly biased, perspectives. It falters on the home stretch, though, dropping the cloak and dagger in favor of a rather blunt, linear final act. That's disappointing, but not crippling. Even with the limp climax, this is a quirky, amusing, well-composed mystery. Just seemed like it was on the fast-track to something more."
2300,"It's safe to assume that Rian Johnson polarizes people. He's a pretty decent writer who unfortunately can bog his script with some bad ideas. The ending of Looper and certain elements of The Last Jedi come to mind. However, his writing proves to be strong when everything works. And Knives Out works.A revival of the whodunit genre, Knives Out brings back some of the classic tropes of the murder mystery with a script that leaves little unused. A lot of elements, albeit not all, serve a purpose and come back to play an important part. Overall, I hope to see a franchise revolving around Benoit Blanc's cases.Blanc (Daniel Craig) is brought in to solve the murder of a family patriarch (Christopher Plummer). The suspects include his children (Jamie Lee Curtis, Toni Collette, Chris Evans, and Michael Shannon), their loved ones (Don Johnson, Katherine Wilford) and the caretaker Marta (Ana de Alvas). The family members have their motives, but only one person is guilty of murder.The script takes the tropes of British mystery genres and gives them an American setting: the wealthy family members, an inheritance, the butler/maid, the rebellious children, and the gentleman detective. Daniel Craig really enjoys playing this role, and I wouldn't want to see anyone else play this. The movie does lag a bit in the middle, but you start to see everything come together in a way that really surprised me. A lot of pieces serve as obvious symbolism or even return as a Chekhov's gun, but that's the fun of the whodunit: you want to see how every piece is played. The game of Go, the knives, even the dialogue serve a purpose.So there's a caveat that needs to be addressed and others will find in this film: the movie makes some heavy political jabs. A character's son is described as an ""alt-right troll"" and a nazi; another character's daughter is an SJW; there's a scene where everyone is arguing about Trump and illegal immigration. I, too, am getting tired of woke cinema lecturing Americans about how to vote. Hollywood has been deep in the Democrats' coffers and has made it clear that Andrew Breitbart was right - politics IS downstream from culture. Yet, the political tones aren't really as deep as some here have made it. At least, I didn't get a sense of lecturing from this film. The argument exists because Marta's mom is undocumented, and it foreshadows how the family will come after her near the end. But even the liberal characters, lifestyle guru Joni and her daughter, aren't shown as sympathetic characters. The former acts virtuous with her diatribes about ""locking children in cages"", but even she will throw someone under the bus for money. The alt-right grandson and granddaughter show no real signs of these labels; if no one said anything, you wouldn't really know. And you understand that the victim's intentions weren't political at all. It would be one thing if Joni was depicted as the voice of reason or in the right as Rose was supposed to be, but she wasn't. And this needs to be highlighted.I've seen woke cinema - The Intern, BlacKkKlansman, Captain Marvel, The Last Jedi. Even the new Little Women makes woke statements. But if the phrase ""go woke, go broke"" works 8 times out of 10, Knives Out is in the lucky 20%. Just know that just because it throws politics around doesn't necessarily mean it's political."
2301,"I get that people hate from SW8 but this movie is incredible.I was delighted all the way through. I particularly like the humor that they managed to subtly fit in around the nurse rather than force down your throat (clever writing!).However, my one complaint is the atrocious accent they have forced on Daniel Craig. What the hell is that garbage? It is grating on the ears every time he speaks! Either they should have cast someone else or should have let him speak normally. I understand they wanted to continue in the vein of Pink Panther etc and having the inspector be the classic French genius... but it could be American/French or British/French to have a normal accent rather than this fake French accent."
2302,"It shocked me many times. I watched it with my mouth open. So fun, so exciting movie. I'm looking forward to buy its bluray.. Well done to all of the actors!"
2303,"It's an amazing movie, with great characters and some great acting."
2304,"If you're a fan of mystery and crime investigation, you should sit to see this one.
They got great characters, awesome sets and the most dumb car chase haha
Lakeith Stanfield & Noah Segan characters' interaction with Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc and other casts was endearing to watch."
2305,Very funny. Great performances from a great lineup of actors. Tight writing with all the twists and turns of a good mystery. It should win best screenplay. Mystery is not my genre but I think every viewer will enjoy this ride.It's a fun movie.
2306,I had really big expectations and I'm pretty satisfied. You should see this piece of artwork. You better see it in theatre. Perfect story and ending.
2307,"""Knives Out"" was directed by Rian Johnson, starring Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas as its lead roles. Harlan Thrombey, the grandfather of the Thrombey family (played by Christopher Plummer) is murdered in the night of his 85th birthday. After a week two detectives and private investigator, Benoit Blanc are hired to unravel this murder mystery.What makes this Whodunnit work is Johnson's holy original take on the genre. The first and third act are told in a familiar way. However the second act has a very unique turn to it, as the audience gets a lot of information that is usually revealed much later.As far as concerns, there aren't that many. There were a few side characters that felt a little unnecessary to the plot and the movie shares a lot of its big reveals through (needed) exposition.Aside from that, Johnson has written and directed a beautiful and original vision to the genre. I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys crime thrillers or to someone who knows to appreciate a compelling story."
2308,"I've always enjoy a good Sherlock Holmes-ish movie, the murder mystery, the audacy of the detective to solving it and the inevitable mindblower plot twist. Rian Johnson accomplishes to mix the suspense of the murder mystery, a great comedy with an excelent cast. Daniel Craig's performance is so close and yet so far from James Bond. The Script is perfect, it goes zigzagging between drama and comedy, even the climax it's resolves with a big joke. If it wasn't for Once upon a time in Hollywood, every comedy award should be for this movie."
2309,"The best murder mystery, who-done-it comedy since Clue.
Full of surprises."
2310,"Just a wonderful illustration of a world falling apart and how people still try to catch it. Perfect acting, a lot of twists and a good story. The only downside is that the story is sometimes to perfect to work and some choices to stupid for reality. But still a strong recommendation."
2311,A movie in which the story is suspenseful and surprising. The comedy throughout the movie is subtle but enjoyable. It is refreshing to see a different side of acting from Daniel Craig other then his more popular role as James Bond. This movie does have cus words throughout the movie if you we thinking to bring a child.
2312,"I wasnt really a friend of Rian Johnson after what he did to Star Wars but im not gonna get into that here in detail.
My wife insisted on watching this and what a delight it was. Funny, smart with a twist that you didnt see coming too early. At first I was a bit taken aback by the reveal halfway through but it was interesting to see where the movie went from there and how it picked up again.
I felt reminded of my Childhood watching Hercule Poirot in black and white at my grandmothers house.
Definitely worth watching. Daniel Craigs accent is the only thing that bothered me about this ... when you've seen him being a brit over and over again it's kinda hard to buy the southern accent."
2313,"Realy liked the movie at some point i was like wait we know who did it so why do we need to watch te rest of the movie but at some point you begin thinking if something else happend and it did!
Realy loved the story and how they kept me thinking who or how it was done till the very end"
2314,"While yes I did predict what happened by midway through the film, it was still enjoyable to watch, particularly with such a witty family of characters making it amusing until the very end. From the sounds of the audience in the cinema with myself, the ending was not so easily guessed as most were shocked as the truth was revealed leading me to believe it is still a good ""whodunnit"" movie that will keep most people guessing until the end. And for those like myself that enjoy a good mystery and are good at solving them - it is very clever and worth the watch"
2315,"Really enjoyed this, great to have a good whodunnit back on the silver screen at long last. Also great to see Daniel Craig having an absolute ball in his role.
Good stuff."
2316,"If you ever read Agatha Christie, she can seem wordy, slow to reveal and just when you are getting bored drag you back into an enormously terrific plot. 'Knives Out' plays out like a game of clue or hide and go seek. Just when you think you have Mr Mustard in the Living Room with the Candle Stick your wrong!Do not expect a fast paced, heart pumping gotcha movie, it is a slow paced, well thought out mystery with lots of little turns and twists that even when you pay attention you missed the true story. Although it is slow it is not without its wit and humor. There are great laughs and well played characters you will not soon forget. If anything, Daniel Craig's Kentucky Fried accent will make you giggle more than once.The plot is deceptive and obvious all at once and makes for a good ride. Just when you think you have it all, there is more. Even when you think it is all over there is still more....and the laughs continue as well.I really enjoyed ""Knives Out"" for it's change of pace. It was dramatic, witty and fun. A good popcorn movie to enjoy and make you think....."
2317,"Big SPOILER alert.This movie makes NO sense if you just sit there like a potato and buy the premise that the guy who goes to jail at the end is the one who is ""really"" responsible for the crime (not the murder, maybe, in a way). Yes, it's hard to wrap your mind around it, but ""Knives Out"" subverts the ""who-dunnit"" genre and that probably upsets some fans of the familiar old-fashioned detective story.So what? In the end, this film actually twists around and pays homage, true homage, to an old stale movie trope. The mystery is solved in an impossible way. Something, maybe good, maybe not, triumphs over something else and it's all mind bending in a way that would make Christopher Nolan proud.Let's review. ALL of the clues point to the ""least likely"" suspect, but every red herring leads us to the ""obvious"" bad-guy. Is it him? Is he the ""killer?"" Well, if you just sit there and burp up your popcorn and don't think-- yeah, I guess the spoiled jerk is the bad-guy and goes to jail.But... who was the best Go player? Marta. Marta hides behind the goofiest ""tell"" in modern memory, she vomits when she lies! Oh baby, that's CORNY. But she USES it to set a trap. All the idiots in this family of wealthy heels fall into it, and eventually the one guy who sees the truth understands that she's the one who orchestrated the whole thing, BUT he decides to let her go. She really is a ""good person."" The rotten family she worked for DESERVE what they get. Justice. More important than ""truth?"" So Marta, who ""did it,"" goes free with all the money in her pocket, leaving room for a sequel when they realize that they've been conn3d.Fun movie. Not a ""who-dunnit."" More of a ""con job"" movie in the tradition of ""The Sting"" or ""American Hustle."" Ten stars."
2318,Reminds me of old school mystery novels. Sly twists. Very entertaining
2319,"It is a great Movie. A fine mixture of drama, comedy, politics and mystery.
The thing is, I think I've seen that Chair in some other movie or TV show.. I just can't remember which one.. And of course I'm not talking about the Iron Throne :)
Can anyone help me please?"
2320,"Apparently an unpopular these days but I adore Rian Johnson as a director, I've yet to see all his work but of what I've seen he's never made a film that I have not loved. Because of that Knives Out was one of my most anticipated movies of 2019 and more than that there was never a moment of doubt during the build up to seeing this film where I thought it would disappoint me. As I'd hoped this movie lived up to my expectations as well subverting them in all the right ways.Like the classic murder mystery's that inspired it, Knives Out has an incredible cast without a single weak link within it. Daniel Craig gives a Performance like he never has before and loved what he did here. I got used to the accent he used and loved the eccentricity he brought. Ana De Armas has really come Into her own over the last few years and this is the best I've ever seen her, she's a star in the making and this film just proves it even more. Chris Evans, Jaime Lee Curtis And Michael Shannon all give performances against their usual type and loved all of them here, as despicable as their characters were they were still so engaging to watch thanks to the writing and their performances.Despite the cast, Rian Johnson is the real star of this film. His blend of drama and humour worked perfectly. Despite the amount of brilliant comedy it never took away from the mystery aspects or the tension. His writing was subversive of the usual ways in which we expect a mystery to be portrayed and left me wondering where exactly the movie was going in the best possible way. This really keeps the movie original and fresh which definitely made for a unique experience of watching this movie for the first time. My only issue with his script was the overload of exposition, there obviously has to be a lot in a complex mystery like this but the expository scenes feel overlong and drawn out at many points.Knives Out is endlessly rewarding, intelligently written and so much fun as a movie. While Rian Johnson may be the true star, the entire cast is incredible with many of them giving performances against their usual type and succeed at it wonderfully. It's full of humour while still maintaining a great deal of character and tension. I can't waiting to see what Johnson does next whether it's another entry in this world or something else that is completely original.9.5/10 - A (Phenomenal)"
2321,"Very well done. Acting was superb. Would watch again. The condition of the theater was my only complaint (AMC in Voorhees, NJ) very dirty and misconceived seating that was assigned in advance. No never attained there again.Again, the movie was great and I thought the respect of the audience intelligence was maintained."
2322,"The film is similar to the Girl with the Dragon tattoo ask me why, here are some instances
1. family investigation
In the Dragon tattoo Craig was investigating matters of a family which is similar to this plus both of the cases involves someone in the family being murdered
2. Craig assistant is a female to be precise ""young"" in both films it is evident
the only difference is that Knives out has a element of comedy"
2323,"Directed by Rian Johnson, Knives Out is a very stylish, very classical murder mystery. A whodunit story, following in the footsteps of Agatha Christie and other masters.This is most apparent in style and the visuals. The head of a family is dead and the family is gathering together to bury him and to settle such minor questions as inheritance and what really happened to grandfather. And obviously a gentleman detective just happens to turn up, ready to help. A premise straight from a Christie book. And the manour itself is also gloriously weird, filled with odd angles, bizarre knickknacks, scary mementos and enough Baroque aesthetic to make you fear the dark.However, while it is clear Johnson obviously loves this genre and wants to do it justice, he's not content simply rehashing old tropes and doing them correctly. He wants to take the genre forward, do something different with it. Innovate. And he succeeds. The film can be called a whodunit, but that's not entirely accurate, at least not the whole way through. Can't really say more about that without spoilers, but suffice to say the film has a few surprises in store for you.It's also brilliantly acted, benefiting from an ensemble cast of actors. A couple who stand out are Daniel Craig as the gentleman detective Benoit Blanc and Ana de Armas as Marta Cabrera, nurse of the late head of family and the supposed main character of the film. But all the actors are great. True, there are a couple of characters that don't get much screen time, making them rather one note, but that's the price of telling the story, I suppose.Knives Out is what happens when someone takes something he really loves, but not so much that he's unwilling to see it change. Rather he loves it so much that he wants to make it even better. And that's when the magic happens."
2324,"All I can say is "" Just watch it and thank me later""."
2325,"It parades as a standard murder-mystery, only Johnson is too cerebral for something so simple. Unlike most in the genre, we know who the killer is within 30 minutes, and the mystery is refreshingly more about motive and fallout, creating a web of wicked fun, all the way to the fantastic final shot. There's a plethora of standout performances (de Armas, Collette, Curtis, Johnson, Evans), but Craig as a charming southern Poirot-cover is revelatory."
2326,"Wow, what a broken family.
This movie is all about a detective who is driven to find a murder within some really selfish relatives. The whole cast is acting fabulous and beside some really good funny parts, the plot is pretty exciting. Be prepared for curious verities and enjoy this slightly different crime story.If you love to figure out the murder for yourself or if you just want to watch characters like Sherlock Holmes or Miss Marple doing a great job, this movie is for you.Have Fun!Cheers,
Fletcher"
2327,"I never really saw any trailers for Knives Out, I assumed it was going to be the normal mystery story, but I was wrong, ""Knives Out"" provided a fresh story, with a complex but very interesting plot. When you think you know something the film goes and proves you wrong, I didn't even see what happened at the end coming.The plot was very interesting from the death the audience were trying to come up with who done it, I came up with some suspects of my own, but I didn't see the end twist coming, when we find out who actually done it. I think when you throw people off it makes the entire film better because you want to know who did it and more importantly how.The acting was great, some standouts were Chris Evans, Daniel Craig (at first I was not very keen on the accent) and Ana de Armas.The cinematography was pretty great, we got a cool variety of shots in this film, the colours used were also really good, in a way they almost reflected the characters tones in the movie, such as Chris Evans' Character wore a brown jacket and brown is often associated with crap. In the film is personality was very dull and angry, not to say I didn't enjoy his character, but that's the vibes I get off that character.Overall I gave ""Knives Out"" a 9 star rating, I enjoyed the dark humour, the weirdness it brought with it and everything else!
I really recommend you see this movie if you really like dark humour and murder mystery films."
2328,"I wasn't sure what I was expecting from this movie. I only thought it would be just a mystery movie but the movie also felt like a comedy movie. It was the same thing I felt when I decided to watch Clue.
Everyone did their part and it was spot on. If there's going to be a sequel, I can't wait."
2329,"Knives Out is a wildly creative, fun and, yes, subversive whodunnit murder mystery! Knives Out features and excellent ensemble cast and a compelling narrative filled with twists and turns! One of the most entertaining, politically/socially relevant and original films I saw this year. It's nice to have a mystery movie not based on a book so everyone doesn't already know who did it going in. I actually don't know how much I want to say about this movie, there's not much I can really say about it without giving away major spoilers. I'd say just go out and see it for yourself. It's really good, you'll have a TON of fun! Get to the theatre early, it's still selling out over a month after releasing! I'm so happy it's doing so well, it's a real crowd pleaser. I guess it really was Star Wars fans that were the problem after all. Good to know."
2330,"One of the most under-utilized genres to date, a good mystery movie is hard to find these days. This is partly why Knives Out (2019) is such a joy to watch. With plenty of twists and turns-and a murderer that subverts all the numerous tropes of the genre-this film is almost on the edge of self-aware satire of mysteries on the whole. This is partly why I found Knives Out to be delightfully amusing: the absurd nature of some of the genre's most tightly-held motifs were playfully subverted for a couple of genuine laughs.Of course, part of the problem of Knives Out being so self-aware is that it is inevitably predictable at several key moments. Depending on how far ahead a viewer can deduce the solution to a critical piece of evidence might determine how predictable it is for them. I did appreciate that there was always one piece of the puzzle that remained unsolved to keep the plot moving along, but there were also enough clues that helped make some of the twists a bit more evident than they probably should have been.In terms of the cast, Knives Out sports a veritable ""who's who"" that will make the ""6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon"" game much easier in the future. Some individuals, like Jamie Lee Curtis, were woefully underused, but Michael Shannon and Chris Evans stand out as exemplary roles in this film. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Daniel Craig, who seems to be having fun distancing himself from his iconic James Bond role. While his performance is undoubtedly one of the reasons you should watch this film, I was slightly distracted by his choice of accent, which just sounded odd at times.A refreshing take on the mystery genre, I give Knives Out 4.0 stars out of 5."
2331,My husband and I loved this film from start to finish. So many twists and turns but an easy to follow plot. This was like Columbo meets Holmes meets Agatha Christie. I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good whodunnit. All the cast were brilliant especially Ana De Armasmand Daniel Craig. We are hoping we might see his detective Benoit Blanc get a second film.
2332,"An old and classical story happened in the modern age brings not only the fight for inheritance, but also some modern problems - immigration, politics, and etc. Talking about where Marta comes from, three countries are mentioned in the whole movie - Ecuador by Linda, Uruguay by Richard (Linda's husband), and Brazil by Ransom. Some details are very interesting - the birthday cake serving scene (everybody thought they were the closest people to their father), the coffee cup, and etc. The plot is fascinating, and the ending is unexpected. I did not get bored for a single moment. Besides, definitely see the determination in trying different characters of Steve Rogers."
2333,"It's a little tongue in cheek, there are some plot lines a little hard to swallow and it moves a little slow at first, but it delivers in the end. Think Wes Anderson meets Agatha Christie. Great characters, intriguing plot lines and unintended mishaps along the way. What a great pleasure to have humor derived from language and sight gags that don't involve farting jokes and profane language. A good way to pass an afternoon or evening.."
2334,"Knives Out is the latest movie of Rian Johnson, and boy does he deliver ! A spiffing screenplay combined with an excellent cast and sly editing makes for an edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller which will keep you guessing. Fans of comedy will not be disappointed either, with many subtle yet funny jokes sprinkled all over the movie.The driving forces behind this captivating whodunnit are none other than Ana de Armas as the likable and compassionate caretaker Martha Cabrera, and Daniel Craig as the slick and bit enigmatic detective Benoit Blanc. The latter I would dare say is maybe even worthy of an Academy Award, even though his manufactured southern accent is at first a bit off-putting. The entertainment value and intriguingness of the movie makes sure that quickly becomes a problem of the past however.All in all, Knives Out is a excellent murder mystery which delivers many curveballs. I highly recommended it for ordinary moviegoers and I believe it is a true must see for fans of the mystery genre !8/10"
2335,"Honestly, I did not know what to expect going into this movie, which made watching it 100 times better.The plot, the acting, and especially the cinematography took a slightly worn-out genre and instilled it with such life that kept me on the edge of my seat. Although in retrospect the end can be perceived as obvious, Johnson does such a great job leading the audience down different paths that even the obvious comes off as surprising.Daniel Craig's accent was a bit inconsistent, however that does not ruin the film at all. It is a must see for mystery fans - or film fans in general."
2336,"Knives Out is pitch-perfect indeed, inscribing itself in the annals as one of the best mystery movies of all time. Reminiscent of the board game Clue (referenced in the movie), the mansion where most of the film is set subconsciously creates an atmosphere of suspense itself, a suspense that is developed and deepened by the stunning chiaro-oscuro lighting.The actors play their roles beautifully, with an especially good performances from the grandfather (Christopher Plummer), the daughter (Jamie Lee Curtis) and of course the detective (Daniel Craig), whose accent starts out as forced but ends up contributing to the film's paradoxically whimsical nature.Finally, the writing is exceptional. As with any murder mystery, expect twists. Unlike any other murder mysteries these days however, expect to be genuinely taken by surprise.A particularly entertaining film and a must see!"
2337,"A fun, captivating whodunnit with some seriously hilarious moments. (the will reading had me in hysterics). chris evans clearly had fun transforming into a complete jerk. also, it feels so refreshing to watch a standalone movie in 2019. one teensy tiny itsy bitsy gripe i had was the continuity errors with ransom in the will reading scene?? i'm not knocking the overall movie but come on. i don't know if anyone else noticed, but stuff like that really irks me."
2338,Great cast. Looks to me like they were all enjoying making the film. A very nice whodunnit that keeps you guessing.
2339,"Brilliant film. Entertaining, serious, funny and captivating. Brilliant family film and a real deep plot with brilliant humour."
2340,"I loved the setting, the acting, the directing; however, what made the movie were the subtle references to likenesses the movie has to other concepts, examples: thank you for the scene from Murder She Wrote; Ransom's constant referral to Blanc's absurd accent; obscure movie references throughout; Toni Collette nailing the new age mother character (the voice!)."
2341,"Everyone likes it, critics praise it, me? well, yeah it's not bad. Agatha Christie thriller mystery set in today's world, with a little touch of leftist message, though Johnson actually mocked both sides of the political spectrum in throughout the story, the one thing that I actually found hilariously entertaining. Everyone did a good job on the roles they played, though I think Daniel Craig is out of his own character playing the relatively cheerful detective, because to me, he'll always be the deadly serious, womanizer 007 agent. The plot twist is unexpectable, some of the morals of the story are delivered well, and ended with what I would say (and think) describes Johnson's alignment regarding the world's issues (well you already can see it in his 2017's Last Jedi about that). So far not bad, but it's not too spectacular or mind-blowing to me, just good, which is enough."
2342,"I went to see this, at a second-run theater, expecting this to be the ""Dude, Where's My Car?' of murder mysteries. But, I actually found myself enjoying this! And I attribute that as much to the collective talents of the cast as the brains of the director (who, quite frankly, had a lot to make up for after SW:TLJ).First off, there were Daniel Craig and Christopher Plummer. Those two, of course, contributed greatly to the box office success of the Anglo-American remake of GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO. So, no, it doesn't surprise me that history repeated itself with this movie.Then, there's Jamie Lee Curtis and Don Johnson. She proves, here, that she can scream insults at (fictional) dysfunctional relatives as easily as she can scream in horrified distress at a machete-wielding impersonator of William Shatner. While he proves just as versatile at playing an unfaithful husband as he has at playing street-wise undercover cops and aging ex-hippie widowers in romantic comedies!Chris Evans, as H.R. Drysdale, is also surprisingly good at breaking away from his superheroic images as Johnny Storm and Captain America. While Frank Oz was initially unrecognizable, to me, as the Thrombey family lawyer. But, it's a credit to his non-Muppetry acting skills that he was even funnier in this role than he was as Yoda!Last but not least? Ana de Armas, as Marta, is a newcomer to me. But, she does a superb job of playing the courageous Latina nurse misguidedly carrying out the last request of a recently deceased patient. And, if I were as kind-hearted as Marta, I'd restrict my unselfishness to the only two Thrombeys who truly deserve it: Meg and Nana! The latter, as Harlan's mom, is a hundred years-old if she's a day. And, thus, she has very few alternatives left as to how she spends the rest of her life. While the former (though a little naive when it comes to life outside her ""green-collar"" family) is genuinely sincere in her egalitarian beliefs.In short, I was delightfully kept guessing from beginning to end. And I'm dead certain most everyone else who goes to see this will feel the same way."
2343,"""Knives Out"" is a 'who done it?' type of movie that follows the established conventions of the genre but it is also a lot more. Indeed it explores new ways to tell the story about the mystery and the solution of the murder that occurs. And I find this aspect so much entertaining because due to the unusual structure I was able to experience different types of anxiety and curiosity for a movie like this. And it has some funny moments too.
In this context Rian Johnson manages to explore some deeper themes like the importance of behave respecting the others and the main one that is about racism. These themes are not showed in a direct way but in a more metaphorical one that is not omnipresent at all and so they absolutely don't prevaricate the main mystery itself but enriches the story.
In conclusion I had a very great time watching ""Knives Out"", I was so much entertained and I look forward to re-watch it again!"
2344,"A clever, engaging whodunnit with some excellent performances.
I always thought Rian Johnson was a good director and this proves it.
He may have stuffed up Last Jedi with some poor choices and execution but he's back with a vengeance with this film.
Watch and enjoy."
2345,"Enjoyed the movie ~ well-written, good pacing and with enough plot twists to keep the viewer interest going. Daniel Craig plays the role of P.I. that is refreshingly far off from his usual suave 007 persona. The only gripe I had was the cast of supporting characters, though very interesting at the start, didn't have much chance to develop further in the film. But still, a job well done by Rian Johnson."
2346,Enjoyed the twists and turns! Such a fun ride full of outstanding performances. The storytelling was wonderful.
2347,"Wow, this movies is awesome. It feels like a tribute to Agatha Christhie.The cast is masterclass, the script and performances are hilarious and is very well directed. Had a fun time at the cinema and my dad loved it!."
2348,Good detective. Good twist(s). Good donuts (yum!). Good comedy. Good actors.I'll take this over Uncut Gems any day. Glad I watched this first.
2349,"It was gripping from start to finish and i found myself at the edge of my seat towards the end. Daniel Craig smashes the role as the detective even though i found his accent a little forced it was over ruled by his great acting. Heck! they all had great acting throughout.The ending? It was a great twist after an already great twist, i found it clever how the story made us feel one way about certain characters to then make us want to change our mind and then fooling us again.Although to be a bit of a critic, certain points of the movie were a little clichéd for plot convenience, it felt like the story started to convert into cheap ways to try and lay out the ending for us and part of it seemed desperate, leaped and shallow. I'm not contradicting my above praise for the movie i still think it was a great whodunnit just not.....a 10/10 more of an 8/10. Rian Johnson did a good job."
2350,Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I thought it was going to be a wacky B movie but it was pleasantly surprising! Recommending seeing this!
2351,The film will you leave you thinking and have you laughing at the same time.
2352,"I feel this movie deserves much credit for standing out and producing something new and unique. I really liked that the plot was well taught out and pays attention to detail.One example that i really liked was the explanation for when Martha chose the wrong medication bottle. Here Mr Blanc gave the explanation that she had taught herself through experience to know the difference between the different medication-liquids, and hence did therefore not look at the medical logo when choosing the bottle. Rather she subconsciously just took the right liquid by remembering the weight, colour or perhaps better explained as the ""feel"" of the liquid. I do believe this to be something that we do often in daily lives and found it to be a clever detail to introduce!The other clever detail i enjoyed was the logic Mr Blanc used when revealing that the conversation between Heugh and the father had steered over to Martha. The only natural explanation for the argument over the will to suddenly involve Martha, would be that she also has something to do with it."
2353,Good fun from beginning to end. Great cast all around and every character was perfect. Daniel Craig stood out with his accent which added to his character. Classic who dunnit that you don't see what's coming until it comes.
2354,"Calling all armchair detectives. Take a break from TV series such as Jonathan Creek, Death in Paradise and such like, and watch a movie with murder, motivation and marvelous twists and turns. Are you observant and savvy enough to work out who the killer is?Daniel Craig at his best. Funny, intriguing, and thought provoking. Keep you guessing right till the end...a must watch."
2355,Knives out is a hit. This was one of those movies that just happened to be one of the best films of 2019.
2356,"I enjoyed this movie. It was well crafted, excellently acted, and paced brilliantly. The story was twisty as expected and the dialog crisp. It keeps the audience tightly wound in suspense as to what's gonna happen next and that's the trait that separates a good mystery from a mediocre one. I can wholeheartedly recommend this flick."
2357,"Been wanting to see this movie for such a long time now, these types of mystery and suspenseful movies are not typically made anymore, that's why it's so fresh and why I think it was done in a great way. Storyline and the way everything was produced and directed was very well done. In a way, it had a dry sense of humor through lots of family arguments and ""Kentucky Fried Chicken"" Daniel Craig, but it was enjoyable to watch. Daniel Craig did a great job in this role, his accent was good but through the way he played his role, he made you seem that this guy was an incredibly smart investigator, then in the next scene you think, this guy may actually be an idiot, what is he doing. Right from the beginning you know this whole movie was about mystery, and in a way it was slow to begin with, but they were just laying down the lines for the story and trying to make the audience make conclusion about who did it. It was in a way predictable, having a big reveal in the end with Daniel Craig explaining every small movement that the murderer took in his actions and trying to cover himself up. But overall an entertaining movie that was suspenseful and made the audience draw conclusions about characters. I don't know how I would've liked the movie without Daniel Craig, he was a real showstopper."
2358,Here is another suspense film fun to watch and you'll stick on till the end of the film.
2359,Nice movie but for a person who loves crime shows and movies it would be a perfect movie if first they changed the background music and theme into something more dark instead of this Sherlock's Holmes theme. Second I didn't really like his Texan accent which I found unnecessary to be honest.
2360,"Great writing, great music, great humor. A bit of a lull in the middle of the movie, and some parts were predictable, but the bulk of the plot was a great ride."
2361,"This is quirky, funny, engaging, enjoyable and very well acted.From the moment the film opened, I was hooked and it didn't let go for a second. One of the best films of the year, perfect balance of intrigue and humour and the performances were absolutely spot on. It's pure enjoyment.I'm looking forward to watching this again and really recommend that everyone sees it. It should entertain everyone."
2362,"I liked the mood of this movie, all gloomy and mystical. The cinematography was impressive. I liked the pace, and I liked that the overall tone was refreshing while still staying true to the genre.
Martha was a bit annoying at first. I thought that she was the killer because she seemed suspiciously perfect, with all that ""no lying"" stuff. But I grew to like her very much by the end. I the ""You did not switch the bottles because you're a good nurse"" part was very nice to me, got a bit teary eyed there.
Overall, great movie, a breath of fresh air, would recommend."
2363,"After the trailers I was already curious. Today I saw the film - I just came from the cinema - and I am thrilled! The film is exciting, it is funny and it never gets boring."
2364,"Oh my god! This was actually a really good film! I saw it advertised on the side of a bus shelter and I had extremely low expectations. I went to see it with my friend, just expecting to see Daniel Craig being a detective in a average who dun it. I was so presently surprised! After about 45 minutes I was like ""how the hell are they gunna carry this on?!"" But they did so marvellously! The twist came, then another!! Absolutely stunning! This is only my 2nd IMDb review even tho I use it pretty much every day. This is an amazing film and actually really funny. The humour is subtle but I did laugh out loud a few times! Really really good !"
2365,"This movie was great. Didn't really have any expectations for it, but that made the ride even better. For starters, it had amazing performance from a really great cast. It was also nice that it had a humorous tone to it and it wasn't super serious. But the non stop plot twists that just kept coming and coming. But it never felt like to much. The way things unfold are very unique and you will not see anything coming."
2366,"ALL the characters were great, funny in their roles!!"
2367,"A thrilling film overall, from the amount of imagery it portrays to the precision of showing different plot points. The film made by Rian Johnson is visibly a outstanding 8/10, this is due to perfection in every way (Casting, overall acting, and the movie as a whole) the most recognizable performance in this film is not by Chris Evans or Christopher Plummer, it was by Daniel Craig who outstandingly portrayed a precise detective striving for a solution. If you are thinking that you should see this movie, without a doubt go see it!"
2368,"And I expected it to be a lot of fun. This movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and that's a great thing. Every person plays a critical role in moving the plot along and getting us to a truly satisfying conclusion. One of the most fun films I've seen in theaters in quite some time."

2370,"An out-and-out drama film: props tick, characters tick, colours tick, plot design tick, style tick, not losing one minute of viewers' attention, tick."
2371,Haven't seen anything quite like this for some time. This genre of movie I thought had been done to death. The trailer in my opinion was not that appealing to me personally but I went following some strong recommendations from friends and family. What can I say ? The film simply blew me away. The best film in its genre hands down. Brilliantly directed and acted by a ensemble cast who gelled perfectly. I didn't see any of it coming which in today's reveal all world was very nice. Liked all the cast. Big fan of Christopher Plummer and Daniel Craig however the entire cast in my opinion were all on par with each other. Rian Johnson does an amazing job with this one. Go see it and enjoy it. Money and time well spent.
2372,"It's so cool that the movie tends the viewers to seek out who did the kill,but at the end the the script was so twisted, it made the whole movie an unexpected plot
An great movie and a good plot"
2373,"""Knives Out"" is surprising in many ways. I just want to start off by saying that this was an enjoyable movie that doesn't get too serious, and also works on so many levels as a comedy. Everyone in this movie was cast perfectly. They all played the roles well and it made for one hell of a movie. Going into this movie, I was expecting it to be somewhat of an Agatha Christie novel-esque kind of mystery. I am surprisingly glad, to say that it wasn't like that. It was more of it's own movie, and that's something that lately, isn't seen in Hollywood. The story and the script were so well done that it makes me wish that more originality was present in movies. This year, it was scarce to see a successful movie that wasn't a sequel or based on an existing source material. I think that the box office and critical success of films like this one, should encourage more people to write original scripts and just take those chances. ""Knives Out"" defies any negative ideas about the murder-mystery genre and should be a film that isn't duplicated, but rather inspires others to give existing genres the twist they need in order to produce better movies."
2374,"It was so intense the hole time, you didn't know what to expect! It was the best movie I've watched in a really long time. I definitely recommend it."
2375,"Saying the film is predictable is not wrong, but it is missing the point. Just toward the first halves the film dropped plenty of clues toward pointing the suspect of the crime, but the point was not about ""who did it"", but ""how and why it was done."" Indeed, perhaps in the first half audience is intentionally misled to get the impression of typical murder mystery through Knives Out stylistic ""who did it"" fashion, but as the film goes it shows that there is more to it.If one pays attention to the details. audience have been invited to ask ourselves about the mystery of the process of the murder - on the continuously shaking legs and the barking dogs - and even the especially charming Daniel Craig asked us, almost invitingly, who really hired him and why? The twist and turn is not about the result; but the process.And doing that, Rian Johnson is still able to slip a neat ""moral of the story"", with a rather bittersweet moment when the truth is finally revealed. ""You're a good person who follows your heart"" might be one of the most repeatedly cliche, but taking a backdrop of distrust and money in a family drama, Johnson's words spoken through Craig's character with his characteristic accent made the delivery much more impactful. The slick cinematography and excellent music directing in the whole movie supports this perfectly paced murder mystery.There is a notable questionable holes that may push you from your suspension of disbelief, but still: a delightful Christmas story to end the year; Knives Out is one film I'd recommend to get you absorbed to its intricate details."
2376,"Brilliant cast. But the plot carries the film. Maybe a stay at home movie. Not cinema worthy, theres always a higher expectation leaving the sofa! I highly recommened this movie. Daniel craig is pure class. Everytime he steps out of 007's shadow, he nails it! Lots of bad reviews for this film, the genre itself is hard to crack, but this movie definetly did it. 1st time review on imdb pump me a like if you watched the movie based on my opinion thanks"
2377,"Bringing a Cluedo (Clue) game to the big screen and to a modern audience in 2019 may have seemed somewhat of a gamble for director Rian Johnson. With the (welcome) influx of superhero movies, big budget visual effects, snappy editing and dumbed down scripts - a film such such as Knives Out, presented in a cinematic style that reminds me of similar classics from yesteryear, just may have been too smart for a millennial audience...And whether they got it or not, the film has certainly proven to be one of this years finest and best Hollywood productions which I just loved!Honestly, I went in not expecting much - but those expectations quickly faded within the first ten minutes as I was sucked in to this hilarious murder mystery.With great performances from all involved, although Marta was my fave - as well as tons of little Easter eggs and nods to many inspirations before it, I couldn't say a bad thing about Knives Out and was so happy that my 16 year old son could experience such a great film on the big screen, so different to his usual viewings.A pleasure to watch and entertaining the whole way through, Knives Out could be in the top 3 for 2019..!"
2378,"I loved the movie but the big problem I had was that the maximum amount a paid care taker can be bequeathed is $50,000.Other than that it's a fantastic whodunit."
2379,"Such a good film that goes beyond expectations. The film resembles an Agatha Christie novel where the identity of culprit who committed the crime is unpredictable until the end of the film.If you enjoy watching murder mysteries, then THIS IS THE FILM FOR YOU!!!"

2381,"Great film, lots of details that tie it to 2019 (some political), but absolutely a great experience from beginning to end. I wouldn't try and see it a second time but it wholeheartedly enjoyed it and recommend that you go see it."
2382,"Outstanding story and fantastic cast!!! Everyone is perfectly good, especially Daniel Craig and that southern accent! He didn't move out, into his British, in any second. Totally wow!!! Chris Evans is out of his American Captain and has done his role charmingly great!!! It is good to see Don Johnson and if I may say, he looks the best of all. Jamie Lee Curtis as always is a lady. Toni Collette in every role surprisingly different and unique, as Michael Shannon also. Christopher Plummer whatever he is acting, he has that smart and insightful view. Ana de Armas fits into that role as it should be. What to tell more than it is worth every second and cent!!!"
2383,"Movie Knives Out by Director Ryan Johnson (Directed some episodes of my favorite show Breaking Bad) is a very different style of murder mystery . Murder of a rich and famous murder mystery books writer Harlan Thrombey(very pleasant Christopher Plummer )in his own room on his birthday is investigated by Benoit Blanc(superb Daniel Craig from skywalk and many fun movies). Whole family involves daughter Linda Drysdale 'daddy's girl'( Jamie lee Curtis from Halloween movies), her husband Richard(Don Johnson from Miami vice )&their good for nothing /parasite son Ransom(adorable Chris Evans from movie Cellular), Harlan's son Walt(strange role for Michael Shannon ), Walt's wife Donna(riki Lindhome from big bang theory) , strangely quiet grandson Arden and Harlan's daughter in law Joni (Toni Collette)&grand daughter Meg. And then there is 84yr old Harlan's mother Greatnana Wanetta who sits and watches the whole family and says only what is significantly important. Harlan's caregiver Marta Cabrera(excellent emotional display by Ana de Armas) presence adds a lot of humor to family conversation and also shows how little one knows about geography of South America... countries Brazil/Paraguay/Ecuador are mentioned by family members when they are talking about dad's help. Script is great . It was truly a delight to watch a murder mystery movie with great script, lighting, youthful energy of actors and grim conversations about siblings lack of trust and in want of dad's wealth.
Very enjoyable. Oscar worthy Direction and screenplay. Excellent Editing."
2384,Ohh man awesome movie an must watch!! James Bond has done a great job!!!
2385,"So skillfully crafted, so well directed and produced, this movie DESERVES a sequel"
2386,"The blood stain in the shoe makes no sense at all, just think about it, if the detective Benit Blanc has known that she had that stain since the begining of the story as he says at the end, don't you think he should, as a smart detective, have sent that to the lab to just delete doubts, i feel the movie sets it like a kind of strategy from him to keep the her trust (just my subjective theory), but he says he is and objective person, so, that for just the first view at least, objectively talking, makes no sense, because that could just completely affect the rest of the story and the treat to her (Rian, you could have just skipped any blood reaching Marta's body man, it wasn't completely necesary, but i suppose is maybe your angle, ok), though we can forgive that, (and that she didn't realized in all that time that she had a white shoe with a clear stain in it, so it's possible for her personality) and the tape disappearance (that it's maybe posible for the situation in which the Detective Elliott gave it to her distracted by the footprints in the mud) apart from that little trifles the movie is just amazing, thanks for reading humans."
2387,"I'm pleased to say that Knives Out confounded my expectations in the most surprising and joyous way possible. One of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at the cinema in a long time, it not only pays homage and slyly subverts the conventions of the murder mystery genre, but it also made me re-evaluate my opinion of writer-director Rian Johnson as an artist in his own right.After the drubbing he got over Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Johnson's reputation has been stuck in the quagmire somewhat, a name synonymous to fandom as arguably sabotaging a much loved franchise. Whilst this matter is debateable in of itself, Knives Out showcases how much of an ingenious and skilled auteur Johnson can be, even more remarkable when working within the confines of a relatively modest setting and budget. This minimalist approach allows Johnson to be experimental; free reign to carve a richer canvass of quirky characters and surprising red herrings, which serve to enhance the plot and character's motivations rather than undermine it.I do not know what decision making process went into Johnson being chosen as directing SW: TLJ. I believe half the time the studio finds a director who produced a movie, or series of movies, which offer a uniquely immersive experience, or have showcased a idiosyncratic interpretation for movie-making in general, and given them the unfair burden of helming a multi-million dollar project which is totally incompatible with their skillset.I have literally just finished watching Looper on TV, for the second time after originally watching it in the cinema, and I was staggered by the narrative and tonal similarities with Knives Out, in terms of how the story unfolds in a nicely convoluted yet inventively slight manner. Johnson has never given himself more than what's he's needed in order to create his vision, EXCEPT with the notable exception of SW: TLJ, and therein my point is concluded.Johnson's audaciousness and prerogative to subvert expectations works so well when he's focused on a stand-alone project which he's conceived from the get-go, but taking responsibility for a tentpole movie which is a) expected to adhere to the conventions of the franchise/genre, b) please its die-hard fanbase, and c) fit in nicely with a gazillion dollar Disney gravy train; he was almost doomed to fail right from the start. That's just not Johnson's style, and the studio should've realised that.This is not to say I'm going to re-evaluate SW: TLJ as some sort of overlooked masterpiece. Far from it! It still has problems, quite a few in fact, but you want someone who's going to toe the party line, not an individual who does things his or her own way. To this end I believe that Johnson has suffered unfairly, purely because of the studio's naivety.But anyway, back to the movie...The way in which Knives Out unfurls in front of our very eyes is a masterclass in misdirection and cracking entertainment. The narrative is created purposely to focus the viewer on the here and now; to not let their minds wander. You hinge on every word and action. You could almost accuse the movie as being episodic with its shifting focus of multiple character strands, were they not interweaved together so delicately by Johnson's deft touch, and the enthusiastic portrayals by the ensemble cast at his disposal.Indeed, it's difficult to know where to start with a cast so large and talented. As with most movies with a multitude of big names, a lot of actors fade into the background, merely there to draw in the crowds while not actually contributing or enhancing the viewing experience. Knives Out, on the other hand, is a very different story.Each and every cast member lends their own personality to the piece, with passion and gusto. You could tell everybody was having a lot of fun making this movie, as Johnson's given them a lot of rich material to draw from and make their own. There seemed to be an overriding, and palpable, chemistry between the actors which meant you totally believed their relationships and motivational self-interests.With a canvas this large you'll forgive me for not singling out any specific names, however I must give special mention to of course Daniel Craig and Ana De Armas, the latter a revelation in her non-showy but memorable performance as a timid yet strong-willed caregiver, integral to the plot. In many ways she carries the movie, as the viewer is aligned with her from the very start, and she's the prism through which we see the infighting and breakdown of the Thrombey dynasty. To pull this off with a degree of believability, and more fundamentally likeability, required an actress who could showcase a series of subtle yet telling emotions to which the audience relates and understands. The fact De Arnas is a relative novice to the movie industry, with little opportunity to flex her acting muscles beforehand, makes her casting all the more inspired.Craig, though, is an absolute delight and hoot as the private detective tasked with solving the case. His exaggerated deep southern accent and clichéd powers of deduction lend themselves greatly towards the eccentricities of the movie, and serve to enhance his character's affability and larger-than-life demeanour. Craig is definitely revelling in chewing the scenery (or probably more apt, furnishings) at every opportunity he gets.As for the supporting cast, I actually considered Lakeith Stanfield to be a perfect level-headed foil for Craig's more rambunctious character, and it was nice to still see Christopher Plummer in the spotlight with a tender, and affectionately wacky, portrayal of the family patriarch.Knives Out has its twists and turns at every corner, and dares the audience into questioning what they're seeing in front of their very eyes. Nothing is ever as straightforward as it seems, and Johnson is never satisfied with settling for a by-the-numbers and generic whodunit. He chooses to keep us delightfully bewildered and encapsulated with a cracking rollercoaster of a movie which is literally fun for the whole family!"
2388,"Imagine if Alfred Hitchcock adapted an Agatha Cristie novel. This was my thinking walking out of the theater. Based upon a look at some other reviews, mine is not an isolated thought.
There are a number of great individual performances, tied together by a great overall production."
2389,"This was a fantastic film! A classic, your mind wandering to every single detail. This film was certainly a memorable one, hilarious as well."
2390,There are so many plot twists! One of the best murder mysteries I've ever watched.
2391,"This movie might be in my top 5 of the year, definitely top 10 though. It was funny, wasn't confusing, and was just subtle enough to keep those who may not catch on as fast engaged with the rest of us. Movie didn't even feel as long as it was."
2392,"The Cast weren't trying too hard to act. They were all exceptionally great especially Daniel Craig.
The Plot was simple yet interestingly complicated at the same time. Every passing minute aroused your interest to see what's gonna happen next."
2393,"I changed my rating to 9. You may ask why?
Simple in the last years I went to so many movies and I just was bored or I liked it but friends we're disappointed.Knives out was good entertainment and value for the money. It is funny, clever and till the end interesting.In a nice way a old school murder detective story.It has a great cast, ok Mr Craig's accent is some what funky, but it works. Chris Evans was a great cast for the role of Ransom, just not sure if it was good acting or just good casting.In short I liked the movie a lot."
2394,"Knives Out lacks the most original story, however its fantastic character moments and effortlessly fun direction keeps you intrigued for its 2 hour running time."
2395,Excellent film! I didn't know what to expect but thankfully this was a superb film with a great script and acting.
2396,Very good time for watch the film lm very happy then lm watch hm also he different movie other the movies
2397,"Starting with the cast, everyone fits perfectly for their role especially Steve Rogers. Coming to the story line it was kind of suspense and comedy at times, which didn't bore me at all through out the movie. It is a must watch."
2398,Story wasn't too unique and becomes more and more predictable as it progresses. But I also think rating it less than 8 would be unfair.
2399,Knives Out is a captivating and thrilling mystery drama and was a joy to see. The movie starts and for the first ten minutes was not at all interesting then the real mystery kicks in and the movie goes from a 2 to a 4 Star in an instant. Daniel Craig's accent in this movie is my only complaint as it was annoying and unauthentic in parts. The main characters are funny and entertaining throughout and give you a truly enjoyable cinema experience. Chris Evans' character makes you laugh at his sick and twisted jokes and really bumps the movie up a notch with his inclusion. Knives out is the perfect movie to watch if you want to test your brain. My advice going into the movie is listen carefully.
2400,"To be honest this is an incredible movie.
It is actually very mind twisting for me and even my friends thought it. When i exited the theatre i said to myself ""What the hell just happened"" but at the same of me saying that i said that it has been the first murder mystery film to confuse the hell out of me.definitely recommend if you are interested in the Mystery genre of movie.Daniel Craig surprised me the most because of his effort he put in the movie and his acting. This is the first Daniel Craig movie I've seen so id love to see other ones as well after this.
Many twists that happened in the movie jumbled up my mind so much i forgot what was happening in the movie.Anyways this is an easy 9/10"
2401,"This movie is everything you could ask it to be. It is a mystery that in spite of telling you how it happened pretty early on, keeps the tension going by expanding how and why everything happens, with twists that are incredibly hard to predict. The acting is great, and Daniel Craig represents an imposing, but at times comedic detective.
I came to see this movie expecting the all-star cast to be front and center, mainly because of the marketing campaign, but I was pleasantly surprised by the role given to Ana de Armas.
I would highly recommend this movie to everyone."

You are left constantly guessing or believing you know what's going on throughout the movie as much or more than any brilliant mystery. The way in which you are taken on this journey is unlike anything I've ever experienced and that's where this movie truly shines... the perspective is utterly enjoyable and fresh! The storytelling flows perfectly and feels natural. Every shot is done deliberately and with such taste. I found myself getting lost in the cinematography paired with the score several time and was please to do so. This movie is the most fun I had in the movie theater in 2019. Simply amazing."
2403,"I loved everything in this movie, the cast,the plot,the scenarios... I'm not a big fan of murder mystery because there are a lot of characters and a lot of connections between them to remember, but in this movie they're easy so it stiked in my mind easily.I really recommend this movie, not only for murder mystery fans but for everyone, because it's a really good movie."
2404,"Some great talent and good jobs done across the board.This is a genre that's been done before. Many genres done before. Never felt it so obvious and agitating than when I saw ""The Irishman."" And I felt it with this, although it didn't bother me so much.The characters have been seen before in very close proximity to these. Almost cliche. But real people across the board are repetitive and cliche, too.One element bothered me, though. The blood test of the corpse. I know these characters are under pressure and don't think straight. But I'm not under pressure and I see these things when they come up.The be-all and end-all of the blood work getting out didn't rest with that one sheet of paper. They could be done again. They were likely in a database. Now these characters might not have thought of that. But it's true.And then the nurse Marta is confronted by Chris Evans to tell the truth or she will vomit. ""So tell me."" Logic would dictate that she would then say nothing as she was not under any obligation to say anything, even for optics like in the initial interviews. But she did.And the final scene's PAYOFF was very good...but the set-up made little sense. Specifically when Chris Evans went after Marta and plunged the knife into her chest...but with a retractable blade.Very funny! But why would that art piece of many knives have a retractable blade? And most of the knives on it clearly were not such due to the shapes.But very enjoyable nonetheless. Hope you're reading this AFTER you've seen it, though."
2405,"Why no one dares to give this film ten stars?
There are literally no flaws in this film.
It attends everything, and even more of what you can expect from it.Ana de Armas leading the movie like no other is first great plot twist. perfect.
Daniel Craig, Toni Collette, Michael Shannon... Come on. Basically everyone excelled their acting... How do you obtain such outstanding precision in performance and dialogue?Rian... Rian, you genius son of a coffee mug. Sweater sucker. You are the answer to that. To all of that. The answer to all of hollywood. From the inside you are showing them what originality is, how it's properly done in all levels.In all levels because the film attends, and which is my favourite aspect of the film, the level about Marta and his position against the one from the family. That -side by side with the final fake knife, which condensed everything in it, and was incredible- are the most important events of the film.And then... The closing shots. Whilst playing Sweet Virginia (and which I always thought it was a great song for ending a film). That, really murder with the biggest knife any doubt I could possibly have with this film.I suspected foul play. But no, I eliminated every suspicion and the case is closed: This films deserves all your ten stars."
2406,"What a great 'old fashioned' movie. This is a movie for old movie lovers. Phenomenal cast, portrayals, 100% believable and the perfect setting. Really everyone was spot on in their performance which is rare. They really did feel like a dysfunctional family...this movie is so believable you think that right now Marta is doling our the inheritance to the family. Classic performances and lovely to see the actors play unconventional(ish) roles because they really proved themselves (not that they needed to.) Such a rarity. I would love to see this again and again."
2407,"What a great film, and a refreshing change from the types of films we see nowadays
I was riveted from the very beginning, acting was of course superb- but no surprises there with a cast like this
However what the writers did, was expand on a basic theme, of what happens when people die. From my own experience and association with others, the family gets split by an irrational greed and an attitude of self entitlement. This film explored that brilliantly and is as much a documentary on the psychology of relationships, as a great 'who Dunnit' film.Anyway for those that like films that keep you guessing, this is the best I have seen in years"
2408,"Johnson recieved a lot of fall out for his treatment of The Last Jedi, but after seeing Knives Out, I have to say that he has exonerated himself from any judgements toward his ability to direct or tell a fresh, gripping story. The plot of Knives Out is original and new, told at a fast pace (although the film itself is a 2 hour slow burn), full of amazing performances, twists and turns, and tight dialogue. Daniel Craig delivers a memorable performance as the Private Eye, although I found his affected southern accent to be a bit distracting at times. Knives Out was worth the price of admission as well as a strong reccomendation to anyone who enjoys a good mystery that will truly keep you guessing."
2409,Everything flowed perfectly in this film Daniel Craigs acting and voice work was perfected
2410,"Those who like a good ""whodunit"" will enjoy this. Starts slow but stick with it. Funny, witty, smart, great plot and acting. Highly entertaining whodunit with a necessary plot twist."
2411,"A star-studded murder mystery, unpredictable and extremely funny. Perfectly written and masterfully acted, took us back to a simpler time when words and conversation are satisfying to watch."
2412,"This feature film is surprisingly fun, funny, intense & brilliant. The cast is perfectly chosen, the surprise of Daniel playing a fuddy duddy, Jamie Lee's fabulous ambition, Toni's single yummy Mum and much more greatly timed insight, wit and shock. The ask is: We want MORE :)"
2413,"Great fun, awesome cast. Definately worth your time and money."
2414,"Having endured his own knives out moment with ""Star Wars"" fans...director Rian Johnson returns to a fun romp through Agatha Christie route. The mysterious death of a patriarch that reveals family dynamics. At the center is an ""anchor baby"" nurse whose adorable naivete of the wealthy actually helps her navigate the bickering within. Though, at times, soaring with twist and turn...if you've seen enough of these, some of it is fairly obvious. But Daniel Craig adds a bit of buoyancy with, what I can only describe as Kentucky Fried Hercule Poirot...it's truly the journey.
A fun evening watch during the holidays with family when fractured politics and nerves get you all down. It holds a mirror to being just a good person without all the bad blood turn to poor choices in life."
2415,"From Agatha Christie to Clue, the whodunnit is a classic form, and has been interpreted and reinterpreted in cinema for generations. But Rian Johnson's take on it manages to celebrate what makes that legacy so enduring while also bringing the form kicking-and-screaming into the 21st century. It's a masterstroke from a filmmaker who has just been getting better and better with each film."
2416,"Harlan Thrombey is a successful novelist and publisher who throws a party inviting his immediate family to attend. The familial gathering turns out well until situations unravel and matters get out of hand. ""Knives Out"" is a fun suspense comedy that lifts its style from vintage mysteries and adeptly places it in a modern setting. The all-star cast shines as Christopher Plummer, Don Johnson, Daniel Craig, Jamie Lee Curtis, Chris Evans and the rest of the cast bring out their respective roles as the characters involved who try to get their wits together for their own ends. Humor permeates throughout and Daniel Craig navigating through his Southern drawl just wins. And Ana de Armas' comely doe-eyed innocence is endless eye candy. The ending is as unexpected as it is delightful. With a topnotch script and everything you want in a movie that works this rib-tickling glimpse into the wild and wacky ways of the rich is a lively romp intriguing its way to the viewer's glee. Comedy of the year."
2417,"No spoilingThe movie is well done. Actors are great. The story is awesome. There are a lot of evidences.The final is superlative and is there where as all ""yellow movies"" you get in. Typical Agata Christy style but this time is depicted in America.But as usual the spectator has all the tools and the info to get the truth before the end. Follow the scenes, the details, the dialogues and you get it.A very good movie that I suggest to watch at the cinema."
2418,"This film became very attractive before release as soon as they announced the cast, and it did not disappoint. The cast make the characters very likable and the film wouldn't be as good without them.The first half of this film appears to be a classic murder mystery, but then it takes a big twist. Because of this twist we are lead to believe that the majority of the movie, there is no murderer. But then takes another turn and it turns out there is. Coming to the conclusion of the movie when revealing the killer, multiple twists happen again.You are lead to doubt yourself the whole movie as it could take a turn at any moment, which makes it so entertaining. It did not feel like a normal murder mystery."
2419,What a terrific fun movie that kept me fully engaged - despite Daniel Craig's ridiculous southern accent.
2420,Great to watch. Make us guessing in every single time
2421,"After watching the trailer I was not very sure what to expect but that made it a bigger surprise. First of all it is highly above average quality in todays movies. In addition if an actor can make you forget he is James Bond in the first seconds on a screen he is a pretty good actor, and that's what Daniel Craig does in this movie. Everyone is just perfect, what an incredible amount of talent. To sum up, just González watch it. It is one of those little gems we seldom find among the usual blockbusters."
2422,"Dont let the debacle of the Last Jedi fool you into not seeing this masterpiece movie. I love a good crime/mystery movie and Knives Out exceeded expectations and was fun to follow B. Blanc's investigation and Marta's journey through the twists and turns. Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas were amazing in this and thats not to discredit the rest of the amazing cast, they all performed very well and pulled you into the story.Director and Writer of Knives Out, Rian Johnson really showed the world just what he can do. Im less worried and more intrigued at what his rumored Star Wars movie will be about. Maybe it was because it he was tethered to an ongoing trilogy and just needed to be given a standalone film to run free. Im truly excited for what he does next."
2423,"Knives Out is a masterpiece, a mistery film influenced by Agatha Christie and Arthur Conan Doyle works. Daniel Craig is perfect playing his role a modern Sherlock Holmes. Ana de Armas is a great actress playing a lovely character. Jamie Lee Curtis is wonderful playing Linda, always with an amazing acting role putting a special touch to her character. Toni Collette's character is a delight, great performance. Chris Evans is a good actor, playing a different role not related to his last films. Knives Out is terrific, direction, production, script, score, art direction and post-production all is perfect. Even the film talks about the actual presidential administration and the different thoughts between the American people and the divided United States about good and sensitive people against rude people hating foreign persons, obviously the lead family is divided like the country, Ana de Armas' character is the victim a latin american nurse from an undefined latin american country. The mistery and turns in the script are awesome with funny moments and scenes. Knives Out is a must see, a perfect candidate for the Oscars' nominations."
2424,"Really good movie! Just wish there had been a few more twists and turns, because some it felt a little predictable. But overall really good cast and acting!"
2425,"One of my favorite movies of the year by far.
Rian Johnson truly delivered and fantastic, thrilling, and suspenseful film that keeps the audience engaged right up until the very end.
Witty writing and great direction that come full circle once all the puzzle pieces fit and makes the audience let out an audible ""aha!"".The set and set pieces themselves give this movie a feeling of watching a game of Cluedo unfold and right from the get go you're carefully watching and listening to every detail.The cast is wonderful as well. Though not every character is major, every performance brings something to the entire movie with no one really giving off the feeling of not having to be there. Daniel Craig is obviously a stand out and every moment that he's on screen is a treat. Channeling a southern accent and being this perceptive and almost cartoonish private detective make his performance really something I was not expecting from Craig but it was wonderful to watch.The movie makes it seem that everything is already solved from the very beginning and the game has only just begun and the mystery only deepens as the movie until it eventually unravels.Rian Johnson truly deserves this success after the backlash received after Star Wars. If you love charming mystery, with a great cast, really witty and even funny dialogue that all ties into the story, then this movie won't let you down."
2426,More Agatha Christy and in her style a very well laid out whodunit. Got to admit it had me guessing till the end.
2427,"First Hit: An enjoyable investigative romp with a group of very capable actors in an old fashion story.This film reminded me of an old fashion crime drama, sort of like a ""Clue"" game. What makes this movie work is the way these capable actors tell this tale of crime and deceit in both a comedic and dramatic way.Marta Cabrera (Ana de Armas) is an in-home nurse who has also befriended her only client, Harlan Thrombey (Christopher Plummer). Harlan is very wealthy from writing eighty successful mystery novels. His health is failing, hence the need for Marta. Marta has become his only true confidant because the rest of the family, except his daughter Linda Drysdale (Jamie Lee Curtis), totally lives off his generosity.Linda and her husband Richard (Don Johnson) live in Harlan's home and don't fully escape from Harlan's largeness because he funded Linda's successful real estate business. They have a son Hugh Ransom Drysdale (Chris Evans), who is arrogant, flippant, and smart while living off an allowance from Harlan.Harlan's home is large and his mother, Great Nana (K Callan) lives with him. She doesn't talk and sits in a wheelchair throughout the film but plays an important role in the story. Other family members who are living off Harlan's wealth and success include; Walt Thrombey (Michael Shannon), his wife Donna (Riki Lindhome) who run Harlan's publishing company. Joni Thrombey (Toni Collette) who is Harlan's deceased son Neil's wife, and their daughter Meg (Katherine Langford), who receive an allowance from Harlan for Meg's schooling. Each of them are taking advantage of Harlan and during the film's story, each of these ways are explored more fully.The family has gathered to celebrate Harlan's 85th birthday. During this party, most of the family, we learn, have discussions with Harlan about his largeness towards them.The next morning, after the party, the housekeeper Fran (Edi Patterson) finds Harlan dead in his study with his throat slit, it appears to be a suicide.However, someone has anonymously hired Benoit Blanc (Daniel Craig) a famous southern investigator to find out if it was murder or suicide. Blanc, working with the police, begin to unravel the mystery as to why Blanc was hired to be involved.The police are convinced it was suicide, but the extraordinary questioning skills of Blanc and his inquisitive mind of solving puzzles begins to shed a different light on Harlan's death. Slowly, and methodically, his interviews begin to piece a different story together.One of the funnier parts of the interviewing process by Blanc, we learn that Marta cannot lie. If she lies, she throws up. There are a couple hilarious, slightly gross, scenes of this.When the lawyer comes and the Will is read, everyone gathers to find out that Harlan has left everything, I mean everything, to Marta. The family doesn't know what to do, or how they will survive, or do they?Craig is hilariously fantastic as the investigator Benoit Blanc. His slow southern drawl and idiosyncrasies, during the interviews using the piano, are spot on funny and pointed. Evans is perfect as the conniving Ransom. His ability to be both charming and evil are perfect. Armas is sublime as Marta. Her expressions of the fear of doing something wrong, her caution because having a mother who is illegally in the country, and also wanting to do the right thing for Harlan are excellent. Curtis is outstanding as the daughter who wants more. Shannon is terrific as the son who thinks he's in charge of Harlan's business but really is just a pawn. Collette is perfectly flighty and conniving as the social influencer and thief in the name of her daughter Meg. The rest of the cast is equally good in making this a wonderful romp. Rian Johnson wrote and directed this fun filled mystery and got the best out of everyone for their roles.Overall: This was a perfect, fun filled, and enjoyable movie to sit through."
2428,"I went into this movie with very few expectations, as I'm not usually a fan of the mystery genre. However, I found this movie to be excellent.
The thing I enjoyed the most was that the plot was unpredictable and engaging. I spent a large part of the movie speculating what would happen next, only to be thrown for a loop. That was thrilling, and it really felt like I was a part of the film!
Second, the character development was so well done (as it should be for a murder mystery). The actors did a fantastic job of portraying the depth of each individual, while simultaneously weaving a bigger picture that incorporated them all.
Third, the use of light/sound/angles contributed and emphasized the mystery of the film.
If you are a fan of Agatha Christie's murder mysteries or just looking for a few hours of entertainment, you will love this film! Highly recommend it!"
2429,"I've not enjoyed a movie like this for quite a while, truly enjoyable. The cast are spectacular, and the main lead plays the character very well. Bravo."
2430,"Well acted, scripted... fun for all the mystery lovers out there. However I had ONE issue that came to mind, a while after I returned home from the movie. I would've given it a perfect 10 otherwise.After the injection incident, Harlan carefully plotted an elaborate exit strategy for Marta which would take him at least 10 minutes to explain. He would've died within that time frame if the medical explanation held true. BUT he didn't die... should he wait another while before ending his own life? He would've realized everything was FINE with him afterall. But then again, the movie wouldn't have been made. My bad..."
2431,"The cast, the story, the script, the cinematography, all top notch absolutely amazing. One of the best movies I've watched in a long long time. The movie lives up to the hype of its cast."
2432,"Wow...just wow. Could not fault it in anyway, you'd think it may be a bit boring or a remake of clue, but it's something else. Daniel Craig's character is simply sublime."
2433,"Fun and full of twists, just as it should be..."
2434,"A spooky old house, an untimely death, a surprising will, & quirky, greedy family! All the elements of a great mystery. This film is full of twists & turns that deliver an entertaining adventure!
Near perfect."
2435,"We went with friends to see this clever film and all enjoyed it. It's a great holiday film, with a terrific cast. The acting was a little over the top, nevertheless appropriate to the film. They seemed to have fun with their parts. It's a tongue in cheek take on a Christie type detecting story, with enough false clues to everyone wondering. We loved the set decorations... not something one always notices, but the props, the building, the spookiness added to the fun. And then there was Daniel Craig's affected accent... a character all of it's own.I wish there were more films like being made like this... it entertained all of us, with differing tastes."
2436,"I love movies with good characters, good plot points, stories to tell and reasons for telling you stories. I've never been so disappointed by a story, movie or director to sign up to write a review on IMDB and say how do we change this BS. I would give a 0 if it as an option. How do we give a voice to good story tellers?"
2437,"After the movie, there is just very pleasant afterthought."
2438,"I am somebody that loves murder mystery movies, pretty much have all Agatha Christie movies with Perot (70s version of Murder On the Orient Express was my Favorite), pretty much when I see a Sherlock Holmes movie, I am there.This has been my most anticipated movie this year, went in with far higher hope then you should, with there being a chance of disappointment if it did not reach them, and still this movie blew me away.The actors all did an amazing job, those that needed to be arrogant, two faced, angry, hateful, or just plain good person hit their mark throughout.This was full of famous actors and actresses, but amazingly the movie needs one of it's youngest and newest actresses Ana de Armas to drive the movie, and she does one of the best jobs in a movie where you can't say enough of each actor and actress. Jamie Lee Curtis, Don Johnson, Daniel Craig, Chris Evens, Christopher Plummer, Michael Shannon, Toni Colette and everyone else are all sensational.Movie is funny, shocking, emotional, and suspensful whenever it wants to be, and easily has THE BEST MURDER MYSTERY MOVIE REVEAL I have ever seen...even better then my now 2nd favorite Mystery Movie, Murder on the Orient Express.I do not want to give any spoilers, or clues away, so I will just say this movie is so much fun, you will laugh, and be held to the very end on the edge of your seat wondering what really is going."
2439,"Even though the movie takes place into this house for the most of its duration, it wont make you feel tired or bored. Not even for a single second. The plot is so smart and funny and the acting is so marvelous that will keep your eye and thought fully sharped. Of course the finale is not easily predictable, but is completely relatable with the story and the familiar personas. No random side roles to answer the ""whoddunit"" question.
Totally recommended whether you're a mystery lover or not.
P.L"
2440,"I'm glad Rian Johnson had the chance to come back to very much his own story after the Star Wars VIII controversy. While I enjoyed his take on the franchise, there are many who don't seem to want fresh takes (at least in the main saga). Knives Out certainly delivered the film I'd been waiting for since the Last Jedi; the next new thing Johnson was working on. It certainly borrows various visuals and general ideas from classic murder mysteries (Poirot and the like), it unfolds quite differently as a movie, which works in its favour for sure. I don't want to say much at all for fear of spoilers, but I will say that the characters (both in casting and in their interactions with one another) bring this film to one of the best of the year. Watch it!"
2441,"Stellar performances from an ensemble cast with insane on-screen chemistry, great direction, and a whodunit for our times, Rian Johnson's Knives Out is one of 2019's best with some wholly relevant story about family and politics.Boasting a talented cast, it goes without saying Knives Out wouldn't be a spectacular triumph if not for the three leads of Daniel Craig, Chris Evans, and Ana de Armas. Evans, playing Hugh ""Ransom"" Drysdale, is a ridiculous mixture of unlikable and smoothness. Craig, playing Benoit Blanc, is hilarious as a detective with a thick southern accent. Armas, playing Marta Cabrera, grounds the film through her warmhearted portrayal of Marta's honest, firm, and ultimately good character. The rest of the cast do not disappoint and give dynamite performances of the fewer screen time they receive which includes Christopher Plummer, and Jamie Lee Curtis, to name a few.Central to Knives Out is the death of the family's patriarch, Harlan Thrombey, but the film is truly about a dysfunctional family and a satire about wealth and inheritance. Though Knives Out seemingly reveals Harlan's killer even before the finale, the writing uses the early reveal as a springboard for exploring the family dynamics between the Thrombeys and Marta, showing how each of the Thrombeys are inherently selfish despite their good front. When the will reading shockingly reveals that Harlan left his entire possessions to Marta, the Thrombeys immediately turn on her, except Ransom, and their true attitude is revealed by calling her names and making unfounded accusations of unduly influencing Harlan's will. This is exemplified by previous dialogues hinting that Marta is a mere afterthought to the family such as when individual Thrombeys claim they wanted her to be present at the funeral but were outvoted and not knowing her true country of origin. Through the whirlwind of losing not only an employer but a close friend and family by choice, Marta grows from a demure and devoted nurse to the strong and caring heir of Harlan's possessions.Knives Out isn't the traditional whodunit were the identity of the murderer is clear only in the end. Multiple faints, clues, and surprises makes Knives Out unique in the genre by seemingly throwing out the central mystery, when in actuality each scene is made for characters to grow. The journey, and the not the end, is basically the film's overarching thought. The complexity of the script requires repeat viewings because the hefty themes and minute character is buried underneath the murder mystery. When the ending reveals that Harlan caused his own death, though instigated by Ransom, that moment gives better clarity to the family dynamics explored by the film. People feel entitled to inheritance and will do anything to claim them.Rian Johnson is at home in Knives Out. Everything about the direction is firing on all cylinders. The film shifts from recollection to plot progression seamlessly. Not a second is wasted or feel dragging. Setting the film in a mansion evoking old money adds visual representation to the themes. The cinematography and music are also topnotch.Not only is Ana de Armas insanely beautiful, but talented as well. Hoping to see her in bigger and better roles. Lastly, give us more of Daniel Craig southern accent roles!10/10"
2442,"I went alone by myself in cinema this night. My impresions: It kept me interested and excited through hole story, plot is really twisted and the end is really impressive tho!My best recommendations!"
2443,"Good storytelling.
sense of humor.
excited ending.
you can feel ur heart beats faster.
describes human instinct very nicely."
2444,"The cast was superb, and the cinematography and production were great. It was hilarious and the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. I loved it."
2445,"I'm so glad I went to see that movie, absolutely a must watch, and take your friends they're gonna love it."
2446,"This is by far the best movie of 2019 and better than any other movie in the past 5 years. It keeps you guessing perfectly the whole movie and is a fun ride the whole time. A must see for any fan of movies, especially if you like murder mystery movies."
2447,Fantastic movie! Far better than your average murder in mystery. Many twists and turns that keep you on the edge of your seat.
2448,This is an intelligent and witty version of Cluedo in film that is entertaining throughout. The cast are tremendous especially Daniel Craig depicted as a Southern American detective hired to crack the case. The ending was also unpredictable which for this day in age is an achievement.
2449,"This movie is a jewel in the crown of great mainstream 2019 cinema. So funny and everyone does a marvelous job with their characters Don Johnson's having a nice year between this and The Watchmen,Toni, Michael, and Jamie Lee do fantastic as usual!) For me though the stars were Daniel Craig and Chris Evans; Craig's accent alone is a feat (those brits r so talented when it comes to American accents) plus his ""donut monologues are memorable. Evans is more than a Marvel character and I hope this film reiterates that. This is a film I will own when it's released on blu ray because I'm compelled to continue to watch it."
2450,"This movie is a brilliant blend of stellar acting, cheeky humor, and intrigue. A Clue game brought to life, and not sparing an ounce of drama or delight.Given the genre, you know there's going to be a few twists. The delight comes from trying to figure out how and when the twists will be delivered, and seeing how on or off the mark you were at predicting them. Engaging until the end."
2451,Okay so the trailer says 'perfect family film' okay well this is i not so if you take young kids youll find out in about 5 to 10 minutes of the movie you made a big mistake the movie is marvelous dont get me wrong i laughed i love the drama excitement everything to do with it just dont listen to the trailers
2452,"Fully packed with excitement, wonderful cast, very interesting script, full of humours, and sarcastic. Though it's not entirely type of Sherlock Holmes movie, but the thrilling and mysterious enough to hold the audience attached to the screen. And surprisingly funny, with a satisfied twist at the end. Good people deserves to win."
2453,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Knives Out has been shown in numerous festivals, and it received massive acclaim in literally every single one of them. Therefore, its hype grew more and more until its wide release date. Before the film, I can't deny that I was indeed affected by the whole ""a whodunnit like you haven't seen in years."" I went into the theater with high expectations, not only due to the festival praise but due to its jaw-dropping cast. It's uncommon to possess such a renowned ensemble and deliver a ""bad"" movie, especially when Rian Johnson is writing and directing it (yes, I like The Last Jedi, and even if I didn't, he did other stuff, you know?). It's one of those films everyone knows it's going to be appreciated by a considerable part of the world.Even the genre itself is a very welcome type of cinema entertainment in regards to both critics and the general public. So, does it live up to its hype, or it fails to reach such high expectations? Knives Out is one of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the best mystery-suspense stories of the millennium (everyone is doing the whole ""best X of the decade,"" I'm going one step beyond). This is a film I know I'm going to rewatch countless times throughout the next years. Usually, when it comes to whodunnits, people are misled into thinking that from the moment they know who ""did it,"" the movie loses its interest. This is rarely true, and Rian Johnson succeeds because he doesn't need the ultimate reveal to deliver a great story.This screenplay is definitely getting tons of nominations and wins during the awards season. Every little line of dialogue means something. Every single character says or does something impactful to the narrative (except for Jaeden Martell's). It's been half-a-day since I've seen it, and for every question that my brain comes up with, there's an answer lying on someone's words or actions. It's such an intricate, complex, extremely subtle script. One with so many tiny, little details that it's impossible to catch them all on a first viewing.I genuinely love the first act, even if it's the one where I have a minor issue. Rian Johnson doesn't waste time and puts us directly in the crime scene, interviewing each and every member of the family. It's through these interrogatories that he cleverly introduces the suspects, developing them solely through masterfully written dialogue, and outstanding performances. For example, with a single sentence and a particular body/face expression, Toni Collette instantly creates a profile of Joni, her character. Rian plays with character-types and cliches in such an intelligent manner. He makes us think a particular character follows a specific cliche, then it doesn't, then it does again...That's one of the reasons I couldn't figure out the mystery until the last act reveal. Every time I was close to indeed follow the right path, new developments arise, meant to mislead, confuse, and create doubts. Some people feel better with themselves if they solve the case before the film. They feel ""intellectually superior"" just because they found out before everyone else. First of all, I prefer being fooled and end up blown away by an unexpected conclusion than solving the whole thing way before time's up and end up disappointed and bored. Then, honestly, anyone who says, ""I guessed it,"" there's a 99% chance that they're either lying or not answering correctly to the question ""who killed Harlan?"" If you've seen the movie, you'll understand what I'm trying to express.(I don't want to sound presumptuous or hypocritical. I'm not trying to say, ""I couldn't figure it out, so no one can."" Please, if you haven't seen the film, judge the previous paragraph after your viewing.)Throughout the second and third acts, loose ends start to tie up, ending up with a brilliantly delivered reveal. From the marvelous cinematography (with those classic close-ups when a character is about to say something meaningful or tell a story through their imagination or memory) to the remarkable editing, the team behind Rian Johnson did a phenomenal job. The suspense is held at high levels, and it reaches limit-breaking points with Marta Cabrera's (Ana de Armas) narrative. Armas and Daniel Craig deliver the standout performances, with Chris Evans (Ransom) following right behind. Literally, everyone else offers excellent displays, and help carry a story filled with mystery, but also with a lot of humor.However, I have to emphasize how astonishing Ana de Armas and Daniel Craig are. Ana might be a bit unknown to most people. I've been supporting her ever since Blade Runner 2049, so I'm ecstatic that she finally got a major role in a big movie, especially within an ensemble of actors with legendary careers. Craig, who could have just delivered a slight variation of the character he's been playing for years, instead offers a unique take on the Detective role. Just like Evans, both have been playing iconic characters for years, so it's sort of an extra joke to everyone who watched Captain America and James Bond for the past decade or so.My only minor issue has nothing to do with the political undertone and the social messages Rian Johnson puts in this film. Honestly, I love that aspect of it. It's like Rian knew some people would complain about it, so he made sure to have a couple of characters (Jaeden Martell's Jacob and Katherine Langford's Meg) somewhat resembling the so-called snowflakes and all that. No, my issue is related to some excessive exposition regarding the first act's interrogatories. It's great that every character gets their own motivations, but it feels like each confrontation with the detectives went on for a bit too long. Some pieces of the mystery might be a bit hard to believe that they would occur, but these are all nitpicks in a remarkable movie.In the end, Rian Johnson is able to bounce back from the divisive The Last Jedi with one of the best whodunnits I've ever seen, Knives Out. Rian proves that not only he's a talented filmmaker but also a phenomenal screenwriter. With a renowned and impressive ensemble cast, Daniel Craig and Ana de Armas are standouts within all of the other outstanding performances, Chris Evans being right behind. With one of the best screenplays of the year, the mystery at its center keeps everyone extremely captivated until the very end, even if you guess ""who did it"" beforehand. Masterfully written dialogue, remarkable editing, and great use of classic cinematography techniques. It's an entertaining story with tremendous replay value and significant political/social layers that only elevate the already complex yet subtle narrative. Don't miss it!"
2454,"It's quickly get u involved to guess who the killer in the first part of the movie,reveal who is the killer in middle and a surprise twist at the end of the movie. Daniel Craig always the main forus everytime he shown up. It's won't get u bored and get u laughing with the actting and lines they put.this movie dare to challenge the traditional way of shooting a investigation movie and did it brilliant in a reverse way."
2455,"Wonderful, fun and enjoyable. That's all you need to know about this movies."
2456,"Based on the trailers I had expected a murder mystery in the old English style, the cast was promising so I looked forward to see this. I was surprised when I found out that most of the story is played for laughs and this appeared to be closer to a satire than a mystery.
I still enjoyed my time at the movie theater and would rate this 7-8 rounded up for Daniel Craig.I would have enjoyed this even better without the Infantile puking joke."
2457,"""Knives Out"" (2019), I was a bit skeptical about seeing this movie when I first saw the trailer, because it didn't look that special to me. Also, after seeing that Rian Johnson, director of the train wreck known as ""Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi"" (2017), wrote, produced and directed it, that didn't make it any more promising either. Then when I saw the cast, and looked at a spoiler-free synopsis for this movie on IMDB, I thought: ""okay, I'll go see it! Why not?"" I had some free time, so I went to go see it in the theater, and I'm glad I did. This movie was nothing short of excellent! Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect special effects, and perfect sets/locations. The only drawback though was the soundtrack. Now, it doesn't hurt the movie in any way, but it's your typical mystery theme and it's nothing to really write home about. During most of the movie, there is little to no music at all. They could have just kept the music out of the movie itself and just saved it for the opening and end credits. I would have honestly been satisfied either way! In fact, some of the songs used don't quite match the tone of the film. But as I said, it does not ruin the movie in any way and it does it's job, but with a lower standard. The story was very well done, it pulled me in and got me hooked within the first five minutes! It's just another ""Who Done it?"" film, but with a twist. But, to my surprise, it really worked! Most movies are just recycled plot lines, but the key is to add something new and fresh to a story told a thousand times before. There's even a big twist at the end that you won't see coming, it was quite a surprise! The casting is great, Christopher Plummer, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, Ana de Armas, that's just to name a few. It's a phenomenal cast, and they all perform their characters perfectly. Now, a lot of you know that Daniel Craig is my least favorite James Bond actor. Having said that, it doesn't mean he can't act well in other movies. I like him as an actor overall, but Bond is a bad fit for him. He can act, there's no question about it. His performance in this movie was great! But the only nitpick is his over-the-top accent. I didn't expect to hear him talk with an accent like that in this film. It kind of sounded like he was doing a Morgan Freeman voice impression! But, just like Dick Van Dyke's over the top English accent in ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), it doesn't distract from the performance. The special effects are top-notch, which is usually a given in modern cinema. Finally, the sets/locations were well done, and nicely laid out. Also, the sets/locations really set the tone for the story! This movie was very well done, and I was pleasantly surprised. Director Rian Johnson has really redeemed himself with this movie! It is worth seeing in the theater, and worth buying on DVD. I give it 4 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 8 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Knives Out"", go see it. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed at all!"
2458,"As someone who grew up watching all manner of Agatha Christie shows, and other mystery series of a similar type, I very much enjoyed my time at Knives Out.It sticks pretty close to the usual formula for shows of that type, and executes it well, with good performances from the whole main cast, and enough twists, turns and intrigue to keep one's attention throughout. It doesn't disappoint once the threads start to come together to fill the hole left in the middle of the story since the beginning.Daniel Craig's accent sounds like a caricature of a Kentuckian, and a comparison to that of Foghorn Leghorn wouldn't hit far from home, but I found it to be fun and pleasant, rather than irritating, as some attempts at regional accents can end up being.Most of the main circle of characters are modern American tropes (the young female college student, the teenage neo-nazi who spends his time on 4Chan or some similar ""social platform"", the middle aged woman who owns a business that sells cleansing skincare products and promotes a lifestyle of clean, natural living, the middle aged man who regurgitates right-wing talking points), and can be quite one-dimensional, but the core characters are unique enough that you don't feel that the whole cast are simply playing characters extracted via cookie cutter.Overall, I would recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good Columbo mystery, or has spent some time enjoying the incredibly high murder rates in Midsomer."
2459,"If you're looking for a movie to pick apart, stop reading and don't see Knives Out. But, if you're looking for an entertaining, clever film that will have you thinking and on your toes, then go see this movie.First of all, the cast is great! So many faves and all fit their respective roles very well.The movie starts out quickly and gets right to the point. After that you will be strung along on a ride that makes you wonder who the culprit is, and when you may have thought you figured it out, it proves you wrong.You are taken on a fast ride of twists and turns with a ton of chuckles tossed in the mix. In the end, it is all explained and neatly wrapped up for you.I enjoy films that are entertaining, make me think and try to guess whodunnit, and then gives an explanation that makes sense. If you want to be entertained for 2 hours then please set this film. I think it's highly underrated and was definitely under advertised.9 stars for me with a star taken away due to a poor choice of accent given to one of the characters/actors. For me , it was annoying and took away a little bit from the film."
2460,This was a great movie! It kept you guessing until the end. My one criticism was the medical knowledge used. They need a better advisor.
2461,"Knives out is the first film ever in my life which I was the only person in theatre. I knew there won't be crowd to watch this because it's a content driven film and not any comic book or franchise film. Why I wanted to see knives out was for Chris Evans. I am his fan since he played captain America. He made that character iconic. Usually Chris Evans non MCU films(whether lead or supporting roles) don't do well critically or commercially. But when knives out got critical acclaim, I got ready to book my ticket. I had to book my ticket in advance so that they don't cancel the show. I came for 5:30 show but film they were not playing after 5 minutes. I had to call the operator and make him play and he played it.
Now coming to the film, knives out is a murder mystery where Daniel Craig has come to investigate the death of a murder mystery novelist. I am used to watch mystery thrillers so I am familiar with its format. Knives out follows the exact format but suspense was revealed in the middle itself. It has a ensemble cast and everyone have performed well. Daniel Craig was enjoying a lot playing Benoit blanc. Ana de armas got a meaty role and has played well the sincere caretaker. Veterans Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Shannon kept their names. Now coming to the man for whom I had to sit in an empty theatre. When Evans appeared I was so happy. He made the film more enjoyable. It was good that he didn't get lost among all the stalwarts.
But, I had issue with the ending which could have been better. Many of the things done went in vain.
But I recommend knives out for murder mystery fans. Rian Johnson compensated for the hatred he received for last jedi with knives out."
