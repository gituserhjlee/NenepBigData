0,"Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET. The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series. The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films. It's truly something special! 9/10"
1,"Season 1 and 2 were fantastic. Kept me engaged, ""afraid"" and excited. Season 3 is pretty much a fiasco. The monster is grose, too much comedy which is not necessarily well placed, the constant bickering, and evil russians? Really? There must have been a better plot than that. The hospital scene reminds me of a bad zombie movie. It's a bit slow and boring. I'm halfway through the season, I must see how it ends, but I am slightly disappointed. I still enjoy the actors performance though. Winona is great, also most of the kids are pretty cool."
2,"I don't know what happened but this is a different show, it's almost a comedy now. Everything about it feels off, the pacing, the directing, the dialogue and writing, even the characters are almost caricatured versions of themselves. Only fitting that My Bologna by Weird Al played in the second episode.First two seasons were great, S3 is a parody of those two."
3,"It can hook you immediately, everything seems fitting , the setting , the acting , the direction. Just as it should be. Bringing out the perfect blend of 1980s nostalgia. It gives mixture of taste of big 80's movies.You immediately get hooked with the story , which is amazing because it takes time for me to get invested in a story. I have been a fan of David Harbour Since the Newsroom , and he is just amazing. You're scared , Intrigued , you're completely invested. With perfect setting.I am really looking forward to where this goes from here on in."
4,"Season 1 is a declaration of love to the 80ties ans films like critters, gremlins, goonies and some others. They picked up the in hindsight trashy charm of those in a perfect way.
Season 2 was still good, but i guess tv-series routine kicked in and with season 3 it became somewhat generic. It takes half the season episodes to pick up speed, the subplots are too equally big and too disjointed from each other, yet fail to generate the necessary tension, because when you have more then one storyline you have to let the viewer know more about the antagonist side or you get lost.
Often out of proportion aimless bantering are not helpful either to develop the story, they are just annoying. Some scenes are superfluous.
Basically you are watching half the season without really knowing what you are watching exactly. Failing to articulate the plot they fail the suspension.
Hopefully they will do a better job on the final season."
5,"With its amazing 80s atmosphere and creepy X-files meets E.T feel this show is set to impress. Within its first 8 minutes of run time I could tell I had found something special here in Stranger Things. Its intriguing story gives information at a great pace and I never felt myself getting confused of bored and there were enough twists or turns to keep me interested. This also had some rather great horror sequences and their use of lights flickering while yes a common trope fit so well in to the story I was on the edge of my seat every time the crackle of electricity shot through my speakers and the lights flickered. The characters of the show are the true stars here, I loved every single one of them. They were all great with amazingly interesting flaws and the way they mix and clash with one another was fun to see unfold. They certainly help to carry this show although I would say that the government antagonists of the show felt a little flat and under developed and not nearly as memorable. Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound. My goodness I loved their music choices. I would say that the CGI does look a little obvious and from time to time I did notice some issues where the scenes didn't look quite up to scratch. I do think however I've been spoiled for visual quality since Game of Thrones so I would take that criticism with a grain of salt because it certainly didn't detract from the overall experience. The setting and style of everything in the locations where also great to see and felt real and interesting. The way everything was shot also captures every moment expertly and really helps to draw out those story moments with greater emotion. Stranger Things is one of those special shows that I stumbled across and after the opening I knew I was hooked. Its exciting dark tale is expertly woven through its 8 episode run time and I know I will be back to re-watch this one. The ending is fairly well rapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons but the story is quite satisfyingly rapped up by the end. Memorable, exciting, dark and haunting Netflix knocks Stranger Things out of the park, 10/10."
6,"The main thing that doesn't make stranger things as a masterpiece or sth like this,is that it can't keep its plot refreshed as it goes on.I mean,in each season,first we have a nice time,then sth bad happens,then teenage guys go and fix it.it has becoming so frequentative.but in the other hand,the most of the characters are so lovely.I loved El and Will in season 1 and two, Robin and Hopper in Season 3.Altogether,this series is going to be one of your favorites if you like Sci-fic and a bit scary movies.Hope this review help you."
7,"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché."
8,"Horrible Russians = commies = bad propaganda.
All these silly catch and run Benny Hill show style, kids that infiltrated super secret, super secure underground fortress. This season is non stop cringe fest, with silly talks/songs, awkward situations, lack of communication and just LOGIC.
It was really hard to finish this season, uninspiring and ultimately disappointing."
9,"Season 3, that's all that needs to be said. Gone is the charm and charisma that the show had in the first 2 seasons (especially season 1). Russians have somehow built an underground lab 100 stories deep below a mall in rural America and installed Marvin the Martian's P-36 explosive space modulator. Why do they want to reopen the portal to the upside down? We never find out because too much time is spent on forced humor and and awkward scenarios that we don't care about. The connections between characters is not there and it just felt sad. The song Dustin's girlfriend forces him to sing at the most crucial part kills the pacing and is just more forced unwelcome humor. There is also a Terminator disguised as a Russian for good measure. What happened? This falling after the horrible season 8 of GOT. What a bad year so far."
10,"I'll leave my score at 8/10 in homage to seasons 1 and 2.
Season 3 left me with very mixed emotions, most of them negative. I wont go into the issues as many others here have listed them well.
For me, just as you saw a glimmer of hope that the storyline was emerging from the wreck, it crashed again with spurious awkward out of place dialogue, irritating characters and messages. Stereotypical bad guys and most of the questions raised left unanswered.
By the end I just felt sad and annoyed."
11,"That's about it. The first season was brilliant, the second one was OK, the third one was barely watchable. If they continue like this in the forth season, it'll be massive disappointment."
12,"NO ACTUAL SPOILERS, BUT SOME OUTLINES.The first season was great: Brave producers that were able to create a show that hat such a great 80's vibe, unike story, relatable characters, a pinch of horror and children as main characters that didn't make it a childish show. It was so good that you even could get over the way to obvious product placements in the story.
The second season was still good. Even if it could have stopped (story wise) after the first season there still was room to continue as they did. Still a great season but not as good as the first. New introduced characters were still relatable. But after that, the story was over.
But then it happend what always happens when people and networks are to greedy: they turned it into a horrible cash grab. The main plot was ridiculously distant from the prior plot. They invented a new story where the ""Russians"" were the bad guys. Wow, I guess that story has never been told before. It was filled with nonsensical and unfunny stereotypes. But the real issue is everything that goes on the side of the plot. The product placement was so laughable that it felt sometimes like a real commercial. The boy&girl relationships were written in a way that they took the most silly stereotypes and made them even more silly. And the worst thing is the character development, especially of the main character ""eleven"". She behaved in a way that was not even remotely realistic given the first two seasons and the backstory. I've cringed so many times over her ""attitude"". And even the rest of the characters became even less relatable.Conclusion: First two seasons watchable and the first was really good. But the only good thing about the third season (and probably for the rest of the show) was that I watched it instead of studying for an exam because I was even more bored for studying than watching this piece of garbage. Peace;)"
13,Netflix is all about new subscriptions. If you're not continually bringing in new viewers it's bye bye and as a result some good shows that have a steady viewer base get cancelled ( Santa Clarita Diet). Stranger Things keeps bringing them in hence besides the fact it is dying a slow death it continues. The first season was lots of fun- they got the early 80s on but by Season 3 it's clearly just rehashing the same old. Even the cast seems bored especially the chick who plays Nancy.
14,"The first season was fantastic! The second season was a copy/paste without the magic. Unfortunately, the third season was just an empty mess. A complete waste of time."
15,"It's good but if you've watched a lot of similar tv shows it's not as good as them. I wouldn't say it is as good as people make it out to be, however if this is your genre then I would definitely recommend you to check it out!"
16,"I've been trying to put my reaction to this series into cohesive sentences - even cohesive thoughts - and I just can't seem to do it. ""Stranger Things"" blended the best parts of some of the great 80's sci-fi films from ""E.T."" to ""Poltergeist"" to ""The Goonies"" to my all time favorite, ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind."" It was simply brilliant, and brings you back to a time when you were still able to feel a sense of wonder.Though there are plenty of thrilling moments, this film does not rely on heavy CGI or jump-scares. It focuses on relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a touch of romance. It takes you on a journey from a parent's worst nightmare to the resilience of those who rely on friends and cling to hope.Also - you'll never look at Christmas lights the same way again."
17,"The first season was 10/10. I can't quite articulate what's been lost in seasons 2 and 3. The mystery I think? Part of the horror was watching people struggle against an unknown enemy - a single unknown enemy, another of season 2's downfalls. Also the fact that the children, teens, and adults were initially separate, fighting the same problem but with slightly different stakes and information, was really fun to watch in the first season. None of this is to say later seasons were bad (though 3 was better than 2), but they don't live up to the brilliance of the first season"
18,"I honestly found the trailer worrying a few months from release, and sadly I was right. Season 1 and 2 are brilliant. I love this show. Season 3 unfortunately drop the ball astronomically. I found most of it predictable, cringeworthy, boring, unreal Russians being the ridiculous bad guys from like a cartoon sitcom. 80% of the dialog is pointless filler, there is no progression from season 2. We learn nothing new about the Upside down world, about Eleven.Over all it doesn't capture the essence of the original Season 1 and 2. Hugh Disappointment."
19,"The cast and directors have done an admirable job of making an average monster in the woods story much more enjoyable than one would expect. I also think it somehow appeals to a wide range of ages. I enjoy the 80's nostalgia. The performance of Millie Bobby Brown, particularly in Season 1, is a large part of why this show works. I hope that it doesn't take itself too seriously as it goes forward and that it can hold onto the surprising fun and easy watching it provides. Well worth a watch.While I think it is good not great, I am always surprised how hard it is to stop watching a season once you start. Maybe it is better in the moment than in the memory."
20,"This review got deleted for no apparant reason. It was ranked as the most helpful 1 star review and got to be the 13th most helpful overall, so I am reposting it with minor adjustments after it got deleted.This is a list of everything bad about season three that I can remember.* Hopper turned into a a major as*hole for no real reason.* Max was an overacting, useless and annoying character* Eleven lost her powers for some reason* Coke, Eggo, and burger king product placement* An entirely out of place argument about which type of Coke is best that lasted several minutes. Didn't make any sense.* ""Never ending story"" song when people were dying sung by Dusty-Bun and Suzy-poop.* The Sassy, mini Michelle Obama who is apparently a math wiz and political expert (Erica)* Forced mentioning of being a lesbian that didn't serve the plot. Apparently, everything needs a coming out story now to fix the past.* Russian military outfits* Jonathan moving away from Nancy* Eleven moving away from Mike* Bickering about who is a bigger nerd between Dustin and Erica... while trying to escape murderous Russian men* Talking about my little pony when it had nothing to do with the plot... at all.* Max ""enlightening"" Eleven by trying to get her away from the boys. Surprised they didn't turn into lesbian lovers and that Eleven didn't come out as bi.* No explanation of why Eleven lost her powers* No explanation of why Russians are under a mall wanting to reopen the gate* Alexei had no purpose except to show off his weird smile* The absence of Will for most of the show* The fact that Will only ever said ""can we play D&D now?"" Or ""He's Here"".* Forced and unnecessary references to anything that ever took place in the 80's*""Does you species like M amd M's?"" -MikeAny finally.....*The fact that suzie-poop and dusty-bun sung an entirely random song at what would have been the most suspenseful and critical moment of the entire season. That completely ruined the ending of the show!"
21,"Season 1 is spectacular
Season 2 is ok
But season 3 is awful, is trash. Please don't waste your time watching this series."
22,"Season 1 was pretty good. Season 2 regular OK. But they ruined everything on 3rd season turning it into a childish sunday afternoon movie, full of cliches, sketchy BD-like villans and failed attempts to make comedy wich ended up destroying all the great misterious atmosphere of the 1st season. It's a shame."
23,"The reasons in no particular order:1. The red scare: the russians' plot felt contrapted, it's inconceivable that the USSR was able to build a whole underground military base in the middle of indiana where the US government had a secret base as well. Also they portrayed the Russians as one dimensional villains. Also highly trained soldiers were constantly beaten by a fat cop (doesn't add up).
I may have given them a break on this if they were involved in s1 or s2 and this was a continuation, but out of the blue in season 3 they just show up.2. Product placement (cocacola, marlboro, eggo's, etc) was excessive. There is a whole scene just about how awesome is cocacola in ep7!3. All the ""suspense"" scenes weren't exciting at all. We knew that nothing bad will happen to any of the main characters no matter who they are facing. They all had plot armors4. The main villain is a one dimensional lumpy monster with no particular plan or purpose, just roaring and stuff5. All the talk between kids about capitalism, socialism and communism was out of character and cringeworthy. Please don't go into politics.6. There was no character development through out the season, no real plot or story.7. Puberty: self explanatory8. Too much music in scenes that didn't need any (that's my personal preference).All in all
S1: 9/10
S2: 7/10
S3: 1/10"
24,They should finish with season 2. Loved first two hated the third.
25,"S1= secret agencies, mysterious experiments, physic powers,the dark subject matter of the abuse of these subjects to exploit such powers, and the thrilling escape from these nefarious machinations.S2= we get to explore the other world, foreboding air of danger throughout, development and growth of the gang. Similar tone as the 1st season and closes it well.S1+S2 fits and works together.S3=budget feels halved, core group split up for nearly the whole season, big CGI monster that looks at home in Resident Evil 2 or The Evil Within 2 video game, contrived setups , poor consistency , cheap guard costumes and lazy jokes.Even worse thing is that they somehow made the characters flat one-note archetypes, with romances shoehorned in. It's quite sad for what S3 has turned out to be.Guess it could be summed up as if it was made cause fans wants a new season (naturally since S1 and S2 was good) , and the producers and creators decide to chase the money that comes with that. Rather then working at it until they have something interesting to show, they just went with a hackjob of various 80s cliches.And of course in analyzing why the drop in quality is so dramatic, we also need need to look at the pressure the suits must be pressing on the showmakers.
Imagine an even greater fall in Netflix stocks if S3 was not made in time ....."
26,"Season 1 and 2 are magical. I binged them in a few days. I rarely get sucked into a show like this, but this was great. It had something for the kid in me, it had action, it had humor, the characters were likable, it felt like it had everything. It put you in the 80's and felt a little like Freaks and Geeks to me with a sci-fi twist to it which was fairly creepy and well made. The interactions between the characters were great and the chemistry was there, so thumbs up for Season 1 and 2.That being said, I would stop watching at the end of season 2. Season 3 is a total piece of garbage. I am struggling to watch it, I'm at episode 5 now and it's not getting better. None of the characters feel like themselves. They are parodies at best of the characters they were in the first two seasons. But for the most part they feel like totally different characters, like I'm watching a different show. Everyone is angry and shouting, the plot makes almost 0 sense, the product placement is annoying to say the least... It's just sad, I feel betrayed almost. I initially thought they changed writers and directors because it felt so different...So watch season 1 and 2 and leave season 3 alone... I watch it on my ipad while doing other things just because I feel I need to finish watching it now like a chore... but oh my God... season 3 is horrible..."
27,First two seasons were great and then with 3 season they ruined everything.
28,"Stranger Things absolutely lives up to all the hype! This worldwide phenomenon has been one of the most talked about shows of the last few years and for good reason...it's terrific! Not all but most of the negative reviews are coming from either bots from competing streaming services, that rate everything that Netflix does bad, or from people who go out of their way to rate all the shows people like negatively. Some people just don't like it, which is fine, but there are people who are just miserable and like to troll. 99% of their reviews are negative. Who goes out of there way to comment on something they don't like? Personally, I only review shows I like. Obviously, season 1 was the best but the others are not far off. All are absolutely worth watching and I can't wait for the new season!"
29,"Season 1 = 9/10, season 2 = 7/10, season 3 = 2/10. Season 3 what a joke. No plot, no story, nothing new, cheesy, cliche, just plain annoying dialogues, illogical, cringey. CRINGEY! What a woeful, horrid season. Writers and producers should be ashamed."
30,Boy did this go downhill. Gone are the solid acting of the first two seasons and character development. The whole thing feels goofy and uninspired. Some scenes are utterly pointless and I had to skip them. One scene in the last episode (that stupid song) is absolutely cringeworthy and ruins everything and how it wasn't cut out is beyond me.
31,"I expected better than the mess that season three was. It could have been so much better.This should have been about the kids versus the world. Not the kids versus each other. I hate how they used Hopper to create unnatural conflict between the kids. Perfect way to ruin the character who used to be my favorite.Dividing the groups in genders was very cringy. Max and eleven should never be with each other. Max is a horrible character and never had any chemistry with Eleven.""There's more to life than stupid boys""
-Max the mad maxi padThat was max's way of ""enlightening"" Eleven.Constant and Mindless banter and bickering involving Dustin with Erica, and Steve with Robin.My little pony conversations? Seriously? And the Constant bickering between Erica and Dustin about who is more of a nerd.This horrible dialogue took me out of the moment and ruined all suspense.Dustin singing never ending story was horrible. It was so unbearably out of place and long. The song isn't the problem, the problem is that the song felt like it would never end, and was so poorly placed. Singing while people are dying is what this cheesy disaster of a show has turned into.I can't believe anybody actually liked this season after seeing that!This show was supposed to be a deep science fiction drama series. Not a useless cringe-inducing and shallow sitcom.Having Robin come out as a lesbian was so unnecessary. Why not put effort into making the dialogue serve the plot instead of showing that you're culturally sensitive? Stop trying to use an 80's themed show to fix the past or something. Just stop. Robin never fit in with the other characters anyway.Why are the Russians there and trying to open the gate?Why was this season a useless redo of what we already saw except with more useless bickering and cheesy Russian costumes?Maybe we are expected to watch season 4 to find out, but I have lost all interest."
32,"I want to state that I LOVE this show. It's my fav9rite one on Netflix for sure but I wanted to be honest in my review. Honest and thorough.*SPOILER ALERT*1). I am a HUGE fan of this series but had an issue with season 3. I have just 1 question. Where were the parents to ANY of these kids at? I mean SERIOUSLY! I was raised in the 80's. I had to be in the house before the street lights came on. As far as I know, there were I think 2 kids who actually had their friends cover for them and 1 of them wasn't even part of the original gang.2). There were more cuss words (the ""S"" word in particular) in one episode than there were in the entire first 2 seasons. Okay, it is a little bit of an exaggeration but once you watch it, you sill see. Season 3 episode 5 is a particularly ""colorful"" one, to say the least.3). When there is 7:37 left in S3E5 ""chapter 5, The Flayed"", what is up with Nancy's half hearted (I wanted to say something other than hearted but decided to keep it child friendly) run??? You have a psychopath chasing you with super strength and you basically speed walk down the hallway for help? They are in a hospital. Why not let out a blood curdling scream?4). Hospitals have back up generators. Why were the lights flickering like for so dang long?5). I know it's a small town but NOBODY saw the giant bloody alien thing being flung out a 3rd story emergency room entrance window at the hospital? Nobody? Not a Dr, nurse, patient, patient's families, security guard, receptionist, deli worker, heck, not even a gift shop employee?6). In S3E6, Robin spits in the Russian General's face. After she did, immediately afterwards, he wiped it off with a handkerchief that just happened to be in his hand at the time. Why not spend a couple of seconds showing him grabbing it out of his pocket?"
33,"This an utterly meaningless, unintelligent, unimaginative, boring and childish waste of time."
34,"ATTENTION TO ALL OF YOU WHO LIVED YOU'RE YOUTH IN YEARS 80, liked movies like Goonies, Portergeist, The Evil Dead, The Thing, Alien(s), Star Wars, ET, Clouse Encounters of the Third Degree, Indiana Jones, It - Stephen King, Lord of the Rings (ok, this is newer, but the books are older and the references are all there) and so many other fantastic and unbeatable classics of that magic decade. I have to say: Watch THIS, STRANGER THINGS! Oh really. Watch it. But watch accordingly: at night, turn off your mobile, whats-app, Facebook, Instagram, blah blah blah, watch as you should watch every movie, with immersion, transport yourself into the adventure, and I assure you, you will remember how it used to be, when going to the movies itself was already an adventure. You will be transported to the 80's. Cool characters, family dramas, pure and sincere friendships among nerd, intelligent, and excluded children, teenage's dramas, music and soundtrack of the 80s, in every detail, from the suspense in songs of each scene, the opening song and title of the series, the soundtrack, the references/homage to the 80's is very strong, very clear. I loved it. For me, it is among the 2 best series I've seen in the last 10 years, with only Game of Thrones at the same level. I cannot think of any other that has given me so much pleasure to watch, which has given me the desire to watch again, and again, and again. No, not even Breaking Bad, Marvel's Daredevil, The Walking Dead, The Expanse (unknown by many, but i liked), NCIS, etc. I'm looking here at the list of series that I follow (around 50), and none is equal to the entertainment provided by this. Congratulations to the Duffer brothers. The series is amazing. Worth every minute."
35,Show should have ended after season 1. Season 1 was a 9 for me season 2 probably a 7 but season 3 definitely a 2
36,"It really hurts me to write this review but I really don't know what happened with season 3. To me, it looks like Netflix interfered too much and tried to turn a thrilling drama into a teen comedy.Season 3 is a completely different show. The directing, the WRITING, the pacing, even the music composing is completely different. I had to take a 20 minute break after watching the first episode because I knew something wasn't right. All the suspense and thrill of Season 1/2 is completely gone. With season 3, there is no moments that make me interested in the slightest. 90% of the season is Mileven relation issues, Steve working as a sailor selling ice cream, Hopper trying to be funny, and other weird scenes that seem so out of place. The problem is that these characters weren't funny in the first two seasons, they were unique and charming in their own way. Now Netflix has turned this once exciting show into a comedy that is completely studio written without regards to the characters traits or anything. Hell, the jokes aren't even funny.From a technical aspects, everything has went down hill as well. The camera work, editing, sound, and acting all don't know what's going on either. It's like they don't know if their doing a thriller drama or a terribly forced cringe comedy.It really hurt me to watch this season. I didn't enjoy a minute of it. I'd like to talk to the Duffer bros because I know someone got to them because you can tell within 5 mins, this is not their style. That, or the Duffer bros are just trolling us as a way to boycott Netflix or somin. I have no idea but something is up, this is way worse than went GoT and HoC went downhill on their last season! N"
37,"There were countless moments when they could have acted much quicker e.g. escape, attack, run away, hide, etc.
I mean the last episode - Jim Hopper said count to three with the keys? Seriously? You could have done it already. All they did was stood there and watched and looked panicked e.g. Nancy and Jonathan in the hospital; the kids not running away after Billy broke the sauna room glass window; Nancy in front of the car when Billy tried to crash them outside Starcourt in the last episode, etc.
Max's character made her look silly and valueless.
The continuous arguments between Jim and Joyce were unhelpful.
I used to look up to Jim but he was off putting in this season - hot tempered, impatient and always yelling.
Please don't ruin a good tv series like this."
38,"Bad comedy made for kids, painful writing and of course, the must-have ""girl power"" that infestate most shows and movies nowadays.But they did it, like in many other productions, in the most stupid and sexist way possible: they depict most men in the show as dumb or clueless while all mysteries, actions and problems can only be solved by the women.Pro-tip: if you think that the only way to show how strong women are is by depicting men as bad, then you don't have a good argument to begin with."
39,"Bad plot, disjointed storylines, unbelievable Russian involvement & the only monster in the move is the ""wokeness monster"".The boy can't get the girl, girl can't get the boy, the toughies have to be female, they men need saving, we have to inject a gay character (who is not believable as a lesbian) and of course our hero losses her powers... so original, so woke!"
40,"I thought season one of the show, while not without flaws, was a fun and mostly well-executed coming-of-age story and adventure romp that paid homage to family movies of the 1980s like ""E.T.""However, after a season two I felt seriously regressed, and a third season which seems to be regressing even further, I can't help but feel the charm of the show is wearing incredibly thin.Part of the reason the show wears thin, in my opinion, is the lack of any interesting usage of the time period it's set in."
41,"Season 1 was great, season 2 ok, but season 3 is trash. This show is overrated."
42,"If you liked season 1 and 2, you will hate season 3. The script was just terrible. Some bad Russians have infiltrated the US for some reason, and Noone is aware except for the kids. My God what rubbish this is. I saw half the season before I had enough. Worst thing I've watched for many years."
43,"After a great first season, a second .. not so good one already, this was the disappointment of the year. Teenage love stories, childish dialogues, poor acting and all possible boring and simply impossible situations. Even or maybe especially Russians cannot be that blind, stupid and fitted with these make-believe clichés.
The sherif has mentally fallen back to ""Kindergarten"" level. Too much teenager ""bla blas"".
Stopped watching after painful 1,5 episodes."
44,"Season 1 was amazing. The story was robust and characters had reason to be in the show. It conveyed the 80s feeling with a good blend of 80s music.Season 2 was good. The main story line was solid still although there were some questionable parts to it. Some characters were cheap and not well developed.Season 3 was garbage. It seemed like the writers were tasked to see what people liked about the show and just fill the story line with them. It had excessive use of brands. The 80s music were just injected every where for no reason: every time a person entered the scene, 80s music was blasting loudly. Dialogs were extremely predictable and cheesy. Each character's personality was unnecessarily exaggerated: Hopper is always angry and unreasonable, Erica was constantly sassy but the smartest person ever, the mayor is the worst person in the world, the whole newspaper crew were excessively mean. And finally, the whole plot with the Russians was cheap and not at all well thought out. It was hard to finish the season really."
45,"Season 1 was fantastic, season 2 kept the ball rolling. Season 3 was a poor concept riddled with weak characters who's behavior was inconsistent from previous seasons, drawn out far too long and wrapped up so poorly that the characters on the show could have written a better script. Haven't been so let down by a show's ending since how I met your mother."
46,"It's like they tried so hard to make us dislike the show, ( and succeeded)"
47,What can I say? Season 3 was like a parody of the other two seasons. Complete woke nonsense. Russians with unexplained motivations. Jokes at all the wrong times. Horrible characterization. Woke sjw nonsense everywhere. Don't waste your time with this season I'm sorry I did.
48,"The sloppy writing, directing and acting are over the top in this season. All of the actors have become self-conscious of themselves and too fond of themselves. The writing is just childish. This should have been a season of come backs and excitement, but it is not. Someone, please tell your make up people that women in dire, life-threatening situations don't show up in full make up and lipstick. Please tell the special effects people that blood doesn't turn orange as it dries.
The whole season is more of a comic book for teenagers than entertaining for adults. If that is the production goal, they have succeeded. I am not going to watch in the future should they continue the series."
49,"Just watched the first chapter last night. Everything about it is great, the actors, the writing, the fact that it takes place in the FREAKING 80s (YES!) and all the music. The theme music is completely on point...very John Carpenter-ish with heavy synthesizer sounds that are very menacing. Watch this show, tell your friends to watch. It feels very Stephen King/Steven Spielberg..with some X-Files mixed in. I have never seen the kid actors before but they were all so good. Their on screen chemistry reminded me of the group of friends from The Explorers, Stand By Me or The Goonies but it's definitely not lighthearted or a comedy at all. It's always a good sign that a show is going to be good when you are completely sucked in within the first couple minutes. 10 out of 10 so far.﻿"
50,"Losing its Spielberg meets King tone, Stranger Things' 80s seem more a collection of movie references than a milieu. However the show is now structured less like a movie than episodes waiting for a cliffhanger. The Russians don't even feel like throwback villains since they've pretty much returned as a standard Hollywood trope. But where they're shoved in requires almost as much suspension of disbelief as the upside down. Forcing us to believe two impossible things is maybe a bit much. The season's okay, some of the chemistry is still there, but it's running low on whatever the magic ingredient was."
51,"I guess plenty of people have said a lot of things about all the movie and TV references this series has and how it recreates the eighties in all their faults and splendor. I will not add to that.With the release of the second season I'd simply like to advise that both seasons are very different animals. Think of it as the difference between the original Alien movie and the Aliens sequel: Whereas the first season was more about an unknown and unseen horror and the mystery behind the backstory, the second has more in-your-face action and horror laced with character development arcs which feel nice but sometimes sidetrack the series a bit.Consequently, a fan of the show should probably watch the second season as a separate work of fiction rather than a true continuation of the first season in tone and spirit. The writers move the story forward and we get a very good piece of entertainment but the new season has to be judged on its own merits.EDIT: Season 3 turned out to be a huge change in tone for the series. Maybe it's really hard keeping up the mystery if much of the ""world"" of Stranger Things already yielded many of its secrets but the overall ""feel"" of the series went into a different direction. Maybe the writers simply ran out of 80' templates to rip off. Season 1 was very much inspired by supernatural horror as in ""Poltergeist"". Season 2 took many cues from ""Creature Features"" like ""Gremlins"" or ""Aliens"". Season 3 now uses elements of 80' zombie flicks and low budget gore horror with a little bit of spy comedy mixed in (and fight scenes which feel straight out of ""Die Hard""). All those genres didn't really mix well in the 80' and this strange cocktail sure doesn't work today. That doesn't mean that Season 3 is bad. It simply relies on characters who were established in previous seasons which used very different 80' story elements and tropes. It's almost like seeing Darth Vader in an Indiana Jones movie. Both work on their own but not together.Basically, Season 3 is an all too transparent attempt to plough a fresh nostalgia field but it doesn't work in the context of previous seasons."
52,"First season was an absolute relief from the all-formulaic, know-what-comes-next, predictable shows around, some of them successful and welcome to an extent, but we're always looking forward to the ""next big show"".Stranger things had it. Or at least, it looked like it did.
Season one definitely kept us all wanting more and it was a long wait for the continuation, then it started going downhill but adding the same formulas the show appeared to stray away from (which was the best thing of the show)Season two, if there was nothing more from the writers of the show, should have found a satisfying finale, since Season three has not offered just more of the same, but taken it to new grounds of clichés, taking very little advantage from a great cast enssemble which they should have cared more for, and the writers should have at least looked to deliver what the cast itself deserved.Unfortunately, the show simply took a nosedive. Less likeable actors were brought into the mix since season two, and we kept waiting for the plot point where they would prove the cast was perfect and that they had something up their sleeves. None of this happened. Yet, the audience was forgiving. Hey, there might be some great growth and development for season three, right?
Wrong again. Those two characters being Max and Billy, well, they had no reason to be in the show, it's like they needed some wildcards so they could throw any save-the-cat kind of writing moments into the show, not because they were planned, but because they had done exactly the opposite: not planned anything at all.The more I write the more I feel ""nostalgic"" about the first season.
That being the main reason the show did well in the first season: Playing with nostalgia. But once you make it the strong part of a show, with the actors coming second, and the screenwriting taking a third, even a fourth or even fifth place in priorities, well, it even makes you be grateful that such a sweet era like the eighties, has passed.Season 3 is a collage of ""why don't we add some russians into the mix.... why don't we make it more gory.... why don't we give them an alien instead invasion of the body snatchers...? ... why don't we ..."" until we as viewers are like : Why don't we just forget about the show, and let it go down in the glory it once had.Such a shame. They were onto something good. Now instead, they've made any films or shows that use that nostalgia from the 80s be something, well, redundantly, old.
I look forward to any content that has the actors that were a part of the show since season one (from the second season, meh, I wouldn't care if they're simply forgotten, they've given their all, and their all just turned out to be straight-up mediocre)"
53,"No idea why they ruined the series so bad. Please save your time and don't watch season 3. It's tv series at it's worst, trust me!Season 1 worth a 10/10 but IMO rating comes according to your worst season. And season 3 worth like 0/10, even 1/10 is high"
54,"Season 1 - 7/10
Season 2 - 6/10
Season 3 - 2/10Season 3 is a totally disaster, is it a comedy? They trying so hard to make us laugh, but failed badlyNuff said"
55,"Blah blah blah season 1 and 2. When it comes to Season 3, it pretty much undid everything the first 2 set up. Having known the upside world was attempting to breach the barriers into the real world, and continuing with why, they instead decided to give us saturated dialogue, inane scenes of stupidity, Cold War blathering, with non stop cursing and fighting between characters that made you like them even less. The relationships between El and Mike, Hopper and Joyce, and the other 2 couples were too cringe worthy to watch. The Frankenstein looking character who dates the sister was better as the weird guy, not the self sabotaging misogynist who treats his girlfriend bad, then realizes she's always right. The screeching and fighting was just so overdone, it took away from the storylines that made the first 2 seasons much more exceptional. I hoped all of them would break up just so I wouldn't have to endure their asinine dialogue anymore. Pathetic.On top of that, much of the two sided foes of the Russians and the demagogue were watered down in a quick fix it way, that left you scratching your head. This season needed at least 2 more episodes to explore the dynamics, instead their was no explanation of how or why the Russians figured out the upside down world to begin with, how they knew about the town, and where to find the entry way. The only connection is a mayor we've never been introduced to before who may or may not have known. Billy on the other hand became a side character after he seemingly would be a focal point. Seriously, anyone could've become the main zombie.I also believe most people found it was unnecessary to include an LGBTQ character. Is this necessary now? The mandatory gay or trans person? It made little sense, and added zero to the story line.Also, The Russians in their military uniform on American soil? Yeah ok. Unless the Russians are the dumbest country in the world, they wouldn't have their men in uniform no matter where they were for fear of being exposed and causing WW3."
56,"Writers have really screwed it up big time this one! If you're out of ideas, give it up already!"
57,"Stranger Things season 1 was absolutely brilliant spot on the money. Then came Season 2 and it was less. Now we have season 3 and it is with all regret absolutely terrible. Where should one start? Let's bullet point:*Russian propaganda done horribly wrong.
*New characters added did not help the plot but made it worse and cheesier.
*The main kids have inevitably grown up which reduces the magic of 1st season and 2nd.
*The adults/parents are cartoonish and retarded.
*Political correctness added (LGBT approved) which is totally irrelevant considering the 80s theme.
*The upside down world reduced to ashes (mimicking).
*El's character is just a fighting machine and did not contribute to the plot or made sense later. (Oh wait apparently these zombies are doing it all for her or to eat her!?)
*How these random people went through a Russian secret base is beyond me. And then the code was cracked by a little girl.
*Winona Ryder was screaming with hysteria throughout the show making her look like a child.
*Finn's character is only rolling his head and eyes and being helpless.
*Last scene of last episode was a wtf one in a negative way since it made no sense whatsoever.
Lastly to conclude unfortunately and quite frankly this season was atrocious on many levels. There were no similarities to season 1 and many of the things happening in S1 and S2 were not followed up as if the producers dropped them without explanation. We have been waiting for 2 years and now we get this. Of course the cinematography was amazing including the soundtrack but the rest fell flat."
58,"Loved season 1, season 2 was ok, but season 3 is cringeworthy and bad. I only watched all 8 episodes because of my wife. The overuse of El's power kind of ruined it. The addition of new characters was fine but at times, too many and too much, the original 4 get shut out. Not going waste time with 4th season."
59,"Bad story line, bad and mean situations comedy, i felt like this was a kids movie, the mind flayer is too scary yet its too weak, the Russians? are you serious? L? teens amour? this is so far the worst season, and for me the orst series of the year .. big disappointment"
60,"I loved season 1 and 3. Season 3 not so much. It went from such a great show of crazy darkness. Season 2 such great depth into the upside down. Now season 3 Russian spies and bad guys, really it's turned into Russian bad guys so disappointing no upside down just traveling through a high-tech Russian bunker. Terrible terrible. Crap story for the third season"
61,"Season 1 was just awesome, season 2 was nice, too, but season 3?! Extreme lack of logic, kids infiltrating super secret military bases of the Russians (who are now suddenly the evil dudes?), too many unnecessary jokes, songs nobody wanted and overall too much of everything.
Overall score: season 1 = 10/10, season 2 = 9/10, season 3 = 6/10 so a 7/10"
62,"The first season is by far superior. If only they finished it there.Season two whilst not as good was a good watch.I think season 3 can be summarised by one scene in the last episode. Dustin gets in contact with Suzy, instead of getting the number required for the safe, he makes her switch to a channel everyone can hear so he can show them he has a girlfriend. This despite the fact everyone is in mortal danger, with the majority of the cast being chased by a giant flesh monster and the rest stuck underground.What makes this even more absurd is, she demands Dustin sing a song with her before she gives him the number required. At this point all fear or suspension about the episode is gone.Pacing was bad in this season, a lot of unnecessary scenes and the show dragged its feet.Fun watch but inevitably it will be compared with the previous seasons. And for those who loved Season 1 for the mystery, horror and suspense will be left feeling hollow with this new entry."
63,What happened? Wow. It's painful. S3 brought my rating from 9 to 1. So bad.
64,"Started of well but the season 3 has turned in to comedy circus. The writing is pathetic with cheesy one liner. all the characters trying too hard to have their say and all of a sudden everybody wants to be heard, by the way how did Russians manage to make a huge bunker in America???"
65,"The show should have stopped with season 1. Season 3 was a major disappointment-I mean the lame plot with the Russians, cringey dialogue, and boring, repetitive action sequences. Not to mention the uncomfortable kissing sequences between Eleven and Mike. They should just stop beating a dead horse and end the show, but Netflix likes money too much."
66,"The dark story is still there and it's enjoyable to watch but unfortunately I had to skip many parts in season 3.
The majority of the scenes have this awful teen comedy theme with that typical annoying goofy background music that goes with the ""jokes"". They are all the same and doesn't lead the story anywhere. When you see it coming, just skip 5 minutes of the episode and you won't miss anything important.I'm very disappointed in the direction this show has taken. 2/3 of this season is something you expect to see on a bad Nickelodeon show."
67,"Sometimes it's difficult to find the words to describe what particular elements of a creative endeavor felt disappointing. Other times it's incredibly easy.The third season of Stranger Things was a depressing mess which exposes the flimsy foundation the series is built upon which includes 80's era nostalgia, pop-culture references and every horror/science fiction trope in existence. The other ingredient is extremely likeable characters who end up being exceptionally watchable in spite of the copy+paste plot that has been provided for them in the third season.Things in Hawkins, Indiana haven't gotten any stranger over three seasons. We're still dealing with the same villainous entity, the same heroes and marginally different villains. Generic Government cronies have been replaced by Soviet stereotypes. The series is suffering from a crippling case of sequel-itis running its cast through the paces as it moves towards an all-too-inevitable conclusion.There's part of me that's been feeling this way since the second season, when I quickly realized the show reshuffled the creative deck and played the same cards. The third season has calcified my belief that the show only has lateral moves left to play and updated references to include.Stranger Things is what happens when you turn Easter eggs into a television series.The second major issue I had with the third season is very simple: Dramatic irony. For viewers, the plot for entire third season is pretty much revealed in the first episode and a half. The villain, the new host and the entire Russian involvement is all pretty much laid out. The next five episodes are spent catching the characters up with what the audience is already painfully aware of. Joyce (Winona Ryder) is still going on and on about magnets losing their properties when everyone watching knows exactly what is being powered up underneath the Starcourt Mall.The first season was replete with mystery and tension while building to a satisfying conclusion. The third season is an absolute mess with every major reveal happening so early on that you become impatient waiting for your characters to figure out in episode five what you were well aware of in episode two.There's also some weird tonal choices. Max (Sadie Sink) learns that her brother is possessed by our evil friend from the Upside Down. In the next scene, she's at a hospital goofing around with her friends like it's no big deal. Simply because the show has to change gears into the pubescent romance plot. How can she worry about her brother when she has to deal with those throbbing hormonal urges? GIGGLE GIGGLE GIGGLE.The first season of Stranger Things is an excellent bit of homage and escapism.

Instead, it was a brutal disappointment."
68,"Its just for kids. Trust me, the romances are all very naive. The plot is tiring. Series 3 is the worst.
I fail to understand as to how in times of distress, people find time for personal discussions and arguments. You see this too often in all the series. It just doesn't end. If its for entertainment and fun, it makes it more boring and cliche.
Thats why I say, this is for the kids.
I hope they stop or mature."
69,"Perhaps it just my age that made the 3rd season so difficult to watch, however much I enjoyed the first 2 seasons. This season was so juvenile in it's dialogue, so sophomoric in execution and style that I spent most of my time fast forwarding through the youthful hi jinks just trying to get to the heart of the story. I'm all for character development but the majority of the writing was spent on just that, with little left for plot development. Frankly I found it boring. No disrespect to those who enjoyed it, but the first 2 seasons were clearly superior, in every way, to this dull witted presentation, more concerned with trying to make you care about the characters, but only succeeding in making them tedious, and boring."
70,"Seasons one and two of this series were pretty cool and it should have ended there. Then season three came out I am thinking about how stupid it makes everybody look. Evil Russians? Really??? I get the whole 80's nostalgia thing they were trying to create, but they went full throttle and floored the accelerator and hit that 88 miles per hour and ended up with a ridiculous plot-line. The whole idea that ""Evil Russians"" somehow built a top-secret base without the Americans finding out is a bit insulting and unbelievable (even if I have to suspend belief I still can't ignore logic). This isn't a safe house for a few Russian spies to create a base of operations. This is a base with (at least) a couple of hundred Soviet soldiers and which is, apparently, so long that you need a cart to travel underground was all built without any detection of any American agency at the height of the Cold War. I would have assumed that the Agency responsible for opening the portal in the first place would have stuck around for at least a couple of years in Hawkins to make sure that nothing had been left behind... I don't know, something like a mobile goo (which when you really-really look at it resembles poo). The resources to build something like that would be a logistical nightmare even if they had built the mall. Try to remember that they tried to place nuclear missiles in Cuba and they got caught. Are they really going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an operation that may or may not work? Somehow, a bunch of kids just stumble into an elevator unnoticed by all the armed guards and cameras. Not only are the Soviets dumb enough to let anyone enter into their base they also use their Soviet military uniforms and weapons (like that is not going to attract attention at all...). There is no reason for the Russians to be in Hawkins and it is never explained why they are trying to open a portal to another dimension or they know of its existence (unless they watched the series via Netflix). The Russians simply exist because the writers thought it really-really cool to kill evil reds (the Nazis just weren't available)! All of the Russians are portrayed as sadists who take exceptional delight in drugging and beating up children (Evil Russian Colonel: Hahahaha... it's so good to be evil comrade now let's go drown some puppies for I am feeling very evil today!). There is even a Russian terminator whose only function is to be cruel and choke scientists in mid-air for failing ""to bring evil into the world"". We get it! The Russians are evil... The writers of this series are forever averse to explain why anything on the show works the way it does or how the Evil Russians discovered the portal in the first place. The adults in this series are also so dumb that only person who seems to notice a giant multi-legged spider walking around is a little girl (Look at the fireworks you little ingrate! Were celebrating America, freedom and Coca Cola here! Stop paying attention to obvious monsters!). When Jim Hopper calls the authorities and says that the said Evil Russians are on American soil nothing is done. I can even picture Ronald Reagan in the oval office telling his generals to stand down because a bunch of middle-schoolers are going to save America (who needs the Marines when you have Dustin singing Never Ending Story ugh!). The Mind Flayer, a disgusting creature made from something that crawled out of a sewer, created this magical goo to destroy Eleven for closing the interdimensional portal. Of all the plots the writers could've used was for instance using one of those weird kids who had powers to open a portal. That would have been cool to watch. They were kind of forgotten back in season two. But using ""Evil Russians"" is a bit of a cliché."
71,"We loved season one, season two seemed like a rehash, season three was funnier but so PC that we lost the characters that roped us in at the beginning. First, why would Russian spies in the middle of America at a mall wear uniforms? Second, how did they build a 50 story hideout under the mall without anyone noticing? Third, why are half the kids on the show coming out of the closet this season? Something in the PC Hollywood water? Fourth, how much did Coke pay for product placement? It was ridiculous. I liked the 80s references and wanna go buy an old Camaro now because they are still cool in 2019! The soundtrack was BANGING! Do the writers realize that each time L used her powers and her nose bled, that was a ""brain bleed?"" She has no more blood to bleed! They need to let the series go now -- it was a good ride but we have reached the end. Oh, almost forgot about the little Michelle O, a 12 year old scientist with a sailor's mouth and sense of entitlement -- not subtle. Men dumb, need women to save them, over and over and over. Overall, season three, enjoyed the jokes and music but hated the PC. Great show overall"
72,He third season is on of the worst season series ever!!!! By far !!!
73,"I liked season 1 and maybe season 2
However season 3 was bad
1. All the ""suspense"" scenes were meaningless to me as you know that nothing will happen to any of the main characters. No matter the odds or how strong the opponent is you know that a fat police officer is able to obliterate an army of highly trained soldiers
2. The red scare in 2019 is unbelievable. ""The Russians are coming"". The ruskies built a whole military base in the middle of America! Is that believable!
3. Too much product placement ""cocacola"" in almost every scene possible really sucksI was apathetic while watching the whole season"
74,"Season 1&2 were relatively ok, but season 3 was just infused with way too much emotion. Also i fell like Hopper lost all the character development we saw all through the previous seasons and the show is also too focused on relationships ie mike/eleven and max/lucas. I actually didn't finish the season"
75,"Let me start by saying I didn't have any high expectations for this new season. I knew this season would need to start an entire storyline from scratch and that there would be repetitive elements. So once I watched it, I was saddened to the extreme that my once beloved TV show took such a predictable turn. It's been 2 days since it aired and I still cannot believe what I just watched. This season completely lacked its sense of originality which we all loved from its prior 2 seasons. The plot was a literal copy of the second season ( monster -> closing the gate) with just more ""funny"" dialogue which was completely unnecessary. It really reduced the show to an over dramatic comedy show. The once great characters were all so unbearable to watch. The only interesting characters were Will, Robin and Dustin this season. So much of the plot was so annoyingly stupid that I couldn't believe the Duffer brothers came up with something like that. They left so many important questions (the Russians) carelessly unanswered just for the sake of progressing the story; which had no real depth. Even as a massive fan I had hoped they would've ended the show at s2 instead of prolonging it. Because clearly they are no longer capable to produce a season that could ever match up to their first. I don't have the slightest clue how they can pull off a S4, part of me doesn't even want to know because of this season's sheer disappointment.
Honestly I could go on and on about how many aspects of this season I disliked. But I just can't be asked rn, just needed to vent. I hope this show learns from DARK, a masterpiece of a show which beams with originality and consistent writing. For all these reviewers who say this show is worth 10/10. Go watch DARK and you'll change your mind."
76,"No matter the structure and details are not rigorous enough, but the good thing is that the atmosphere is well constructed and the visual impression is good. The performances of several children are also quite vivid and nostalgic."
77,"Season one was great, season two was reasonable, season three is just terrible. The level of writing is about the level of 3rd graders at best. It's just obnoxious that they try to pass this off as quality entertainment."
78,"I thought this series was fun until... the third season. What happened? Why did it get stupid as a Disney production? After what happened to Game Of Thrones, I'm not surprised anymore. But it's still disappointing. I won't be following it anymore."
79,"Season 1 was original, authentic, thrilling. Season 2 was dragging a bit, scrambling for original ideas turning into a brainless horror. Season 3 turned into a complete trash - a mix of Nightmare on Elm Street, Red Heat and a teen comedy. I have downgraded my original 8 rating down to 6, as Series 3 is very mediocre and full of cliches. What a disappointment! :-("
80,"This was the weakest of the three seasons. Too much comedy, plus the imbecile and unrealistic Russian thread. Instead of a smart storyline and new ideas they tried to fill the plot with comedy and an alian-type monster."
81,"Wow, where do i start. First season starts off quite good. A brilliant premise and very fresh and captivating at the start. First season was engaging. However, season 2 onwards it went downhill. Season 2 as a whole was average at best and now after season 3 i barely recognize the show i fell in love with. Overall subpar and makes no sense whatsoever. I can no longer take it seriously.
Season 1-8/10
Season 2 6/10
Season 3 4/10"
82,"Good Series. Everybody acted very well in the movie. The series was so interesting and thrilling from the beginning. The series bored and lagged at the middle of the series. After some episodes, the series was so interesting and thrilling. Good Series."
83,"Seasons 1& 2 were great. But Season 3 is overkill. Why is it necessary to flog something to death? This a common problem with so many series - basically success creates greed, and the need for recognition knows no bounds. Season 3, episodes 1 & 2 are ridiculous, a complete waste of time. Things pick up a bit in episode 3 but by episode 8 is so predictable as to become boring. Should have quit at the end of Season 2."
84,Series 3 is a nightmare. Same old. Nothing new. The first two series were brilliant. Time to retire.
85,"This is my first review because I really needed to say something for this once great series. Don't get me wrong, I loved seasons 1 and 2 because of the great acting, cinematography, plot, writing, character development and action and even the monster was good. Season 3 was almost the opposite.I think what happened is that they ran out of ideas. Everything feels forced and cliché. The 80's vibe isn't there anymore. The acting is still great but the characters are put into environments where they don't fit or they have already tried it on and there's no reason for them to try it on again. For example, with Robin, they really didn't need to go mainstream lgbt hollywood but they did. Too bad because I was really liking her character. Max and El's thing was unnecessary.The plot runs thin and dialogue is mostly cringe (the Coke product placement is...ugh). There are too many side plots and the characters don't feel like the characters much. I knew immediately from the first episode that something was off, it was too teen romance and relationships, Hopper's character did a complete 360. I get that they grew up/ moved on/ changed but something still feels weird.The last part was a bit emotional but I still don't get the generic Russians plot, it wasn't anything original. That last bit at the end was also pretty generic.Overall, it feels like I'm watching a low budget
comedy/thriller monster movie with decent acting and I am so disappointed. I really hope the Duffer brothers step it up and pull out their magic in season 4 because I know that magic from season 1 is somewhere in there."
86,What went wrong with this show? Everything. Season 2 and season 3 were garbage.
87,"Season 1 was great, the setting , the themes, it all worked very well.
Season 2 was on a repeat of season 1 and already left a bit of a sour taste
Season 3 starts off quit well but turns into a mess, no interesting dialogue, the plot is lackluster, comedy and romance that detracts.
If the trend continues season 4 will be a massive disappointment in the making.Here's hoping they can turn it around!"
88,"Waited for season 3 after being totally impressed by the first 2 seasons which was spot on in delivering the chills, thrills, suspense and drama in perfect combination with a crisp script. The biggest let down of season 3 is you start losing all the respect for every character you loved in past, as they erupt into an uncontrollable roller coaster ride of emotions that are all out of place. Seriously not one character seems to act according to the gravity of situations, comedy n temper tantrums, silly unwanted conversations etc. during grave moments are totally off-putting. Stranger things started off with gravitas of the likes of E.T, War of the Worlds etc., and inside first few episodes it disintegrates into a less than normal comedy like Goosebumps."
89,"Any science fiction/fantasy series worth watching knows that seasons must build the story until their final season. Stranger Things 3 chose to adopt the generic ""evil Russian"" plot to reopen and rehash the material we came to understand in Season 2. Their motives are never explained. It's lazy writing. In addition, a completely unnecessary death of a main character feels like a Hail Mary attempt to force emotions from viewers."
90,"It is obvious that they planned this TV series to be just 1 season. However, when it gained popularity among teenagers, they extended it to 3 seasons.1) PRODUCT PLACEMENT: Most irritating thing is that they exaggerated the commercial. Coca Cola and Burger King commercial were boring.2) NONSENSE PLOT: In 3rd season, they included Russians in it. However there are many illogical situations. First one is that, having came to USA for a crucial & high risky mission, Russians don't speak even a word English while Americans speak Russian, that is ridiculous. Secondly, they builded a facility like a underground city but there aren't cameras or security at doors. Thirdly, plot is not covering why Russians are there? We know they came to open gate, but why? They didn't reveal it.3) STORY GAP: ""Eleven"" has a sister in second season, and they have an episode together. From s2e2 to s3e8 they didn't meet again and we don't know exactly what are mates doing in New York city? In addition, they didn't tell us why Eleven lost her talent?4) UNFOCUSED SCENARIO: CIA was sleeping while three kids were decoding Russian secret message and moreover, Russians used a common radio frequency channel to communicate. Does it make sense? Are we watching cartoon film or adult TV series?5) UNNECESSARY HUMOR: In 3rd season, children are making jokes in even serious moments and it spoiled the atmosphere of horror and excitement.FINALLY, the only thing Netflix can do well is making children kiss one another and product placement!I am out!"
91,"Not in the direction I was hoping for.. So I've never written a review before and never had to change a rating, that's how disappointed I am. Loved s1 and s2 was epic, the story went deeper and darker so that's what I was expecting in s3. Instead I just watched a sh1tstorm of cliche after cliche, a mush of cold war style evil russians, a russian terminator, an area 51 type conspiracy theorist, baywatch, back to the future and a neverending cringe story, that was not original or entertaining whatsoever. Dialogue and characters deserve one big facepalm.
Why not rather explain what the upsidedown is, what is it that the demogorgan/mind flayer wants exactly? or at least explain why the russians wanted to reopen the gate? No. We learn absolutely nothing new. Nothing makes any sense. No incentive to look forward to a new season.
So good bye stranger things, it was nice to know you but it's time to move on.."
92,"Why not focus on making a good series that concludes on a high and leaves the viewer wanting more instead of dragging it on until every last dollar can be squeezed out while the viewers gradually leave in boredom and disgust?Season 1 was brilliant. 9/10. Season 2 was watchable. 6/10. Season 3 was as engaging as watching a dead horse being flogged. I watched it hoping it would come to life, but it never did. 3/10.Not only that, but there were some truly cringeworthy moments the Dusty and Suzie duet being right there at the top. If they'd panned a shot to the Mindflayer we would've probably seen it cringeing as well.Needless to say I won't be watching Season 4."
93,"What can I say Netflix has done it again!I was hooked from the first episode! The acting in this is brilliant, especially from the younger members of the cast.The period it is set in they have managed to get it spot on down to the littlest details.I especially like the musical score in it, sets the mood superbly! This series has the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, and scares to keep you wanting more!! Hope this show runs for many more episodes, it's a classic in my eyes!"
94,"Really, after the excellent 1st & 2nd seasons, this one is pain. I had to watch the 2 last episodes with fast forwarding just to end this pain faster. Behavior of the characters is ridiculous, the writes put a lot of unsuitable comedy into the show with stupid 'comedy' music. The suspense has been lost (only a couple of moments, El's journeys were good). I dont plan to watch the 4th season."
95,"This is one of the most magical things I have ever had the fortune of viewing. I won't go into details about the narrative, which is build on classic sci-fi and horror concepts and it works. But what really makes this show excel is the little things. The casting is amazing - every single character, regardless of how small the part is, feels like a complete character, and the main cast delivers some powerful stuff all throughout the series. The production is spot on in it's portrayal of a small town in the 80's, and I have to assume that it is in part based on the creators own experiences and childhood, because everything feels real.The only thing that bothered me throughout the entire show was the incompetence of the government entities. I know and understand that this is a popular portrayal of the government in these types of stories and especially in the US is this a common sentiment. But it simply didn't seem believable that they would make some of the choices they did. Doesn't take a genius to see that they are doing a crummy job. But this is all in all a negligible detail, as it keeps the story moving."
96,"Season 1,2= great. Season 3 = a complete joke
So childish and illogical"
97,"I don't know happened here but holy crp they messed this up on the writing and plot side. The actors perfomances are still very good (the new character is too) but the 'evil Russian' trope is ludicrous , the plot development makes no sense, the music and sound design is sub par."
98,"So I watched of of Series 3 over a weekend (I also watched all of Series 1 and some of 2 earlier.) I can only say that I should have done something else because S3 was so awfully disappointing and boring. Here are my reasons.1. Lack of a story.
So mysterious monster/s decide without any purpose to invade the small town of Hawkins through a subterranean gate. At the same time, Russians try to open the gate, despite knowing that monsters lie on the other side.2. Sarcastic bickering.
In almost all character groupings, they bicker sarcastically, sometimes for minutes on end. I fast-forwarded many of these without any loss to the story. Since none of these bickering episodes add to the story, they are wasted time. It was almost as though the scriptwriters thought, ""Oh! We have a conversation here! Let's have the characters not say anything important that might add to the story. Let's make them bicker instead!"" In fact, one of the characters even says at one point (perhaps an ad lib?) ""Please stop bickering!""3. Random illogical story-slowing scenes.
There are several of these, but this is the most stupidly nonsensically random and unnecessary one. So two characters apparently have to sing a song to each other before one will give a vital bit of info that will save the world. Sorry?4. Nostalgia vs Story.
Yes, the 80s nostalgia was good, but Story always comes first. Drive the story forward with straight, clear direction. Let the Nostalgia support the story, not the other way around.5. Pacing.
I don't mind a slow start if I know it is going to be rewarded somehow. Yet S3 took two episodes before there was any hint of a story. TWO EPISODES! In screen time, that is almost two hours! Sorry, but a story should give its viewers/readers/listeners some idea of its direction and purpose MUCH earlier than that.6. Ripoffs from other movies.
I have not seen many of the movies that other reviewers have mentioned, but it appears that there were several tropes and elements from 80s movies that ST drew from. That is all very well, but Story MUST at all times come first. ST had enough going for it in S1 to be original. It is very sad that it simply became a bland blancmange of other movies in S3 than a standout of its own.7. Predictable
There was only one surprise in the whole series, and it came right at the end. Pretty well everything else was signposted. As a result, I skipped over considerable sections.8. Stupidities
!Spoilers ahead!* So why did Hopper just look at Joyce instead of running back inside the safe room where she was? It was only a few steps, and he had the time.
* So why didn't anyone check on Planck's Constant before they went on the rescue mission?
* So what was the purpose of My Little Pony? You sorta expect that characters will be fully focussed on saving the world, not bickering about why a kids backpack has this cartoon figure on it.9. Cliches abound.
S1 was pretty good in terms of cliches, The scriptwriters restrained themselves and produced something pretty tightly scripted and directed. S3, on the other hand, wallowed in a glut of cliches, too many to list here.Summary.
This had the potential to really shine. However, it is best suited to those who want a mindless, poorly written, unoriginal time-waster. For those looking for a decent, original, thought-provoking, tense, surprising series, look elsewhere. This is most certainly NOT what you are looking for."
99,"The plot was superficial and at the same time confusing, despite the very good main cast. Good chemistry between characters wasted on feminist or lgbt propaganda. Cliches. Lots of cliches. Unnecessary quotations. Too many ads. The soundtrack and the beautiful footage are still the strengths."
100,"Season 1 was worth watching but after that it went downhill. Season 3 takes the price though, it's such a laughable piece of garbage."
101,"I loved seasons 1 and 2. I rated the series 10, but this last season lost any sort of adult appeal for me. It was very childish and repetitive. They basically remade season 2 into season 3. The advertising was ridiculous! There isn't any depth to the story. It was all just surface level. I had to force myself to finish each episode and I kept fast-forwarding through the uncomfortable dialogue. The Duffer Brothers need to dig a little deeper or hire people who can do it for them, so they do not ruin this series. Hoping for a better season next time."
102,"I was a huge fan and couldn't wait for Season 3. I had to force myself to watch the rest, after Episode one. I felt like I was watching a terribly written and performed horror movie, which is not what the first two seasons were. There were constant, and I mean constant, fighting and insults between even the adult characters. These people are supposed to care about each other?? Naturally, there had to be a nod to LGBT, but in middle America in the 80s? Wouldn't have happened in reality. In conclusion, this season is not an embarrassment to the Duffer Brothers, but is instead a humiliation for them.
Frankly, I don't plan on watching Season 4, if there is one. They would've had a classic on their hands had they stopped after Season 2. If you want to see what Stranger Things could have been - watch ""Dark."""
103,"Season one was incredible, but season 2 and 3 went bad. This show should have ended after season 1."
104,I believe stranger things is a show made to please the average audience
105,"First two seasons were great, but, this third season was duff. The final episode was particularly duff, I'm hoping they leave it at that. It was so silly, Russians managing to build a giant complex under an Indianan mall and people it with hundreds of soldiers and scientists as well as all the equipment. Oh, come on!
As someone who was a young person in 1985 I felt no sense of nostalgia, in fact it felt like I was watching on of those duff American kids versus evil Russians movies like Iron Eagle. Not good.
As for Dustin singing 'Never ending Story' I ended up cringing and fast forwarding through it, a silly waste of time that didn't work.
And don't get me on to the corrupt mayor, such a caricature."
106,"With Hopper gone (he had time to leg it, why didn't he?), any new sequel is condemned. With storywriting like like this, who would want to replace him?"
107,"Season 3 of Stranger Things was completely off and it was a disappointment. The storyline, too long dialogs, too much love discussions, and the very essence of the story was lost. Eleven did almost nothing at the end to rescue the world. For me this is the end of the show. As always, a decent show is ruined by completely crap story of two children agains 200 Russian soldiers, an underground base made in a year that it should take 20 years and of course nobody was hurt."
108,"Instead of reviewing the basically perfect S01 and great S02, I will only comment on S03 in this review. The Duffer Brothers obviously ran out of ideas to borrow from Spielberg, and now they copy Cameron and other 80s action directors-auteurs, with mixed to terrible results. ST still looks amazing: style, color, SFX & VFX, sound and editing are as good as they've ever been, but the writing has been turned into lazy copy/paste, with a million bad puns and exaggerated character traits as well as fan service and 80s Easter egg hunt.Almost every character in the series is now a caricature of their former self. Everything has been dialed up to 11 and that's not a good thing, because not every aspect of Season 3 needs to be aggressively inflated for it to make sense and be entertaining. Sometimes less is more. Oh, and yes, the evil guys are now Russians, whom are Scooby Doo villains.The kids have turned into Ethan Hunt-type secret agents, all adults are morons, and there's an annoying emphasis on female empowerment and lack of privacy. I expect S04 to turn into an 8-episode telenovella with a few scares and thousands of 80s Easter eggs and references, instead of a well-wriiten, compelling storyline. It was great while it lasted. Goodbyen Stranger Things, hello El & Max, the most annoying female character after Janice from 'Friends'."
109,"After two excellent seasons, everything is off in this one. The script, the forced humor the dumb tension. And then the kids that used to be so good, now awkward teens."
110,"It should have ended in Season 1. What upsets me the most is that I will never get my time back I spent watching S3. Proves one more thing: if you run out of ideas, bring in the Russians portrayed as halfwits, vodka soaked and always inferior. What a cliché. Acting is 70's television theatrical. Was it supposed to be a comedy then, or sifi or drama? A jack of all trades is a master of none. 2 first episodes could have been squeezed in 5 mins. Medley of overplayed 80s songs that directors were trying to stick into any available space between product placements. Now imagine there were no seasons 1 and 2. Season 3 would not have gone past the pilot. No awards material here."
111,"Season 1 was a masterpiece. There shouldn't have been a 2nd one in the first place but, okay, season 2 was alright. Season 3, now... ughh there was no reason for this one to exist whatsoever. No character development, no answers to any of our questions from the previous seasons, nothing. Hopper became unreasonable out of nowhere, all of his development as a character was taken away for... reasons, I guess?
Season 3 also felt more like a Scooby Doo episode, but with ridiculous propaganda everywhere and unnecessary dialogue as well.
Making Hopper take a huge step back as a character, then killing him and then throwing the hint that yeah, um, maaaybe he didn't die after all was cheap at best. I mean, really!? This tired trope? I'd swear the writers were different ones this time, but... nope. If you can't make a decent season, then don't make one at all. I'd rather the series had ended at a point when it was still watchable.
Also: Max shouldn't have so much screen time, and shouldn't be sold as a ""wise"" advisor to El. We didn't really need the teen drama, it wasn't even believable or decently written. Huge disappointment, season 3 dragged the whole series in the mud.
Oh and a girl couldn't possibly not like Steve, she'd have to be gay for that to happen. Clumsily trying to be inclusive, I get it, but... meh. Didn't get that right either.
Finally, to be fair, Billy's death scene (apart from being emotionally abusive to the audience, cheap trick) was spectacular. I couldn't look away even though I wanted to.
In general... a tired ""meh"". Stop making the show worse with every season."
112,"Season 1: was really well written and done but then came the free fall.
Season 2: still watchable, almost Disney warning!
Season 3: So childish, gaping people, bad acting, stupid very stupid.
If you 7-12 years old then OK. I feel insulted and disappointed.
WTF: The Russians build a huge base in the middle of the USA? Please kill me.
Better to watch ScoobyDoo."
113,"There were two dominating forces in the eighties that had a lasting effect on my cinematic taste for ever after and also resulted in my undying love for fantasy, sci-fi and horror stories: Steven Spielberg and Stephen King. I guess it isn't an overstatement to say ""The Two Steves"" probably influenced and shaped the imagination - the dreams AND the nightmares - of an entire generation.The main factor why I loved their movies and books was that kids roughly my own age figured so prominently in many of them. King wrote 'Firestarter', 'It' and 'Stand By Me', and Spielberg either directed or produced (via his company Amblin) 'E.T.', 'The Goonies' and 'Gremlins'. Those were stories where the young protagonists encountered aliens and monsters or where they themselves had supernatural powers - or where they just went on an adventure (to find a body or a long lost treasure) with grown-ups largely out of the picture. Now if you've seen 'Stranger Things', that should sound pretty familiar, right?Of course it does: because 'Stranger Things' deliberately pays homage to all those stories - and it does it very, very well. And it's not a rip-off, it's a love letter. The show emulates the themes and a certain style from those eighties treasures, and while it is a (for me) very welcome callback to some of the favorite stories from my youth, it's also very much its own thing. I won't give away the plot here (I guess you get a pretty good picture what it's about from what I wrote above), but I would like to mention that it's beautifully shot, the effects and generally the production values are top-notch, and the period-inspired music is fantastic. The biggest shout-out, however, has to go to the ensemble of actors, especially the kids who play the protagonists: their charming performances are the key to why the show works as well as it does.To sum it all up: If you're an eighties kid like me, this show is a must. For everyone else, it might depend a bit more on whether you're a genre fan or not, but if you do like supernatural stories, 'Stranger Things' is a treat. I'd rate it eight stars out of ten, but with an extra star for nostalgia, that's a 9.Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
114,"Honestly there was so much wrong with this season so let me keep it short by just numbering them off.1. The teenage drama the first few episodes was terrible and shouldn't have been written in. Mike and Eleven have become the most overrated and annoying characters in the show.
2. The fact that Wills only purpose is to forever be a pot device for the monsters, which honestly sucks considering we all know how good an actor Noah Schnapp actually is. The writers gave him nothing to do this season.3.They completely ruined Hoppers character.4. Erica. That's all I need to say.5. The stupid annoying song that ruined everything.6. Eleven losing her powers with absolutely no explanation why. It seemed like a cheap cop out.7.They are relying way to hard on 80s nostalgia to carry this show and they really need to come up with new ideas.8.This season was cgi galore. The first season was so much more natural.9.The fact that this show is basically becoming what everyone else here is saying, a teens show. Seriously they might as well kill of all the adults and focus on the teens if this is what their doing.No but seriously, look on Twitter and instagram and the only ones truly praising this season are the teens own ""teen fan base"" and ""stans"". There's probably more but I'm not about to sit through this season again to find them. I also find it hilarious that most critics are giving it good reviews but all I see when I scroll through here is 1s 2s 3s and 5s and 6s. Just goes to show that critics don't know anything and are only giving it good reviews cause it's popular."
115,"Season one was low budget, but managed to entrance us with the intriguing tale tale of a young girl with super powers who escapes from a government experiment into the lives of three boys in Hawkins, Indiana. We are introduced to an alternate dimension- the Upside Down, where evil monsters lurk and seek to enter ours. The story is full of 80's nostalgia and Easter eggs, with plenty of laughs, scares, and kids overacting and talking like grown ups.Season 2 continued the story with the endlessly entertaining Sean Astin, and a road trip for our main character. We finally learn about Eleven's family, and those around her at the government prison.Season 3 is a stinky, wet gym sock. The Duffer brothers gave up all attempts of writing a coherent story, and simply went through the paces of action/horror movie tropes with no regard for plot holes. Eleven's powers conveniently weakens during encounter to put her group in mortal danger. The contrived scenes of a foreign invasion under a suburban mall in Indiana is not believable. There are saving graces like Terminator references by the main villain and nonstop period appropriate jokes, but no enough to save it.It's too bad season 3 is only 4 stars. It dragged down a nearly perfect series into just above average territory. I will let my kids watch season 4 first before risking 6 hours of my life."
116,"Season one s been a 10 star for me (i was hooked from 1st episode), followed by a season two which appeared to me a little bit more like a badly done filler. Season three... well.. i fought through episode 1-4, always hoping to see some character development, some mystery but i only got fed up by the retro feelings the show tries to awaken.
It has become shallow entertainment where i was looking for thrill and yes... mystery."
117,"I dont want to say anything long.They started to construct the whole series based on Commies vs Democracy cliché. Dissapointment.Kids started to look like a super-powered mercenaries. They can sneak into USSR base without any obstacle and the little kids started to act like a Jimmy Neutron.And I closed the show after the to sing while everyone was being killed.Unfortunately, the series lost all seriousness and solid ground."
118,"I just finished season 3. It was not good. I can't see myself hanging around to watch season 4 since the show declines every season.Season 1 was really good.
Season 2 was average with its highs and lows
Season 3 was not any good.Honest review."
119,Basically every characters in Season 3 are very annoying. No content at all just see them keep shouting and no taking action. Season 3 sucks!
120,"I started watching stranger things and got hooked. I enjoyed season 1 and season 2 sooo soooo much.
I enjoyed every episode and every episode left me in a really good mood.AND THEN... THE WHOLE SERIES WERE RUINED FOR ME.
Season 3 is such non sense. Such a stupid and plot.
I have a hard time understanding that there is 1 single person on planet earth that could enjoy season 3... As a few other reviews said, season 3 feels more like a parody of season 1 and season 2....ANOTHER GREAT SHOW RUINED!!!"
121,"I mean, no serious plot holes, and some solid acting on behalf of most of the cast, , but nothing stellar, either. A pretty solid, average score of 5.Surprisingly, I find Ryder's acting to be the most irritating out of anyone's in the cast. She strikes me as shrill, with very little nuance. I think the series would be much better without her."
122,"Season one pulled me in, season two was pretty good, but season three was lame.Like what's up with:
1. Russians infiltrating the mall. So much time spent on that.
2. Joyce and Hopper fighting about nothing. It was funny at first but then I was confused.
3. Killing off Alexei. Why?
4. Robin. Why can't she stop verbally abusing Steve?
5. Dustin being split from his friends the whole time. They're funnier when they're together.
6. The globby monster. Super gross and seemingly pointless. Why didn't it use demogorgons?
7. That ""Neverending Story"" song during the climax. Eek.
8. No one noticing that all these people are missing from Hawkins who were part of the mind flayer's monster.I liked that they didn't make Eleven do everything and save the world again, but a lot of the plot was similar to the last season which made it less interesting. I was excited for the season but it fell short of my expectations."
123,"As the general consensus goes, season 1 and 2 were really good. If I were to have rated the series on those seasons alone, I'd give a solid 8.5 - 9. However, since the series did not stop at season 2, well that means that season 3 must be considered and boy is it terrible.Season 3 starts off really slow. Because of that, you don't realize how bad it is until about episode 5 and then it really hits you that, wow, this is bad.If I could sum it up, I'd say season 3 is sort of like a bad Disney movie with s word being thrown around by kids.The plot is ridiculous - where are they going with Russians and why? I won't go into details but just know you're expected to believe that 4 kids sneak into an underground facility a la Austin Powers were the guards basically fall for the ol' tap one shoulder and make them look while they sneak past the other way.Then of course there's the 50' monster just roaming the town and NOBODY besides the cast notices?It's just dumb. I know you have to suspend disbelief for a show like this but combining the surreal and cheesy lines not to mention the terrible chemistry between Hopper and Joyce this season it's just a train wreck.At the time of this review, season 4 isn't confirmed and I honestly couldn't care less if the show ended after 3. The first two seasons keep you wanting more. Also, keep in mind that if the past timing is any indication they take about a 3.5 year break in between seasons so I don't know, I guess we'll be seeing Stranger Things - The College Years in season 4. The kids already grew up quite appreciably between seasons 2 and 3."
124,Season one was great. Season 2 was ok. Season 3 shows they lost the mojo. Don't even care if I see season 4.
125,"On season 1:. A cult series that will show the path for many generation to comeSome series are meant to last and Stranger Things is one of them.The mixture of awesome script, directing and acting by the whole ensemble bring to life a world of friendship and loyalty which will stand the test of time. Most sincere congratulations to the Duffer Brothers and Shawn Levy for this amazing journey. Please keep up the good work for as many seasons you deem fit. My awe for the whole cast for their superb, awards-winning and believable play. The chemistry between the young actors is just unbelievable.And lastly, my true, emotional and special congratulation to Millie Bobby Brown, without whom the series just would not work.She is the soul of the series.
Millie, you just shine.
On season 3: What can I say. We waited 21 months for this season. We as the fans, hoped for a wonderful season full of mystery and stranger things, but we were let down.
In some aspects this season is enhanced. We have more special effects and more work on the monster business and devilish plans. But!, That was not what made stranger things great in the first place. What made it great was the underneath mystery, the thrill and most of all the awesome chemistry between the characters.Season 3 lost almost all that, the interaction are shallow, more cheesiness than I could count, an unbelievable storyline, many fill-up scenes and some musical stuff in an ultra important moment, seriously?!Our characters are not the characters that we love and feel pride about their strengths, powers and weaknesses anymore. Adding characters without enough depth, background and creating unbelievable and weak story lines almost always lead to catastrophe.The directors and producers seem to have been voodooed to provide us fans with this season 3 after season 1 (the strongest) and the acceptably good season 2.
It is as if their work and ideas have been hindered and meddled with leading to a let-down season. They need to accept their mistakes, they know better what they are, work hard on them and deliver us with a better, shinier and more powerful season 4 in another 1-1.5 year.Dear directors and producers, a humble suggestion to you, never weaken the soul of the series, Eleven.
Never take her diamond spark away. You know what I mean. Everybody to work please for an awesome and stronger than ever season 4.
Netflix, you too, you have your share of contribution."
126,"I was really looking forward to season 3, because 1 and 2 were so good. They dealt with serious issues like kidnapping and the loss of a child, and honestly showed the truth of people's behavior. The stuff of great storytelling. Soul, mind and heart. Season 3 had a stupid, superficial cartoon-like tone completely losing the gravitas and dignity that made the show so good. There was 10x more CGI and 1/10th the soul. It was kind of heartbreaking. Instead of learning from shows like Supernatural that maintain their integrity and did a 15 (!) year run or ST Voyager, they lost the truth of their story. They knew better than to dumb down this show!"
127,"Season 1 good, season 2 okay, season 3 horrible-typical Hollywood style cheesy comedy"
128,"Two seasons was good enough. Did their best to stretch out the ""story"" into 8 episodes and make a full season, but this could have been a 1.5 hour movie and be done with it. Just another Netflix series to take up my time, instead of entertainment."
129,"Season 1 is a masterpiece - a mix of Spielberg, King, the music from the 80s, funny kids in a small town in the middle of nowehere. Everything is good in season 1. Season 2 is OK, a little bit far-fetched, but sticks with the original concept. Season 3 however is horrible, just horrible - it is not even that the writers simply have no idea what to do with this concept, but it is freaking ugly - loud, colourful, annoying. Season 3 is like every good movie taken by the Hollywood and destroyed to the core- all what was subtle is changed into colourful screaming ugliness. I would rate it 10/10 for season 1, 8 for season 2 and 4-5 for season 3, sorry."
130,"I was hooked to this show after first episode, I loved first season and its best till date, season 2 had
good strory/plot but poorly executed, and now the 3rd one, one of the most overhyped season of 2019, can't tell how terrible season 3 is. Characters are Plot-armored, and Fighting scenes just doesn't make any sense. Very poor story, Russian can make those high-tech industry in the middle of US, but can't afford Surveillance Cameras. LOL and I want to write many Plot-holes in S3 but I won't because since season 1 this show is filled with full of plot holes, I've stopped watching this show at moment in Episode 6 where i sees Nancy and Jonathan unharmed after all that beating by those Zombies. LOL even anime shows makes more sense than this total Garbage."
131,The producers and director of this season should be ashamed of themselves.
132,"How to make Stanger ThingsRecipe:
Take 10 part X-men
Take 10 parts ET
Take 20 parts Aliens
Take 10 parts Godzilla
Take 10 parts Mirror
Take 5 parts
Take 5 part Highschool musicalMix it together until nobody suspects plagiarism and you have got yourself a show which is simple enough that children can enjoy. It is a children's show with boring plotlines mixed in with cheap thrills. It is highly predictable with no real consequences to the primary characters. Everybody comes out safe and sound and only the secondary characters die. Stuffed with huge plot holes and nonsensical teenage drama this show is poor horror and even worse comedy. At no part you feel invested trying to guess the mystery. Although it does have its moments where it's mildly interesting. If that's your thing then all power to you."
133,"Season 3 stinks. There are many reasons many reasons for this, but primarily the following: The coming of age story is unavoidable, but it often looks like ""Stand By Me"" meets ""Ghostbusters"" and the teen angst wears pretty thin. If you ever saw the ""Goosebumps"" series, this will seem like an R rated flashback. Those pesky kids are at it again.... they just need Scooby Doo and the Mystery Machine van. Apparently screaming your lines is an indicator of serious acting because there is a lot of that, and these are serious actors aren't they? I could barely tolerate the slime monster or un-killable super human hosts. Possibly they could barely tolerate it themselves and we're glad to dissolve into goo. A disappointment after a good first season and a less good second season. I wish I had more than two thumbs down to give it."
134,"It is not completely rubbish but with our great expectations it is sad to see how st3 falls so low. it is like all components are here....sweet strawberies , smoked cheese , chocolate , shripms , aged wine....was put in a blender."
135,"I love the first season. The story isn't very original, mixing the story of Akira (1988) with the Goonies, but it works well, with a good balance between 80s nostalgia, science fiction and horror.The second season is pretty messy, with more forced ""diversity"" shoved down your throat and a story that just tries to repeat the first season, without the mystery that made the first season intriguing.The third season is the worst in my opinion, being very cringy from the first episode, with all the characters acting like a bad sitcom, trying to make flat jokes that ruin the ambience. Following the feminist approach pushed by most Netflix shows once they are renewed, all the male characters are portrayed as goofy and stupid, while the intelligent girls save the day.And of course you wouldn't have a TV show in 2019 without.... EVIL RUSSIANS! Showing that the goal is clearly to produce propaganda rather than to entertain.Watch the first season, and pretend that it wasn't renewed."
136,"First, why does IMDB not allow you to rate a specific season? Season 1 was a solid 9. It's been downhill ever since. My rating for this review applies solely to season 3.When I saw Ars Technica deem season 3 ""the show's best season yet,"" my nasal cavity was immediately cleansed by the purifying power of Dr. Pepper. What a garbage take. Season 3 is by far the worst, and it's not even close. The Duffer Bros mailed this one in. My audible groans during the 8 episodes were legion. Bones of contention, in no particular order:Hopper and Joyce have become manic cartoon representations of their former selves. When they aren't shrieking at each other, they're...oh, wait, that's all they do this season is shriek at each other. Completely unhinged and overacted. I wanted to slap them both back to sanity.The ""subterranean-Bond-villain fortress full of uniformed Russian soldiers in the heartland of Indiana"" is simply laughable. When did Stranger Things become Austin Powers?The kid characters have passed their sell-by date. They've lost the adorable charm of yesteryear's youth and are now just grating teens.How many years will it take Eleven to learn to speak English without sounding like a 6-year-old halfwit? Come on, we're in season 3 and she's still enunciating her words syllable-by-syllable with a baffled look on her face like she's learning Mandarin???Haircuts: I was a young teen in the 80s. Guys that age at that time honestly did not wear bowl haircuts. Will and Mike look ridiculous. Ugh.Also, believe it or not, there were competent barbers in the 80s. We're looking at you, Jonathan.The Terminator-esque Russian soldier was just cringeworthy. A bridge too far here, guys.To outdo the addition of the Most Annoying New Character from season 2 (Max), they outdid themselves in season 3 with The Even More Annoying New Character (Erica). Someone please stick a fork in my ears!The mall battle was stupid. The end.An absurd plot, annoying characters, hysterical acting, and tepid attempts at 80s references (and fashion choices) make season 3 a complete disappointment. This story ran out of juice long ago, but Netflix will certainly try squeezing more blood from the turnip. I wish I hadn't spoiled the memory of my utter joy from season 1 by watching this steaming pile of dreck."
137,"When you run out of plot and end up filling it with cameo characters, casting mistakes and product placement, this is the result. Took over 20 separate viewings to struggle through this last season.Season 1 and somewhat 2, were plot driven with cutey references to the era, where as 3 just played on those same now-tired references without any character/plot development purpose other than keeping all the individual characters ""in play"".I feel sorry for the actors who have this as a blemish now. Luckily the kids will grow beyond it, but the adult actors just signed out of the business. One-string-Winona is a good example of that, it's the same scene she's repeating, and after the first lynching of her whining it deafens you out to the plight of her character.This wasn't worth the extra time to create the new season."
138,"This series was great in its first season, but season 2 and 3 were trash."
139,"Every season of 'Stranger Things' seems like an elaborate suspense-thriller franchise film. It has its start-middle-end and a definite season closure, though leaving a subtle seed for the next season. The show very interestingly creates a sci fi world (particularly in Season 1) and then explores different elements of suspense, thriller, fantasy, action, drama, comedy, romance, bromance and also horror (in some portions) very smartly and keeps you riveted all through. Thankfully it never muddles or messes up with its multiple genres.Each season follows a format where multiple tracks run in parallel from the very start until they merge together in the pre-climax and thereafter the group divides into smaller units to get set on one common mission in the finale. The format works perfectly for the show as it keeps its ensemble characters employed in different subplots and keeps you engaged with the variety. However, the editing pattern is so brisk that just when you expect to delve more into one particular track, the narrative erratically cuts into another plot and then another and then another. This happens largely in Season 2 and 3 and, at times, the pattern irritates. Another pattern is a match-cut transition from one scene to another which happens so often that it seems overdone. The pacing of the show is fast, not giving you any breathers to sit back and relax or analyse. Thankfully the makers have kept the flavour in true-blue suspense-thriller zone without making it a slow burn or dark drama.Beyond the premise and promise of an imaginative world, Stranger Things largely works because of its varied colourful characters. Whether it is El, Hopper, Joyce, Nancy or the four friends - each one is unique and has an interesting part to play. Also each character is written so robustly that you cannot pick any one of them as the central protagonist or rate anyone as the supporting cast. This is one of the few shows (or perhaps the only show) where almost every character has equal weightage, not just in screentime but also in their contribution to the story and also how you keep rooting for each of them. Even characters who seem to be just the supporting cast in the start come to fore more prominently over seasons. The best example is of Steve Carrington who comes across as the typical evil campus guy in season 1 but turns more likeable eventually. So is Erica, Max or Billy!The intrigue that was created in Season 1 dilutes down in Season 2 and 3 as you get more and more accustomed to the world. Season 3, in particular, stretches at times with an action track of a Russian mercenary chasing Hopper, resulting in some long-drawn-out action sequences in a fun-fair setup - something that seems forced and not in sync with the primary genre of the show. Then there is one break episode (Season 2, episode 7) that is just unconnected with the overall plot of the series and you aren't surprised when you see it is the lowest rated episode on IMDb. You could give this one a complete miss and still nothing would change in your viewing experience or story flow of the show.The show is subtly set in the early 80s era and the period reference is never in your face. The narrative is so gripping that you never consciously notice the absence of cellphones or other modern gadgets. Every episode ends on a definitive hook point which wants you to keep going ahead. Despite having adult overtones of creature horror and verbal abuse, the show still palpably captures the innocence of childhood friendship in a very organic way."
140,"Stranger things is a great show. Even though I don't like watching kids running around and weird sci-fi and monsters somehow it's still good.Season 1 is the 2nd best season behind season 3 and season 2 is the worst. Season one brings us to one of them being kidnapped and they keep trying to find him while eleven is trapped in a strange place. At the end of the season they find will and a mysterious portal. Season 2 shows us more of the under world and monsters and eleven is more of a main character. Season 3 the characters are older and the Russians are breaking the portal again to the underworld at the end they try to close the hole again and they do but Hopper is ""presumed"" dead and season 4 looks like it could be great"
141,"I don't know what to say but i have to force myself to watch this for the love of the first 2 season and my love for it.
It turned into a damn comedy and sarcasm.
Too much dialogue not enough mystery or suspense.
It's like one of them
""They're back, welcome your favorite characters!! Aren't they cool!!!! Give them a round of applause!!!""Closer to Back to the Future than Stranger Things Season 1-2.Sigh.DAMNI promoted the hell out of this to people that haven't watch the serious.
This one is an embarrassment. Not sure what to tell them after watching this."
142,"Season 3 keeps the same high standard for atmosphere, music and excellent camera work. Kudos for that.
But it drops the ball with shallow story and character development with a huge dose of 80s style anti-Russian propaganda forced at a viewer mixed with awkward product placements for a good measure.(Had to explain to my 9yo son what propaganda is is when he carefully inquired ""Dad, why all Russians are the bad guys in this movie?"")"
143,Season 1 was great and much on point was season 2. Season 3? I can't even following. The plot lines are so disjointed. I had to force myself to watch past the first episode hoping for the original vibe to return. Fail. Would not recommend. I will not be continuing on with this series. Netflix is just a garbage provider releasing titles just for numbers. I've cancelled my membership. Nothing more worth watching anymore.
144,The quality got progressively worse. Season 1 was better than season 2 and that was better than season 3. The kids got progressively annoying. The song between Dustin and Suzie in the final season was extremely agonizing. I am glad this was on Netflix though - easy to skip forward
145,"Boring.
In season 1 there were: monsters, action, mystery, magic! In season 3 only what you've got is one monster... and love, LOVE and more LOVE between every single character. So boring and disappointed."
146,"After the first two top-quality seasons, Season 3 is very disappointing, full of rehashed material and almost a parody of itself. Most episodes are full of padding, with characters waffling endlessly about irrelevant things, and side-stories sprouting all over the place. It has a few funny moments, notably when two teenage characters get stoned on truth serum in the penultimate episode. Otherwise this show could only appeal to bored pre-pubescents who want to know how to kiss or talk to the opposite sex.The most annoying thing about season 3 is that the main adult characters keep puffing on cigarettes in so many scenes, in some shameless promotion of tobacco. Other totally obvious product placements include the clearly inserted advertisements for Burger King and Coca-Cola. Let's hope Season 4 gets back on track, because this season's effort is a FAIL."
147,Nickelodeon has better shows with better scenarios and acting. Acting in season 3 is worst than some cartoons or even video games. Rubbish for the braindead.
148,"I was transfixed by Seasons 1 & 2 - they were brilliantly done.Season 3 made me drop a 9/10 rating to 6/10.I lasted 1.45 episodes of S3 and had to turn it off. Stilted, predictable, obvious, too much kitsch. All that was missing was the canned laughter, comedy sound effects and the sad trombone when someone made an oopsie.Disappointing."
149,"SO annoying. The only good thing was the music, beyond that it is un watchable. Russians? Really? So STUPID....."
150,"Season 1 was great. Original idea, thrill and suspense. By the end of season 1 I was very curious to watch season 2 and to know what kind of danger we have and how it will be defeated, but then it got quickly boring. Although the characters became more sophisticated and we understand their motives, the danger became repetitive. It is same thing we faced before, we know how to fight it, we are confident that we will win. With that feeling as an audience, it was not interesting for me to continue watching because the how and the what for the story was kind of obvious. Skipped to last couple of episodes in season 3, it became even more boring. The danger is exactly the same it just evolved a bit and became bigger. Laughably, neither the police nor the military noticed that a giant creature is destroying the brand new city mall that every one was talking about for so long until punch of kids killed the giant. This is when police shows up. Then we have the Russians who kidnapped an american police officer under the nose of the police from the crime scene. From the look of it, season 4 is going to be about the same thing again... no thanks."
151,"Series 1 was ok , 2 was a bit tiresome but 3 is just awful. Its like a show written by 14 year olds for a young audience.The plot holes are just huge. Wasn't there a grown up in the room to say, hold up that doesn't make any sense or if you do this then the result will be that. Nearly all the characters have been awful and selfish,I only got it to the end by hoping I would see the deaths of some of them."
152,"Just disappointed, i have no word to describe how bad 3rd season was.The plot changed from supernatural to political propaganda showing us that ussr especially russians are worst than creatures from another dimension.this season was pathetic..."
153,"The focus throughout on cheesy tween relationship drama is absurdly blind of situational context.The character interaction is less a mechanism for advancing plot and more an attempt to weaponize cringe.If the constant barrage of 80's pop-culture references hasn't put you into a nostalgia-coma then welcome to Team Monster, in the constant hopes that most of these characters will die soon.Make it stop."
154,"Season 1: Flawless
Season 2: Entertaining but cheap
Season 3: A jokeI don't want to give anything away, but if you are interested in watching this show, just watch the first season only and pretend if the following seasons never happend.As usual, the writers are lead by the success of the first season. After that it's a mixture of stolen ideas from various iconic movies. Or in other words: nothing new.Why not just stop after one successful season? This is exactly the reason why I hardly ever try to start watching a serie, and also why I've never finished one. Just write a story, with a beginning and an end which is already set. Don't be lead by the success and push it to the point where people are no longer stunned by the concept. Keep your old chlichés."
155,"It had some moments in the beginning. You can see from the get go that the plot is pretty forced. They closed the gate in s2 after all, right? Now the Soviets appeared lead by the Terminator and try to reopen the gate without absolutely anyone, including the FBI/ CIA noticing. Weak!By s3 the show transformed into a goofy comedy a la Scooby doo. Russians wander all over town and nobody notices. We're talking about random small town in the USA, not New York or LA. People disappear and nobody notices. Kids wander around secret underground lab and nobody notices. The worst in my opinion is what the mind flayer did in the end: assimilated all people and turned into a big useless monster that got fooled by a bunch of kids. That was his grand plan to kill eleven? It could have captured all of them if it retained all the individual pieces.
I'm not even going comment on the political agenda or the not-so-subtle product placement. At this point the only way it can be worse is if they try to make s4. Watch it for the nostalgia and the few good moments here and there, but nothing more. In conclusion, I got bored watching the last episode of s3. So disappointed compared to s1 and 2."
156,"Every season gets worse and worse, there's way too much filler now. I loved the first season but I should have known, like most shows, there is only one good season because the creators only really have plans for that one season and everything else is just a cash grab."
157,"The first 2 seasons were really good. Highly recommendable. But season 3 is sinking the ship (ahoy). The cool references, extra cash they spent on special effects (gore and other things), and bad language are all overdone. Most importantly, the story and storytelling was not good. The kids are losing their innocence, which is disappointing. This originally seemed aimed at bringing together tweens and adults to watch, but not sure I would want my kids watching this. This is an example of something that does a bad job of keeping a target audience. I get the feeling the Duffers are ready to move on. Me too."
158,"We loved season one, binged watched it in a weekend. Season two was interesting enough, but season three was unbearably awful: it was slow, predictable, and, I could not stand scenes with Erica. Kid was annoying!And for an 80s timepiece, what's up with no reference of ""the force""?! 🤓"
159,They ruined everything this season was too childish and eleven was so useless she did nothing and the idea of this season is trash compared to season 2 and 1 il rate season 1 10/10 and season 3 3/10
160,"Netflix created one of the most captivating and unique television series ever produced. ""Stranger Things"" created a cult following after the first season. The second season continued into the realm of ""Strange"" and captivating.
Hold on! Behold season three. Did they get new writers? Or did the regular writers sit back with a lackadaisical attitude saying ""We are on a roll. We got this!""
Well, whatever went down in the Netflix studios really went down.
This third season is the result of the mistaken idea that more is better. The only industry the made a killing ( pun intended) was the producers of the kids toy ""slime"" and who came up with exploding rats! The casting director must have gone to ""the home"" to cast an eighty year old broad who would eat fertilizer.
The histrionics of the actors made me wish they hadn't forgotten their meds during the shoot.
The only redeeming moments during season three was the acting of Gaten Mazarazzo and new comer Priah Fergerson. Although bordering on the hysteria of the rest of the cast they were the light in the darkness of ""the upside down""!
Maybe they studio should have named it ""Dumber Things""!"
161,The First season had a good Plot and the Second Season was even darker and had a even better Plot and Character Development but now in the third season many characters acted out of their before invented personality land had Many subplots that blocked the Main Plot which i had Problems getting into because it was so slow. Only the first 2 seasons were 8 points but with one of the worst third seasons ever made I have to change it to 6 points
162,"Season 1 was great. Season 2 went a bit overboard. Season 3 destroyed any faith I had in the writers and directors.A couple of things which were hard to ignore: almost every scene was designed to end in a crescendo. It got kinda tiring but I plodded through. Then I realised towards the last few episodes that the substance I expected to take form was not going to happen.I enjoyed the characters, the humour, the action, the 80s(!) vibe, but the overall plot was terrible and the dialog was weak. It felt softened up, overly-political, far too light-hearted and seemed to have lost all grittiness. I chuckled on a high of nostalgia, but that was about it. Nothing to excite or fear or think about.I did like the Mind Flayer's form (though not a fan of the 'possessed'), but the whole build-up and final battle felt empty.Hugely disappointed in season 3 because it had a great opportunity to build on previous seasons and instead almost intentionally fell flat."
163,"This season was so horrible, it made me write my first IMDB review. The series should have ended at Season 1. Hope they do not go on until it becomes a mess - if it even can become more of a mess."
164,"Netflix does it again! I'll admit, I was excited for this show just based on the genre it was listed as being in and so far it has not disappointed. With the exception of a few of the adults most of the cast was unknown to me which only adds to the level of immersion the show can reach. The two performers I was familiar with, Winona Ryder and David Harbour are both magnificent. A few things about Stranger Things are extraordinary and could only be done by Netflix. One, this show is suspenseful and engaging so waiting for a week to see the next episode would change the entire dynamic and would really be a bummer, Stranger Things must be binged! Second, the creators of this series are, like the young actors, unknown to me. Matt and Ross Duffer. Brothers that through conventional methods may not have had the opportunity to bring this show to life, get that opportunity from Netflix. In the past few years television has changed wildly. If you were a writer or actor five years ago you would much rather be a movie star than a television star, those distinctions have all but vanished. This change was brought on by many factors but I'd like to take this opportunity to applaud Netflix for their role. It is no coincidence that they started doing their own programming right around the same time these changes began. Bravo and please start filming season two of Stranger Things ASAP!"
165,"Formulaic, nauseating ad placement masquerading as nostalgia, cliched, weak plot, cardboard-cut-out characterisation, suspense destroying comedy."
166,"It goes from the mesmerizing season 1, where you're hooked to your tv and absolutely wanna know how everything will end, to a good season 2, not as good as the first but surely enjoyable, to season 3 where the show goes way down.Season 1: 9
Great plot, good acting, incredible soundtrackSeason 2: 8
Good plot, same incredible soundtrack with something newSeason 3: 6
A bit stupid plot, not so good acting, the soundtrack is ok but not majestic as the others.It lost it's sci-fi mistery notes to get an annoying teen drama way.
The whole thing is brought by S1 and S2, let's hope S4 (which is 99% sure) will take its revenge."
167,"I was love in this show since the premiere. Everything was perfect the cinematography, story plot, characters, actors, directing, art design and all. But new season have a serious flaws.
First, lack of expanding the world. They are still in the same town, with the same cast (more or les) and the same plot with the same big enemy. Why not something new? Where are other kids like Eleven introduced in season two? With the first season Netflix take a risk and brought to screen the project rejected by more then 10 stations and streaming services. Now they are making a marketing decisions. No more risk. No evolution, no new ideas. None.
Second, goofy action. First and second season had a perfect balance between horror and humor, between dark mood and goonie adventure. Now the tone is much more funny grotesque with ridiculous situations that not have any structural impact on plot but suppose to be funny or ""good"" looking. And this is another marketing decision.
SPOILERS!!!
Third, ridiculous ideas. The first two seasons were so gripping and tense because it could happen. Secret government facility, experimenting on children. Eleven was a tragic character and this is why we are so attached to her. Now we got gigantic Russian base in the middle of USA during Cold War filled with Russian soldiers in uniforms. Seriously??? And it just happen. How they build it? With spoons? Oh yeah the Mayor just cover up building a gigantic concrete base hundreds feet below the ground, Russian soldiers just come in trucks and they eat Burger King. Come on! Why so stupid stuff? Why not intelligent something smart? I know why and it's sad. Marketing decisions over artistic."
168,"I don't recommend anyone to watch this it's a waste of time. Not good for kids specially coz it's leads them to over fantasies which is really bad for their future.
I feel like I wasted my time."
169,"... Obviously they have new writers for Season 3. What used to be mysterious, intriguing and provocative is now as imaginative, sophisticated and engaging as an old ""Three's Company"" rerun."
170,"The 3rd season is in fact so bad, that it ruins the whole show. It's so childish, stupid and unrealistic. And when I say unrealistic I don't mean the monsters and all that crap, but rather how for example four kids can break into a millitary base, that kind of unrealistic. Stranger Things is a kids show masked as a horror show. If you're got an average IQ and you're over the age of 16, I have no idea how you will enjoy this, honestly. It's such a cringefest. I mean it always has been, but not to the extent that is shown in the newest season. Unbelievably stupid, and a waste of your time."
171,"1. season = 9, 2. season = 8,5 (except 7. episode - bad), 3. season = 1 (total garbage)..."
172,"Third series is quite a disappointment.
Character development is always important to a series, but too many 'Days of Our Lives' scenes ruin the moment. The show seems to jump between these scenes and of course, the supernatural ones, to a point where it feels like someone slammed the brakes on, then steps on the accelerator.
The monster now has lost its mystery and resembles other monsters; the bad guys are stereo-typed, and as far as Canadian productions go, there is always one run-of-the-mill gay person.
The drawcard was always the nostalgia and a mystery, but it appears that the writers have mysteriously resorted to 'old' ideas, and ended up with just a strange thing of a show."
173,"I don't know how they managed to turn a scary, interesting show into a teen romance comedy. They ruined everything. Just repetitive scary monsters and which one shot kills random people expect the main ones."
174,"The first season is intelligent, smart and original. The second one has less ideas and the screenplay is so so but overall can be ok. The third season is terrible: the screenplay is at the level of a B or C movie. Some scenes are terrible longs and especially the last three episodes are really terrible."
175,"Season 1 was a perfect setup, season 2 was great revelation, but why oh why season 3 is sooo lame and completely ruining the entire series...
I dont even know where to start, was already discusted from the beginning with all those kisses between mike n el, like cmon was that even necessary.
And then russian and the stupid storyline with so so many plot holes, its a complete mess. For thosr who've seen the first two, dont bother watching these or it'll ruin them all.
I had to change my rating from 9 to 6 just because this 3rd season..."
176,"Totally lost the thrill element of season 1.
The whole teen relationship thing seemed forced.
Joyce and Hopper turned out to into the most annoying characters.
Too much of comedy with most of them in awkward and unnecessary places."
177,Complete n utter demolition of all they built on season 1-2. ..
178,"Season 1 and 2 was so great. Season 3... errr... so so. Poor script, terrible ending, no misteries at all. Quite dissapointed. My rate is for the first and second. Third is just a 6."
179,"The first series started so well. Eerie, edge of your seat story, intense and very relatable nostalgia. The second season continued this intriguing story about El with great new characters, all ending in a huge finale - to which point, I'd have rated it a solid 8/10.
Now this third series has none of the good points it made in the previous two. News flash, the audience doesn't care about the awkward teenaged relationships (or anyone else's relationships). It's a huge waste of time that adds nothing to the story apart from delaying it.
They really should have kept with the story of El and the other 'Uber Soldiers'. They've separated the cast to expand the story but all it's done is dismantle what made it solid in the first place. Now it's just a cheesey boring storyline with some pretty horrific acting. So poor. What a shame. It's a 2 from me."
180,"After 2 great seasons and moderate expectations I was at stage to wanna skip parts of last series of season 3.First, the production value is great, no question about.
However, once great story, characters and horror now feels plastic, overdone with unbelievable cringe and stupidity. Russians in American Mall wearing military outfits - really!?
Half of our heroes act like they suddenly lost ability to think.
Acting is superb but the material is literally garbage.
80s referring are ok, again with overkill. I'm guessing this is the main reason for the high reviews.Sincerely hope that they will return our heroes to what they ware.p.s. real score for the season is 4, 3 is more as a statement"
181,"I am so very sad to write this review, I struggled and struggled to love season 3 but I was sorrrrrely disappointed. Many of the scenes dragged on and on and MANY storylines were not explained, such as the main one!! Why the F did the Russians even want to open the gate in the freakin first place?? And WHYYY WAS my beloved Hopper killed off?!?! WTF. He was pretty much my main reason for limping along with it. Just too much ridiculousness and sloppy story telling. It seemed they sacrificed any semblance of a coherent story for the campiness of over the top 80s nostalgia and not to mention beat- you-over- the -head product placement. Too much winking at the viewer with cutesy references. I'm done. Shark done jumped."
182,"Season 1 is quite gripping. The characters are fleshed out very well at the start, itself. The story is not predictable and it really feels like every bit of 80s sci-fi gold.Season 2, however, is like a bad X-Men comic and felt heavily bloated, uninspired and boring. Season 3 is more of the same, except the focus is a lot more on the kids' relationships with each other , which can be a good thing if done right, but it's not done too nicely here.Watch Season 1 and give the rest a skip, because this show is a lot hype and people buy into hype easily."
183,"Title says it all. Season 3 had no story line and it felt like it was thrown together. It looked like it was rushed just to get it out. Not waste you time watching season 3, you have already seen it in season 1&2"
184,"I wish there was like a rating for each Season on the front page of series.
So s1 was fantastic
s2 ok~good and
s3 subpar
the decline of the camaraderie and worse writing is why i think it got much weaker otherwise soundtrack,production and details still top notch."
185,"I normally don't review shows, but I'm a little miffed at having wasted 8 hours of my life on season 3. So I'm going to vent.I generally quit watching most TV shows and movies because of the banal plots, politically correct platitudes and disdain the industry shows toward their audiences. However, I stumbled upon the first season and thought it was fantastic. Season 2 was decent, but this recent season reminded me why I quit watching most stuff Hollywood vomits out of itself these days.All the other negative reviews here of season 3 are spot on, and echo my sentiments. I especially found the lesbian reference completely unnecessary, as was all the heavy-handed product placement. Winona Ryder falling in love again, only to lose him in a really stupid contrivance where she had to actually kill him off to save the world was just ridiculous. Sheesh!I found the stupid ""Neverending Story"" duet to be dumb, but upon further thought, maybe the writers were making a some sort of a wry statement about this particular story never ending. Oh, but it did end...for me!The teaser for season 4 (if Netflix manages to stay afloat) was a promise of more Russian stupidity. There was even a hint that maybe, just maybe, the sheriff isn't dead after all. Somehow they managed to spirit one of the monsters away to Kamchatka of all places. Face palm!"
186,First and second seasons were awesome. Third season is terrible. Really disconnected. Characters are just plain annoying. Lost its way. Bring back more of season one
187,"Season one was fantastic, season 2 kept things rolling. Season 3 is a poor concept riddled with inconsistent and weak characters (hopper, Joyce and max, Will), drawn out far too long and wrapped up so badly that a group of high schoolers could have done a better job. Haven't been so let down by a show's ending since how I met your mother."
188,"Season 3 is so poor, give up with this show, I have"
189,"I just started watching season 1 and I heard it's the best one. I hung in there till about half-way, just cause the series had such high ratings, but somewhere around the 5th episode I couldn't take it anymore.Of course I kind of want to know what happened to Will Byers, but the search for the missing kid is filled with lame, half-a** teenage drama between characters like Nancy, Steve and Jonathan who I'm not even half interested in. This is all to lead us away from the fact that the plot is completely empty and it seems as though they filmed the series without any plan whatsoever.Unfortunately the lame conversations between hollow characters that lack personality are worsened even further by the terrible acting of almost all the actors involved, with the exception perhaps of two of the kids.The character of Eleven is a true killer, in the worst way possible, especially because, even though she seems to speak English very well, she doesn't really speak and just keeps a blank stare on her face the entire time.So if you'd like to watch about 7 hours of endless good-for-nothing screaming and drama, this series is for you!"
190,"S1 and S2 : Masterpiece.S3 : Cringe fest.Doesn't feel like stranger things at all. And first 2 episodes are fillers. Everything was comedy with very little thrill, horror & darkness.Hoping they'll stop milking this franchise now because we don't need another cringy season.
If you are a kid or watching with your kids you'll like this predictable and poorly writing season.PS- Those saying it's 10/10 are same people who liked GOT season finale.
Maybe not a 4/10 but definitely not a 10/10.
Instead of watching this overhyped show go watch Netflix gem ""Dark""."
191,"I didn't even like season 1 that much. E.T. meets Alien, but the story doesn't make sense."
192,"I will go right on the point
they ran out of ideas for the story
...
because the story for this season is really bad and kinda repeated story
and the mystery element we used to like in this show is gone in this season"
193,"The first two seasons of this show were so good! I even rewatched them before the third season was starting. And then..the third season. What a letdown. It seemed like they were more concerned with putting in 80's references than keeping the shows interesting and engaging storyline from the first two seasons. If you're debating whether to watch the show or not, watch the first two seasons and stop there!"
194,"I don't even get the point why people actually love this show. The plot is an interesting if you have already watched Silent Hill, it is just a copy of that with a kid version. And it's not scary or interesting enough than silent Hill. Super overrated Show."
195,"The Duffer brothers have done an incredible job with this series. It has gotten better each season. Like most people season 1 grabbed my attention almost immediately and left me wanting more. Season 2 was just as good but had some dull moments. Season 3 is a genius mix of thriller, drama, adolescent love, and sci-fi with an 80's theme. Not a dull moment. A lot of these negative reviews are saying ""too much comedy"" or ""why evil Russians."" Well, the show is based in the 80's during the Cold War where The United States and the Soviet empire (evil Russians) were sizing each other up. So at this time all Americans thought all Russians were bad. Duh. The comedy portrayed in season 3 is not ""over the top"" or anything less than what would have been said at that age, in that scenario, in that timeline. So stop with the hating and praise the Duffer brothers on an incredible and unique story that entertains people all over the world. Thank you Duffer brothers keep up the amazing work!"
196,"Season 1 and 2 .... no need for review. Everyone knows how they were.Season 3..... Suddenly the kids are so... so irresponsible to each other that no one even contacting right from the beginning!! I don't know what they wanted to showcase... the only depth provided among the kids, was to Steve H., Dustin and Robin. (Spoilers ahead)
1> Jonathan and Nancy didn't even meet their brothers for a single time, except at the end in front of Mindflayer, to discus the peculiar events. Whereas, few years ago they did such a big thing together.
2> For the whole season, none of the 3 other boys and 2 girls tried to contact Dustin... Seriously!! After homecoming, just a single dramatic meet and all forgot Dustin?!! Even at the first encounter with Billy-mindflayer... None considered Psycho-tracking Steve or Dustin.
3> Then, the stupid sequences of Drama before Action, that were changing the course of Story forcibly so many times... unrealistic and annoying. They were taking so much time in doing so many small things.. even to count 1,2,3 before turning the Keys... but Hopper couldn't run back a few steps?? One can say, Hopper died because Suzi's song, really!!??
4> Billy suddenly sacrificed his life to protect the kids, just because of his mother's memory was retold to him?? It was as stupid as Zack Snyder's Batman listening to 'Martha'!!
5> Lastly, Eleven(El) was such a annoying character for the whole season. Every time she used her power, she had to show her might in her face, even for a little door opening. I wonder why they didn't sacrifice El in the stupid story rather than Hopper!!Overall, Season 3 was hurried fan service. They were not prepared at all to make this. Poor direction and poor character building. 5/10
Season 1: 9/10
Season 2: 8/10"
197,"Are the best adjectives I can come up with for this ridiculous show. (Given some time I am sure I can think of a few more.)
I have never written a review on IMDB, but, in this case, just had to.
Based on the many excellent reviews my husband and I watched the first episode last night. The opening scene was actually quite good until about three minutes later when the cameras turned to annoying, loud, argumentative, obnoxious, and completely harebrained kids.
With the good reviews in the back of our heads, we felt it just had to get better so watched the second - then the third episode which introduced young school bullies, teenagers who made fun of and bullied someone who wasn't one of them, drank, lied to their parents about where they spent the night, and were quite easy about having sex. Considering there wasn't even a good story line, this is when I said enough is enough.
Is this behavior so common that we have become quite immune to it - even accepting it as part of our 5 star entertainment? Or is this just another example of the 'dumbing down of America'? Evidence in favor of the latter is found in the claims of some that 'Stranger Things' is the best sci-fi they have ever watched. What happened to Fringe, Star Wars (even the first three episodes knocked this nonsense out of the ballpark), The Star Trek spin-offs etc. And, although in a slightly different, category have we forgotten Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit? Want low budget? Try Coherence or The Man from Earth and the many like it (Disclaimer: Probably not intended for Stranger Things fans)
Today, it has become increasingly popular to just keep writing episode after episode with no ultimate goal in mind. As long as they can keep churning out something they can foist on an undiscerning public - they make money. At least the first season of Once Upon a Time had a very good story line with a beginning, a middle and an end, before they started meandering all over the place.
So two questions.
Who was this made for? Half witted kids or their adult counterparts.
What were you thinking Winona Ryder?"
198,Season 1 deserved all the hype. Amazing.Season 2 was ok.Season 3: don't bother
199,"Season 3 felt more like a parody than an ""normal"" season. I don't understand the hype about it, for me it was just MEH."
200,"I expected better than the mess that season three was. It could have been so much better.This should have been about the kids versus the world. Not the kids versus each other. I hate how they used Hopper to create unnatural conflict between the kids. Perfect way to ruin the character who used to be my favorite.Dividing the groups in genders was very cringy. Max and eleven should never be with each other. Max is a horrible character and never had any chemistry with Eleven.""There's more to life than stupid boys"" -Max the mad maxi padThat was max's way of ""enlightening"" Eleven.Constant and Mindless banter and bickering involving Dustin with Erica, and Steve with Robin.My little pony conversations? Seriously? And the Constant bickering between Erica and Dustin about who is more of a nerd.This horrible dialogue took me out of the moment and ruined all suspense.Dustin singing never ending story was horrible. It was so unbearably out of place and long. The song isn't the problem, the problem is that the song felt like it would never end, and was so poorly placed. Singing while people are dying is what this cheesy disaster of a show has turned into.I can't believe anybody actually liked this season after seeing that!This show was supposed to be a deep science fiction drama series. Not a useless cringe-inducing and shallow sitcom.Having Robin come out as a lesbian was so unnecessary. Why not put effort into making the dialogue serve the plot instead of showing that you're culturally sensitive? Stop trying to use an 80's themed show to fix the past or something. Just stop. Robin never fit in with the other characters anyway.Why are the Russians there and trying to open the gate?Why was this season a useless redo of what we already saw except with more useless bickering and cheesy Russian costumes?Maybe we are expected to watch season 4 to find out, but I have lost all interest."
201,As the title says you cant go wrong with stranger tings. A huge traffic builder for Netflix and rightly so
202,"Season 1 is ok, 2 improves and 3 is way too sci-fi. Just my opinion, but I reckon an unnecessary plot twist at some point that didn't fit me."
203,"Series 1 was great
Series 2 was ok
Series 3 was predictable and repetitive
It has turned into a kids programme
The 80's novelty is not enough to watch it for
The dialogue is lettered with current expressions, which really ruins the little atmosphere
I was willing the last episode to finish
Talk about slow
The last ten minutes feel like an hour long
Looks like there could be a series 4
Not for me!"
204,"On just the first 2 seasons it was an 8 for me, but sitting and struggling through the first few shows of season 3 and I just don't know how I'm going to push myself to watch episode 4, I really don't. Medication might be the answer.In order to drag out a season 4,5,6... a stupid idea has been installed, and without giving too much away, I won't refer to Invasion of the Bodysnatchers.Terrible, just terrible."
205,"I didnt have high expectations for season 3 but this was shockingly bad. Unoriginal, predictable, and cringeworthy. I loved season 1 and 2 but this really got out of hand and silly. So many unnecessary additions and quite far fetched ones at thar. The writing was sloppy and the characters became incredibly annoying. Poor writing and pacing, in my opinion. (I do lovr the music though!) To those who feel the same, i cant recommend enough watching the netflix series Dark. Out of this world writing and innovative concept... The first 2 seasons will blow your mind! Masterpiece!"
206,"The magic they got in the first 2 seasons...they lost it in season 3. far too much dialogue, attempted humor in every (i mean every) scene takes all the tension and darkness out of it..the main characters from the first 2 seasons are no longer who they used to be....they have all turned into stupid morons who stand around arguing about inane irrelevancies at the height of the action in an attempt to inject humor (always in the wrong places) Overall, season 3 is badly written, lacks any real tension, tries far too hard to be funny, far too much dialogue and far too little story. Very disappointing, but not really surprising...season 1 = 9/10. season 2 = 8/10. season 3 = 6/10. i think the outlook for season 4 is more of the same....stranger things has now morphed (degenerated more like) into your typical ensemble cast drama/comedy/horror/comfort food entertainment series. Still satisfying in places, still has its moments but nothing special like S1 and S2 to an extent."
207,"Season 1 & 2 were great so expectations were high for 3!!
Season 3 was a total let down in most areas. It all seemed a bit lost and not quite sure where it was with itself. With under cover Russian spy's hiding under a shopping mall to terminator type Russian maniac running around (well walking) killing everyone and the very poor slap stick comedy and one liners it kind of lost its intenseness and suspense that 1 & 2 had. With writers throwing 80's nostalgia at you with every single chance they got and goofball humour it kinda took away from what stranger things was originally about, the whole science fiction/ horror feel. It was there in small doses but was lost between chaotic and slapstick storylines between various character types. Overall I was really disappointed and left wanting a bit more. Could of been so much better."
208,"In a nutshell, season 3 was a regression. No character development, one dimensional plot line. They seem to have run out of steam already."
209,"Season one blew my mind away, but season two was more of the same and season three was basically disappointing. So, the series started at a 9/10, but then became a 7/10 and finally ended with a 5/10. Somehow the actors lost their spark - maybe the fame got into their heads. Sorry, but season three just didn't do it for me. The Silent Hill effects were completely gone in season three and that somehow interrupted the flow of the series. Still a good effort though. Having said all of this - highly recommend watching the series 'Dark'. It makes you rethink your rating for 'Stranger Things'. 'Dark' is what 'Stranger Things"" should have been 100% of the time."
210,Probably the best TV series of all time. I can't stop watching it again and again! Especially the Season 3..... No one can compete with it!
211,Season 3 is boring. All the characters are way over the top and hokey. The writing was trash. They made every male character the enemy. Hoping it turns around but the way the world is working it's not looking good for any show.
212,"Here are some ideas for improving season 4:1. Kill Erica
2. Kill Max"
213,"I wonder how long will it take for people to realize this show is actually bad. While season 1 was good, and season 2 relatively mediocre, season 3 isn't even watchable. This show is so rapidly declining in quality that I'm just left wondering if I'm even watching the same thing anymore. It's become nothing but a prolonged commercial for the 80s."
214,"Should have stopped it at season 2.Characters that has become annoying areLucas
Will
Jonathan
Mike"
215,"A kid's show with adult language. Cliche after cliche. I don't even know how i got to the third season, but in the first 10 minutes i felt dirty for watching this garbage, i felt like i should be paid for watching this. I feel cheap after those 10 minutes, like i have been taken advantage of... i should sue somebody."
216,"I suppose if you are under 14 years old you could accept it. But then again you wouldn't ""remember"" the 80's tacky pop music that saturates almost every scene. But oh yes don't forget it's a ""slow burn"" where almost every character is either annoying or wacky or both. I'm sorry but I don't buy it."
217,"Netflix has spread the hype of this tv show and tried to make it more than it really is which is mediocre. The show's story doesn't seem to be proceeding in any way. It's always the same storyline manipulated into slightly different direction from the previous season. Extremely overrated and utterly boring. After the first season, you are basically watching it over and over again with a slight change."
218,"Surfing through the best series in IMDB ratings, you can find Stranger Things up there. Season 1 brought a lot of freshness to the table with it's 80's theme and well chosen actors. Those kids will win you over quick and you just see the natural aura going on the set. It really felt like an adventure you want to be part of, by going through every single episode. Fair to say that 2nd season carried through well, as it managed to bring new ideas to the table and season one would have required a proper ending. I wouldn't want to go into detail with these seasons, as they were nearly perfection in my opinion. You just have to see it for yourself.Now I wish that the 3rd season had not had happened - at least not this way. I feel that it is no surprise, as film companies now try to milk out every cent of successful series or movies, till it becomes unbearable. I felt that they had tried to dumb it down for mainstream watchers, but that was not the fan club you built this show up from. I'd rather not go into the dialogues and humor (which felt very awkwardly forced upon this season), as it seemed to be the least of this season's problems. I'm just going to count up the problems that made me lose any interest for the series:
1) Actors with their attitude and relationship problems. It felt that the main characters all had to be paired up romantically. All series shouldn't feel like some reality TV show on MTV, where you just put a group of people together and every one develop feelings. These are just episode fillers, that you have to sit through, as nothing else is going on.
2) Time management. The whole season felt like it's put together as if sometimes time runs still and other times are fast forwarded. Opening the gate, building of the Mind Flayers - at times it felt it was happening so fast and all of the sudden, it all froze, as it was not the season finale yet. Then, when it came to switching locations that were far away to help your friends or closing the gate - it happened in a heart beat.
3) The whole story. Russians, and their uniforms; secret underground base, which is ""heavily guarded"". Oh boy, how I would not have gone there - Russians?! The Russian terminator that took his joke role too seriously. It felt like suddenly robots have been introduced to the series, that I have missed out on. It wouldn't have been so bad, if he was meant to be somebody significant and who got plenty of screen time. Somehow had to stand out of all the Russians, who were already after every one. The secret base, which dropped all the way to earth's core, it's corridors unnecessarily long and empty, where every Russian footsoldier wore a uniform. You are trying to blend in with your secret base and you wear a uniform? And after all that seriousness it was like the creators of the show dropped every logic when they made it to a children's playground, where you could almost walk around with no security. Finally the overly powered Mind Flayer, who freeroams around the city, being unstoppable. The only ones to be concerned about it, are the kids with the help of their parents.In conclusion:
Season 1-2 were superb and season 3 lacked of thrills and story. Even at the very end (the sneak peak to season 4), they left no hope for this fading show to end with season 3. Hard to give a fitting rating to this show, as it's probably near 5/10 in the end of season 4."
219,"S01 ok. S02 not good. S03 worst ever.All male characters are clumsy fan idiots or evil enemy monsters.All female characters are smart know-it-all geniuses or have superpowers or superinsticts.I'm not against the hole Russia-America Cold War theme, after all it was an important matter those days but would have preferred less of that an more of the monsters.Dialogs are so childish and predictable they endup boring. If it's a kids show then why the gunpoint killing? Why the adultery suggestion?If you need to add a character and want it to be gay why link her to one of the main characters?. I mean, why charge the male with even more than the already idiotic ignorant loser just-sex looking personality you already gave him and give him also the shame of pursuing love in a ""closet charcter"".Not expecting the next season at all."
220,"The 80 and 90 was a very attractive to tell the truth, being honest, I would have liked to live at that time, and that may be one of the main reasons why Stranger Things attracts people's attention so much, which includes the fact of that the series is of mystery, terror, and that is what season 1 offers you, a series of mystery, terror and some comedy since the protagonists are children, but the point is that season 1 is serious when you have to Being serious, the series wants you to take it seriously and it's fun because when it has to be fun, it's entertaining and telling the truth to the characters if they have personality, maybe it's not the most developed, but at least they have it, if you are It is very likely that a child identifies with the characters.Well, season 1 is great, it has an interesting plot, acceptable characters, a very good environment, it's like a very good parody of ET but it's better, then season two arrives and now it turns out that an essence of the monster got inside Will, and the truth is that from now on, the series does not care if you entertain yourself, the only thing that interests you is to extend at any cost, and at this point the series does not care and has things that lack It makes sense that Nancy and Jonathan get into the super secret lab to talk to the new scientists who investigate the super secret portal and they ask them questions and they answer them with all the honesty in the world and let them go, despite being told Super secret information, but good to tell you the truth this season is not so terrible, since it adds a very nice character to Bob Newby, this is probably the best character for me, but as the saying goes ""The good goes away and the bad he "", as Bob will know, he dies and we stay the same, except for the other two characters that this season brings us, but that the truth does not add much to the plot, then after all that and an unnecessary filling episode, the protagonists win by closing the portal and to tell the truth the series could have ended there, but as I said the only thing that matters now is to extend.
Then comes the disastrous season 3, where the introduction of the characters is more entertaining than the main conflict, at this point the series is already a mediocre and boring series, I say each season is only a pretext, in the second result that Will had visions and that the monster never left and is within it and in this third season now it turns out that although they closed the portal one of the monsters stayed in his world and that Dustin builds a radio to communicate with his girlfriend but detects the worst protected Russian broadcast, we also have Russians that are faster than a bullet, more than predictable moments, and ruining how little good they did as Hopper's death that turns out to be alive so really the letter that eleven reads at the end does not It is worth nothing, I bet that in season 4 the conflict will be like one of the monsters pregnancy with Will and they have to help him or such nonsense, but if this series you still like it then better for the creators Since they will continue to earn money, it is for all the above said, I consider that Stranger Things in general is a 6/10."
221,"I will not return for S4, but would be down for a movie!Although I loved Season 1, I was never under the nostalgia-hypnosis, so I really held back on recommending this show until I saw something more original. S2 developed the characters, expanded the lore, and built on the quirks we had in S1. S3 does none of this, and merely puts our characters on a hamster wheel, shakes the cage to make them fall, and then sluggishly puts them back on.The story does not move forward. No mystery. Eerie. Intrigue. Just blood, gore and product placement."
222,"I loved the first season
I enjoyed the second
But in the third it turns out that this is it!
The story is still about this scary monster and nothing is new and I'm not as thrilled as I was in the first season and it's now boring and I think thisbis enough for this show but you know Netflix they can't end a F ing show until it's turns to garbage
Season 1 9/10
Season 2 7/10
Season 3 5/10
All in all 7/10"
223,"Season one was master piece
Season two was watchable
Season three is simply garbage"
224,"Very few series manage to maintain a high standard beyond the first season or two. For me, one that did (and is an exceptional tv series in a similar vein to stranger things) is The X-files. The X-files first 2 seasons are very good. But seasons 3-5 are generally considered the classic x-files seasons, and rightly so. Here was a show which went from very good to even better and maintained the highest standard right until the end of season 5. (and we are talking 24 episodes per season!) What's the difference?
The show stayed on the track it started out on, maintaining the same winning ideas it introduced in the first season, expanding upon them without abandoning them. OTOH, Stranger Things abandoned most of what made it so good in the first 2 seasons and in season 3 for some reason tried to be a totally different show. There was no continuation of the original vision or even the characters in season 3. There were a few good threads - the backstory of Billy and his final redemption for me was the best thing in season 3. The character of Robin was also worthwhile. All in all i think they had about 3 episodes worth of material, the rest was just unnecessary padding out (and tedious at that)
It would not surprise me if the whole 'evil russians' theme (which was so absurd) was paid for by outside political entities to be in the show to help push their own current anti-russian propaganda, ironically the US government secret services who were the villians of season 1 & 2, now become the 'cavalry' who show up at the aftermath.
Virtually every single aspect of the show went downhill in season 3. Except one thing, the budget obviously went up big-time. The whole production budget multiplied by many times, including salaries - the result - a way-worse show. Interesting how that works."
225,A childish series so overhyped for I simply cannot understand why. There are a few other series of the same genre that have gone literally unnoticed because of the overhype of this childish series made for 9 yr old kids..
226,"I don't want to include spoilers here, so there won't be any details on how I feel about the plot. However, acting is so far very shallow, without direction, painfully trying to revive the ghosts of the past but failing. Timing is abysmal, the story drags it's hobbled little feet like it's been mauled with an axe. After first episode I said ""ok, we'll see..."" Now, I'm having trouble finishing the second in two attempts. Oh boy, did this show really have to crash so sadly? MBB is trying so hard (and failing) that I feel embarrassed for her. What was a good match for the first season proves to be a failure in third - she-actress actually didn't ""play"" an empty-shell character, she IS empty and it shows."
227,"Little or nothing good to recommend here.It's a race to the bottom, with the only interesting being in trying to work out which is worse - the writing, or the acting.Save yourself some hours you won't get back - watch a few episodes of the worse soap opera you have to hand - the writing will be better, the situations more believable, and the acting probably far superior. The popularity of this rubbish is a complete genuine mystery to me. Rubbish...utter utter rubbish."
228,"Highly recommended you stop at season 1Season 1 was the highlight literally could of ended there. 80's nostalgia Super 8 vibe. Season 2 was eh, season 3 is just utterly stupid in the level of cliche and stupidly unrealistic things that happen.They even have a villain look like the cop from terminator, never seen writing go downhill so badly.Running through a highly secure area like it's nothing check.Hospital that looks like left 4 dead with it's monster check.Every time eleven uses her powers we must see blood coming out of her one nostril or else we wouldn't know she used her powers.God can go on forever not worth the breath."
229,"First season is the only good season. This is becoming show for teenagers only, its so cringey its unwatchable. Very poor writing full of cliches. I give it 2 stars only because of good photography and color in show."
230,"The first season 1 is perfect. Great story, good acting and i love the 80's atmosphere. Season 2 is still good but season 3 is really garbage. The actors became annoying (a lot of arguing and stupid conversationele) and it became really childish."
231,"Season 1 was amazing. It was innovative, novel, entertaining, perfect. Season 2 went downhill for me, but I still liked it. Season 3 is an absolute mess. I don't think anything makes sense, and in my opinion, it tried to compensate for its lack of an actual plot with just throwing in a ton of violence that had not been in the previous seasons, and a ton of cliches, throwbacks to the 80s (which I did appreciate being an 80s child myself, but it's not enough to save the season). After being left wanting more after seasons 1 and 2, I found myself hoping during the ending credits of season 3 that they would just end the whole thing and not show any additional footage of a potential story of season 4, but, alas, they did. Here's to hoping they can get season 4 back to where the show was in season 1. Let's end on a good note."
232,"5/10 because I had to watch it to the end because of my love of the previous series.It's all been said before, marginal rehash of s1/s2 with way more comedy, sarcasm and quite cringey acting (Hopper and Joy) - it's also not as fun to watch more we all know Millie Bobbie Brown is a stuck up spoilt brat in real life.Netflix should end it after s3, you can't make it any worse."
233,"Seen: Season 1-3.Season 1 and 2 were excellent.Season 3 is boring. It started with ""simply not very spectacular"" for S3E1-3, but then it quickly became really really boring for the remaining episodes. Each of the story telling lines were boring and the overall goal of the season 3 was boring.Usually I try to describe the individual plot holes or badly designed scenes or ideas or characters. Herein, I liked absolutely nothing. Its actually amazing how the same people were able to produce season 1+2 and then release something like season 3.Summary: Season 1: 9 points, Season 2: 9 points, Season 3: 1 point.
--> 6/10 stars."
234,"The plot, the characters, the actors, the music... everything in this TV show is amazing. This is one of those series that you know will develop a sort of like cult following because of how well thought out it is and entertaining. I was so involved emotionally with the characters in a way that I have never been.This will be one of Netflix's most precious jewels. Strangers Things can be best described as fusion television at its best. You have intensive consuming drama, nail- biting thrills, terror and just the right touch of action for what decisively makes for a ten-star TV series.The talent of the writers is matched by the actors. Great job all around on the election process for this great team."
235,"...but not funny. Unnecessarily long and pointless, full of plotholes and the storyline is lame to say the least. Wynona is overacting and the kids cannot save the very poor script. I will not even mention the Russians, most have captured this ridiculousness better than me.
The ending suggests there will be another season but I seriously doubt it after the public outrage. Even if there is one will definitely not bother watching it."
236,"The Season 1 was interesting... with very good feelings of 80's. The story was good, the characters were authentic, It was funny theyblundered everythings... The season 1 was good. 8/10The season 2 was a lacklustre replica.... not more 5/10The Season 3 was a bad season... Banal, corny, foolish, laughable, boring, impeached, 2/10"
237,What happened? Seasons 1 and 2 were so good and then season 3 came along and ruined it all. Too much silly relationship drama and not enough plot. At one cringeworthy point it even turned into a musical from hell. Bring back the good writers please or I will not be watching season 4.
238,"Season 1 and season 2 are super awesome.. I had recommended to so many. But this season 3, I am never gonna watch this series any more. They must have shown the source of stranger things. Instead they are showing source of some non sense memory of Billy.
And by just telling that memory, billy became normal.. But his sister is live there in front of him, it is not impacting him.
Unnecessary episode of rats story has been added. They could start it with Billy's accident. The plot created was non sense. The links to the different stories are non sense. The cop's role was so boring and and he did so much of over acting. Episode 1 to 4 is time waste. The story picks up the speed from ep5.Very disappointing story.Country is dying.. No armies are active specially on Independence Day.. Children has to save the town.. and On that Sushy has to sing a song..Amazing slow claps and rotten tomatoes.."
239,"Too much romance and clichéd stuff same scenes and too much predictable.. Not that good , s2 and 1 were way better but do watch it for s4"
240,"I would give this show a 9 or 10 but I can't. The first season is just amazing and brings the 80's nostalgic feel to the show. Season 2 is was just god awful, and season 3 was okay but still had a nice feel to it."
241,"Not enough CGI to cover the actors this time. This season peppered with lots of screen time for the stars. Moments of nothing, banal chats about teen angst, parents wondering where their children are..and all along in the background the story, much like the monster, seems to come to a climax all on its own."
242,"Just to make it clear, my rating is based on the average of the 3 seasons combined. More of a 6.5/10I don't understand, Was season 3 meant to be for another show with same cast? Or did the writers get bored ?
I mean Russians?? Really?
Season 1 & 2 were pretty good with some flaws of course(still not one of the best shows thou). But season 3 ?? What? What has happened?
Teen show much? Love? Stupidity? Comedy?
A bunch of annoying teens are saving the city?
And please if you're to create season 4, please kill Erica, Mike and basically reduce the stupid scenes that aren't making any sense.Thanks for the effort, but the show went downhill, really."
243,First two seasons were pretty good. Third one comes along and everyone wants to be too cute by half. Unwatchable.
244,"Let me start by saying I love season 1. I thought it was the perfect start for young horror fans and it was able to boost Netflix's popularity so they could go on and make more originals, such as Dead to Me, Big Mouth, The Babysitter ect. It was perfect and I wouldn't change a thing.
However,
But the time season 2 rolled along, I started to roll my eyes. I thought it was good, but nowhere near as amazing as the 1st season. It felt a bit unfocused at times and very forgettable. I remember every plot point in season 1, and about 2 scenes in season 2. And if you want to see one of the most pointless and out of place episodes in the history of TV, watch the 7th episode of season 2. But it did wrap all the stories up nicely and gave us a satisfying ending.
Until now,
Season 3 was great, it was so much better than season 2 and felt like the show found it's feet again. But because of my distaste for season 2, I no longer cared for the characters. All of the big character driven, heart felt scenes that are made to make teenage girls cry their eyes out, and the chemistry between the characters, no longer felt like something I could identify with and therefore it made me feel a bit bored, wanting it to just hurry up and finish.
And thank God it did.
Season 3 perfectly ends the show. All the characters have reached the end of their progression. They have nowhere else to go. Done, completed, now let's move on.
But wait, THERE'S MORE!!!
My instincts tell me that Netflix has already ordered Season 4, completely ruining the ending of 3. Don't over milk the cow! Everyone will be satisfied if the show ends here, and we can move on and Netflix can make more influential originals. But knowing American TV shows, they will milk the cow dry, leaving a sour taste in everyone's mouth, when we should be remembering what a great show it was."
245,Season one is really original and fresh. Great fun. But frankly that was it. In season two it is like they are telling the same story over again. Only the kids are not as charming as in the first season (they grow up after all). So my advice must be: Stop after season one. If you continue you will be dissapointed.
246,"Season 1 great
Season 2 mediocre
SEason 3 a total disasterThis ended up like show for kids"
247,"The definition of insanity is often said to be doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. Not that it's the actual definition, but I've heard that more times than I care to remember... And don't get me wrong.. I love Stranger Things.. but I feel that's where this show is going. It's just the same story over and over every season. Sure they have loveable characters and they are continuously building them, but each season has the same base, the same premise. Each season ends with what seems to be ""closure"" to this world and each season finds new means to open the gate. The same story just told a little differently each time. At some point the gate will have to close or the worlds will have to permanently collide. I don't know how I feel. Dark may have ruined Stranger Things for me. It's not that I'm comparing them, because they're absolutely nothing alike. Dark is so much deeper than ST, and on a totally different level...but I felt like the story really moved forward where ST is on an endless loop. Hopefully next season will take us somewhere different, but if they continue on this way.. they're really going nowhere fast."
248,"Just finished Season 3 and not gonna lie...I didn't love it. The innocence and youth is what made this show so great the first season. It can't be topped. Maya Hawke had no business being in this. She's not talented enough to cover for being unattractive and she's not attractive enough to cover for having no talent. Big misstep. When they gotta throw in LGBTQ+...well it's not natural to the storyline so it feels forced and pandering and then you know they just lost the plot. They are going back in time but adding today's issues just so they can cover all the bases but it takes you out of the storyline and all you do is say ""Oh yep! That's the director checking off that box."" And killing Hopper?! I mean I guess he could still be alive but geez! What a downer. And where the hell is Joyce moving to? Did she magically find another job that requires no brains or skill that would actually pay enough to enable her to afford a move? And why does the oldest son have to go with them? He could stay in town to be with Nancy. And who would buy their dump of a house anyway? Why did they make this season about Billy? I didn't care about him last season so I didn't care that he died in this season. Sadie Sink...bug eyes are all I see when she's onscreen. Why are they trying to make her happen? She's no looker yet she's doing modeling campaigns now. Caleb McLaughlin? We've given him 3 seasons now and it's official...he CANNOT act.
I thought Paul Reiser died last season? Carey Elwes found Botox. Ugh! And c'mon I knew we'd see Dustin's girlfriend at some point BUT singing an entire song while people are dying that could've been saved if they hadn't done that?! Dumb and cringeworthy.So what's good? Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Natalie Dyer (killing me with her handling of all the guns!), Brett Gelman (hated him last season but this one he was funny). I'd like to add Joe Keery because he was fantastic last season but this season?! He acted like a completely different character from the first two seasons so I kept thinking ""What is going on? What happened to Steve?!"" I will give them credit for all the 80's references as they were spot on and really took me back to those years.Wish Sean Austin wouldn't have been killed off. He was great last season and would've elevated the show this season.Such huge buildup for this season. Waited a long time and then we get what we got...left me feeling like ""Meh"" and wishing it would've ended after the first season so it could remain perfectly preserved as truly great in my mind. It kills me that such a great show went off the rails after season 1 and now they're just floundering. So disappointing. Everything we see after this is just gonna be reactionary which just kills it for me. They can't top the first season so now they're just gonna focus on being over the top. Duffer Brothers...please just don't."
249,A masterpiece?You got to be kidding me!A comedy for kids rife with teen age sexual tendencies.
250,"Can't understand the following that this has. This show has not got an original idea in it's head. It's like watching The Force Awakens 3 times in a row!
The set up of character and story is exactly the same with every season, with annoying characters and stupid sub-plots thrown in for good measure.Season 1 IS NOT brilliant television which some people will tell you it is. This is not The Wire or The Sopranos. This show isn't in the same Galaxy as those classic TV Shows.The first season copies everything from The X-Files to Stephen King to nostalgia Spielberg films from the 80's. It also plays on the 'there's a government conspiracy cover up'. Because we haven't seen that before have we.Season 2 has the same set up about a place called the upside down where a monster comes from so the kids get together (like they did in S1)
They have to fight a monster (like they did in S1)
Eleven has to defeat the monster (like she did in S1)
Season 2 is actually worse because this has a 7th episode that has absolutely nothing to do with the episode prior or after it and can be ignorned completely. They only put this in because Milly Bobbie Brown wasn't getting enought screen time and clearly her agent was upset about this!! If you have seen any of her press conferences with her co-stars she clearly has to be the centre of attention and everything has to be about her!!Season 3 starts with yet another monster coming over from another dimension and yep you guessed it the gang get back together and Eleven saves the day yet again. At no point during this overlong and tired series do you fell that any of these kids are going to be in danger.
Season 3 is by far the worse however as they fell the need to force left wing politics into it's storytelling just like the trash Disney films are doing.
There is also a ridiculous subplot between Winona Ryder and David Harbour that fells that is should be in another show. It's just them arguing that fells like an episode out of Eastenders.Non of these characters have progressed over three seasons. Eleven is as powerful in Season 3 as she was in Season 1. The character arcs are terrible that have no development. They are there to serve a creature feature.
The effects are ok but you've seen all this before. The kids are average but nothing special even though they are clearly written as The Goonies.Season 4 threatens to do the exact same predictable and boring set up with no emotional pay-off. At this stage I am completely uninvested in any of these characters because S4 will follow the same predicable and safe formula.Hugely overrated!!"
251,"Stranger things woke up great memories from the past. Walkie talkies, friendship, adventures of friends, the music... and many things to go on.
I really enjoyed watching the first two seasons, it made me thirst for the next episode.Then it comes the season 3... oh my god I wish I never watched it. There are so many great topics that had been left off the script and I was watching meaningless fights and walking/driving.Guys get a grip!
You proved you can do better than filling episodes.I hope you do better if there is season 4."
252,At last i found worse writers than the guys who wrote GoT...What a ridiculous season 3 you created???Are you real???Any comparison to Chernobyl or brwking bad or even Dark is still mply not in place.Seasin 3 of stranger things (as well as GoT last season) is something that should be avoided regardless of cost or anything...Really embarrassing...
253,Better plot than season 2. More 80's pop rock & more gory than ever! All you fans are in for a treat! I'd rather watch the whole season 3 again than fireworks at forth of July!
254,"I'm sorry fans, and bingers. S2 nor 3 really did it for me. 3 just had way to too much nonsensical unnecessary banter scenes between all the of the cast. And it really took away from the whole sci-fi experience of what the made a show a hit in S1. It was just was long and drawn out and and I was more excited about getting to the end of this season then watching it. Way too much conversation about nothing and it killed it for me. If there is a S4 (after the credits you get a glimpse that it might be one) I will not be indulging. I'm done with the series."
255,"I don't understand why they decided to go for a complete tonal shift in season 3, when compared to 1 & 2. Season 3 went with a full on horror/comedy route leaving behind the heart and character development that was so prevalent in seasons 1 & 2.
And don't get me started on those painfully embarrassing product placements. Weirdly after season 3 , for once in my life I'm not looking forward to season 4. Something tells me they've lost the magic touch completely. It's going to go down the Micheal Bay route from now on, more explosions and more monsters. I'd like to remember Stranger Things for seaonss 1 & 2, for me Season 3 never happened."
256,"I was the same age of the characters in 1985 and love the nostalgia and excellent attention to detail, but the use of corporate logos is HEAVY, product placement high and royalties to Madonna looking pretty steep."
257,I lived for the slow acting and finally a show that was funny and the kids had scenes that were refreshing and no rush about anything.Season 3 was an absolute joke and insult to the previous seasons but it can't take away from the genius first season
258,"And in the freefall of disappointment, you start realising what in the world went wrong with season 3, more like why in the world? No more suspense, no more thrill, no more grip, no more strange. At best, it was disappointing. Season 3 was very basic and mediocre moster hunting series. Though you will watch because you have watched season 1 and 2, and because we hope to get a better season 4. They have to do a lot in next season to make up for the loss in season 3."
259,"Now! I watched Stranger Things a few years ago and quickly understood why everyone fell in love with it. It's different.Season 1 was absolutely amazing! I'm not sure there was a thing I would change.Season 2 definitely took it up a notch higher. My favourite and the best by far thing was Noah Schnapp's (Will) performance. He knocked the ball out of the court. I'm still a bit sad he didn't get the recognition he deserved for that season. One thing that didn't sit right with me was the episode with Eleven and her supernatural 'friend'. It felt as if they were trying to force a wrong key into a lock. It just didn't belong.NOW, season 3 on the other hand was something else. I loved the cinematography, the music. It seemed fresh. But, the deeper into it I got, the more bored. It's as if they were trying to flatter the audience with the little unnecessary scenes instead of sticking to the originality and the taste the audience fell in love with. I barely remember half of what happened in season 3. They levelled up in every single thing but what truly mattered, the storyline."
260,"Season 1: Excellent writing and direction; the characters are easy to root for, the story is clever enough to work, and the pop culture references are... Well, I wasn't always a huge fan of them, but they're pleasant enough. Overall, an amazing season of television. 10/10
Season 2: Umm... The acting, direction and the characters are as great as ever. The story, not so much. It felt like the writers were just milking the nostalgia cow a little. 8/10
Season 3: Wtf? The tone of this show is drastically changed, the 80s references are practically fighting to get into your eyeballs, the writing is lazy and self-seeking, and the ending does all the emotional heavy lifting which in any other season would have been evenly spread out throughout the season. 6/10
Please, Stranger Things, you're better than this."
261,"The Dumber Brothers spent all their creative talents on Season 1, and used that success to glide through a weaker but passable Season 2. Season 3 was just bad TV. Nasty Russians operating under a shopping mall, character subplots that are so badly cliche, and just plain bad writing and directing. Lazy.The magic is gone and we're left with a loud, b-grade PG-13 ""horror"" that isn't fooling anyone. You had your fun Duffers, time to put this thing back on the shelf."
262,"Season 1 was perfect. Season 2 was still enjoyable. Season 3 is annoying with drawn out shouting dialogue and cliches. Is it because they are all teenagers? Not so, because even the adults are getting typecast and annoying. Two big problems I see with season 3: 1) drawn-out storyline that should have been over before it began (yes we know the monster and it is scary), 2) too many new cast members. The whole charm of the concept to me was the beauty of the friendship of these group of four outcasts. But as the seasons evolved, they became way cooler and pretty much all had girlfriends...may be that is wishful thinking on the part of the creators, but I dont remember nerds with gf or bfs, because I certainly was one. To me I just no longer connect with most of the characters anymore. I hope this is the last season or they need to change big time."
263,"Stranger Things is cool, but ultimately disappointing. Though I love 80's horror and sci-fi as much as the next weirdo, I feel like if you're going to invoke such a loud stylistic lexicon you need to bring something new to the table, something of your own to balance the appropriation and allusion. The first episode is intense, dense with promises of captivating plots to be revealed. All the 80's elements are there, and handled so well, I am giddy with anticipation—where will this show take me? The 80's horror vibe is so well captured I feel it can't be all there is; a show so fluent in this language must surely do something interesting with it. The rules and conventions of the genre are established in such a way as to convince me they will be played with or broken. Alas. This show is as by the book as they come. As the narrative unfolds, the horror I feel most is, first, a suspicion, which slowly blooms into realization—the 80's mashup pastiche angle is sort of all there is. Some of the characters are engaging, and there is some fine acting, sure, particularly from the young Millie Bobbie Brown, as well as David Harbour, and, at times, Winona Ryder, but it is not enough to save the greater whole; this show does not transcend the shadow cast by its titanic genealogy. In addition to heavy Stephen King, Steven Spielberg, and John Carpenter influences, other appropriated/allusive elements which deserve mention include: some watered-down Akira as the basis for Eleven's character/premise/backstory; an errant MK ULTRA namedrop; a sensory deprivation tank a la Altered States; shots (of Eleven in the ""upside down"") which look remarkably similar to some of those found in 2013's Under the Skin; a figure coming out of a wall as in the Frighteners... the list could probably go on.Some of these ideas and elements might have worked if they weren't so flagrantly underdeveloped. I was ready to like this show. I wanted to like it. I even tried to convince myself I liked it. People seem to enjoy it for the 80's throwbacks; I feel there is nothing else to it. Stranger Things invokes the style of the classics as if to count itself among them, but it plainly is not. I find it utterly forgettable. If you are interested in contemporary work made using this vocabulary, and want something which does more than rearrange existing pieces, I would recommend It Follows, a movie every bit as good as the classics of the genre it draws from."
264,"Season 3 most blatant/silliest of all. Goonies + Evil Dead + Invasion of Body Snatchers + The thing + Half Life + James Bond / Russians + Terminator dude. A goofy mishmash of genres and 70s/80s/90s movie references targeting both kids and their parents. It's 80s nostalgia on steroids injected also with current me2 female affirmative action agenda. Men are either villains or geeky boys playing second fiddle to superpower super-assertive super-smart fearless chicks. Except for these gender role ""upgrades"" there is nothing here that hasn't been seen in the past decades.I guess if you are too young to have seen the originals you may like this show. I don't. BTW guys, check out the new Evil Dead series. It's similar genre but 10,000 times better."
265,The first 2 seasons are really good but the third one is really disappointing
266,"First of all, we love S1 and S2, have watched them a number of times. Looking forward to S3 we binged it yesterday. I have to say, it lost that character development, over all relationships feel from the 1st two seasons. There's not enough focus on the dark aspect of the Upside Down, not answering some questions about it from the 1st two seasons, and disjointed overall. Started off good, Dacre Montgomery was excellent, and the season should've centered on that scenario more than Cold War espionage in a mall, which became annoying at times. Some scenes became boring, some too silly, esp the end taking away what was a very emotional climax. and they didn't have to say GD almost every scene to show the kids were older, too obvious, like why. The Shadow and Billy's being host became almost a side note towards the end, until the end. It all just fell flat, and left us feeling more sad and disappointed with no closure to anything. I'm a fan of the show, but not going to give S3 a pass, because I hope S4 does better."
267,"All of it is the same generic cliche crap every single time, I haven't watched a movie in 5 months this year and I haven't watched a new show in idk how long cause season 3 is a perfect explanation of what's wrong with tv/movies and I'm glad everyone else agrees that season 3 is horrible."
268,"There was so much that was just right about the first season: a Lovecraftian narrative, good story, interesting characters, solid pacing and a charming homage to the 80s.Most of that went south on season 2: a derivative plot, disjointed storylines, poor character development and just all-around mediocre writing. Ultimately, season 2 turns out to be a boring affair with little to none of the charm found in spades in season 1.And don't even get me started on season 3."
269,"Season one was good , season ending was very bad and 3 is worst!!!!!A giant monster can kill by a little kid.In season 2 that creater was distracted by some chocolates what a joke"
270,"Title says it all, season 3 has no story and it felt like they just made it up as it went along. I will not be watching season 4"
271,Childish which is ok if it's done probably but it wasn't i hate how instead of focusing on the show they try to brainwashed teenagers
272,"Not happy with season 3, its lost its darkness and it's way too sloppy and teen love story."
273,"I'm not gonna write a long review because I don't want to repeat what many others have said. Stranger Things is a good show- it's very well directed and acted, it has a pretty interesting mystery, and some of the first episodes are pretty creepy- but it is nowhere near the level of quality many people say it is. I liked the amount of suspense and horror in the first few episodes, but as the show went on it became more about the uninspired characters and less about the mystery, sci fi and horror, and when we finally saw the Demagorgen it looked really cheap. I've watched all of the episodes, and the only episodes that impressed me were the second one, which had a great first half but dropped the ball a bit in the last 30 minutes, and Holly Jolly. I think (like some people have already said), the super-high rating this show has on IMDb might just be because so many people are nostalgic about the 80's and not because Stranger Things is actually one of the best shows ever. Stranger Things isn't a bad show, but it's nowhere near as good as people say it is."
274,Puts me in a 80s euphoric place with the script. Can't get enough!
275,"This is actually my first review on IMBD, although I am a member for more than 15 or 20 years. I decided to write one, after seeing all the positive remarks on season 3, feeling quite the opposite myself.
I really liked season 1 of ""Stranger Things"", one of the best shows I have ever watched. Season 2 was so-so for me, already seeing where things were going - protracting and adding almost nothing new to the previous one, it was worse.
But season 3 is really really bad. It is laughable, unrelatable, full of nonsense. It has almost nothing to do with the atmosphere of the show from season 1 (and to some extend season 2). It is different in every way, and not in a good way. After the first two episodes I was already questioning myself whether or not to finish watching it till the end. The next episodes I watched with one eye looking at other things on my phone, skipping entire scenes of ""important"" dialogue. I actually did not watch the very end of the last episode, I just stopped it.
Why did we like ""Stranger Things"" in the first place? Maybe because of the dark atmosphere, the story about the secret experiments and telekinesis, the monster and the upside-down. This is what I believe most people liked. If there was a good writing, I think next seasons should've explained more and more about these things: what is the nature of the monster, why did it appear, what did it want, what was the upside-down all about?
What do we have in Season 3 instead? New corny light atmosphere, some kind of a new monster created out of thin air, unexplained actions and decisions by some people somewhere, new characters appearing with the snap of your finger, just because..., and no answers whatsoever to the important questions of the original story that got us hooked.
The two most annoying things here were the shift from the original story to the one about the life of the kids, and the inclusion of the mighty bad Russians.
Regarding the first one, the show simply changed its story (I guess either because the creators/Netflix were out of ideas, or they wanted to prolong, of course, their ""product"" for as many seasons as possible). Now we were introduced to hours and hours of show about ""a day in the life of ...put a name here..."". I get it, the kids grow up, become teenagers, they start to develop feelings for each other, blah blah blah...But this was not what Stranger Things was about in the first place! And even there, there was no story development at all. Instead, we shifted scenes from one couple, to the next one, then to the next one, and then back again. They say couple of sentences to each other, and we move on. Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat...
The second annoying thing was maybe the most laughable and unbelievable of them all - the introduction of the big bad Russians. They just simply appeared out of nowhere, knowing almost all about the experiments, the door to the other world, maybe the monster (how, what did they want, why were they doing it, these are stupid questions nobody cares about, right?). They had unlimited resources, operated without notice on American soil (WTF, HAHAHAHAHA), had amazing technology and machines (??). And then the Russian ""Schwarzenegger"" guy? Oh, my lord, that was absolutely ridiculous, and absolutely unrealistic. The scene where he walks around hundreds of people celebrating 4th of July with dark military clothes and holding gun in his hand (!!!) just like that, then he shoots a guy dead, but guess what, people around him do not notice, they have balloons and candy and smiles on their faces. Utter nonsense! Or when the ""conspiracy"" US guy was able to fool one Russian guard with his bad Russian accent????? What a joke!
At that point I honestly thought Stanger Things moved to the genre of parody. The whole Russian thing reminded me very much of the ridiculously unrealistic old James Bond movies from the 70s-80s. You always had some villain with a base on the moon/island/snow/underground, with unlimited resources, hundreds of people operating under his command, pushing buttons in some corridors in some rooms in some chairs. And our guys are just 3 or 4 against hundreds...
And by way, being Eastern European myself, the image and acting of all the Russians was unrealistic and bad, they don't act and sound and say things the way the show portrayed them, to be honest.
Anyway, to end this, watching Season 3 of this once great and very promising show was a complete waste of time and grey matter. I will not watch anything new that will come in the future about Stranger Things.
For me this show started and ended at season 1."
276,"I felt like I was watching MTV vids mixed with slasher comedy? Many great reviews written here. I agree with all. So sorry to see young talent go through bad writing, production, etc. Hope all come out with great future casting / acting. Why Wynonna?Why? Contractual?
Thanks for Chapters One and Two. Great theme music."
277,"People were saying how amazing this is and u have to see it. I watched it. It wasn't very good. Long straining episodes with not very good acting. Doesn't completely make much sense. A Netflix Original. The graphics are alright. The story is poor. The overall series is ok. I wouldn't say don't watch it, but don't rush into watching it. It was overhyped. I might have missed something but I think it's worth about a 6"
278,This is a very solid series with a promising premise. It really gets the style down well with a lot of 80s homages. The first season is the best as it has an intense build up and reveals its secrets slowly. The other seasons got a bit silly and repetitive. The characters and science fiction elements are both done very well.
279,"I rated each season differently. Season 1 (10 stars), season 2 (8 stars), and season 3 (6 stars). Season 1 is beyond amazing, the story and the mysteries perfectly to each other. There are many memorable moments and it is simple, fresh story, and also darker tone. I love mystery mixed supernatural story and it embark its mysteries in small town. Season 1 is a sensational. Then, we're going to season 2. I like to see the developing relationship between Eleven and Hopper. It's lovely. Season 2 give more plot holes than season 1, but it's still alright for me. Even, i still confuse with Eleven's sister and Eleven background story. I still dissatisfied to the her past stories. But, my favorite scene is when they're in the hospital. And the last season disappoint me. It lose its unique. The story become more light, and it's actually more suitable for young or the children. I don't feel the mysteries atmosphere again, it become the usual teenage drama with monsters. I hope in the fourth season, they uncover the mystery, like how could the down side appeared and what is the down side actually, and etc. Stranger Things should gain more focus to reveal its mystery, increasing the darker tone, and stop playing character's personality (like they do to Hopper's role)."
280,"Season 1&2 were truly great. Season 3 is really dumbed down to the level C class unfunny comedy. Characters are unrelatable, unlikable and really annoying. All that's left of unique atmosphere is shallow, hipstery fascination with esthetics of the 80-ies but without the substance. Don't get me wrong - story is still gripping but for me - magic is gone."
281,"The first season was great, it was original, well written & the actors were fantastic in their roles. Unfortunately after that the hype of the show & it's actors became more important than the show itself. The following seasons are just an exact rehash of the events of the first season with slight changes to make you think it's different. It's become boring & repetitive, I didn't even finish the latest season because it All felt very ""been there done that"""
282,"Season 3 The Wokeness Monster
Bad plot, disjointed storylines, unbelievable Russian involvement & the only monster in the move is the ""wokeness monster"".The boy can't get the girl, girl can't get the boy, the toughies have to be female, they men need saving, we have to inject a gay character (who is not believable as a lesbian) and of course our hero losses her powers... so original, so woke"
283,"In some ways, I should have ignored the 3rd season. It took a solid series and dragged it into cheesy C class pulp.The series starts in a good foot. Some decent characters who mostly capture the 80s (although not as well as in Ready Player One). The sets and costumes felt right. Winona Rider was one of the few poor performers in season 1. El was very well played.The second season shook things up and added more of an edge to the characters. However, modern politics started to creep in, starting with the episode about the sister. This was probably the beginning of the end of the series as it never really recovered.
There are some glaring ""modern"" issues in the series. All mothers were almost saints, fathers either stupid or violent. Dialogue deteriorated into preachiness (especially in the 3rd season). Any male character with initiative was either stupid or violent (and all of them were sidelined, leaving only ""emasculated"" male characters). Steve was especially sidelined. The authors clearly had very separate ideas about male and female characters that were maintained rigidly.
The other major sin was the 3rd season not only reduced characters to one dimension, it also tried to be funny when it clearly wasn't. It was like watching those budget kids movies full of preachiness and phony characters. Some of the dialogue was painful (eg. If you show concern for El, you're oppressing her).The first 13 episodes (roughly) are really well done. They largely captured the 80s (although Mohawk man and his merry twits were awful and very ""out of character"" - loosely like Punky Brewster but in adult form). The first half of season 2 also avoided preachiness and modern politics. it had a great balance of action and heart (probably like the Goonies). After that, the show's characters became arroganct, sassy, sexist, preachy and every other sin you can commit (especially the Russians are all villains joke that carried on WAY too long). Some of the newer characters like Maxine were painful.
This is a series with solid highs and many lows. They really need to quit while they're ahead."
284,Season 1 was a great combo of nostalgia and sci fi which ran its course perfectly in a nice little package. of course it was pushed into season 2 and 3 with no substance or direction. it hit the 'meh' level pretty quickly
285,"Season 3 has been a big disappointment for me. The scenes with bad, pointless dialogue seem to last forever, and much of the story is juvenile and ridiculous. I'd still recommend seasons 1 and 2 however, despite Winona Ryder's grating performances."
286,"'Stranger Things' was, for me, a series of 10 in its debut; an event. His second season was at least 8, for its intensity and show. This third one has remained in a 6.I have the feeling that season 3 is the least working; not forgetting that it's the least realistic and serious season."
287,"While I liked the two other seasons a lot, Season 3 is boring"
288,"E.T., Harry Potter, these are the stories that perfectly capture the essence of being kids on an epic adventure. With Stranger Things, there can now be a third story added to that short but illustrious list. You root for these kids, who are not the rude cookie-cutter kids so prevalent in movies today. They are smart and kind and I was with them every step of the way; and the adult cast was every bit as compelling. The story is suspenseful and even a little scary at times, but it is also laugh-out-loud funny. This charming series runs the gamut of emotions, delivering chills, heartbreaking moments, an incredible buddy story, adventure, terrific humor, and lots of twists and turns. These are eight episodes of perfection, as far as I am concerned, and I can't wait to see where this series goes! My only regret is that I watched them all and can never watch it, for the first time, again."
289,So patetic 3th season. Why politics in childrend fantasy series?? Why??? Russians feedin monsters with humans? Pity the fool
290,"1st season: the greatest. 2nd season: still great. 3rd season: full of unnecessary violence - achieving gore limits - and lots of (long) disgusting goo scenes. Most of the 80's magic was replaced by trash movie ideas. 0k, the 80's are full of trash culture but Stranger Things wasn't following this path... Till now..."
291,"Watched season one and liked it. Watched season two and it felt like pulling teeth out. Watched the trailer for season three... and I've lost all hope. The only good thing about this show is Steve, and we all know it. I liked him from the get go and that's that. Honestly wouldn't suggest watching past season one. The characters become cringe-y."
292,"Season 1 : 1/10
Season 2 : 1/10
Season 3 : 1/10A very well shot "" piece of crap "".This series by Netflix was highly recommended to me by my friends for some "" horror "" entertainment and Season 3 gave me sweet dreams.
This SHOW is overrated. There's useless talks ,' make no sense ' romance , boredom boredom and boredom. People are talking about their 80's times revisited , extraordinary performances by the child actors and together , they are nothing but marketing strategies. The Duffer Brothers live up to their names. Just the Netflix version of Ghostbusters. Not worth a single penny. Watch 'DARK' and 'PEAKY BLINDERS' if you think your Netflix subscription would go waste.That Eleven girl is so irritating.
Can't believe the ratings are so close to 'DARK'And IMDb asking for spoilers in my review for this Garbage show... like really? The whole show is itself a S-P-O-I-L-E-R."
293,Season 3 is the worst season ever. Even preschool kid make better than that. You really have no imagination . You have same that bloody old story. Russian trying to invade and your bunch of nuisance nerds crack them out. Seriously . You really need to grow up . Bloody wastage of time.
294,"Wow, this show is amazing. It contains a perfect balance of everything you would ask for in a show.I love the fact that it feels like I'm watching an 80s classic.Each and every episode contains the quality of a blockbuster movie, the camera work is steady and just like a Spielberg movie, and the music and actors tie together everything.My favorite character is the sheriff. The costume design and and set look great, and not for a moment it feels like I'm watching a show. Great job to the directors!I don't have a single complaint for this show."
295,"I grew up watching eighties' stuff like Goonies, Gremlins, E.T. and all of that stuff, and of course wonderful horror like Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street the Thing and Jaws, and this series struck that nerve like a jackhammer. From the bikes, to the Dungeons and Dragons, the hair and basically everything. This show is basically a love letter to the spielbergian action movies for kids, and unlike other similar attempts, like Turbo Kid, it's not a parody.Also: great acting (especially the kids), superb casting, wonderful set design and dramaturgy. Easy 10/10 for me on this one, and praying for a season two. Rarely have I been able to watch seven episodes without a single break. More stuff like this Netflix."
296,"The season 1 great , season 2 meh , season 3 Total s.h.i.t I stopped watching after episode 1 . It doesn't deserve 8.8"
297,"It's a cool show, but it's a kids show. Dark is way better"
298,Such a disappointment. The first 2 seasons were pretty fun to watch but the 3rd is a train wreck. The somewhat cute and dorky kids from the first couple seasons have grown up to be not very likable and for some reason foul mouthed. The romance between L and Mike that occupied most of the first three episodes was unbearable. I can see why the 12 and 13-year-old age range likes the show but if you're over 15 there's no reason to watch it. As usual with Hollywood they have stretched the storyline out too far and it's not even remotely interesting anymore. Hopefully this ends the series.
299,"Season one. Very fun 9 out of 10
Season two. Some fun with a bit of silliness 7 out of 10
Season three. ""We give up but we got paid so just randomly throw out some stuff with Russians"" 5 out of 10"
300,"When you run out of ideas, it's best to blame on Russians"
301,"NOTHING original and vastly overrated, just a collection of scenes and ideas from other movies with nothing to add to the genres, if it was rated accurately it would have a five out of ten"
302,"I like EVERYTHING about this show. Acting is great, character development, story, attention to details, pace. A mix of the best classics from Spielberg, King and Shyamalan. Being a kid of the 80s, I really enjoyed all the details, the score, the fonts, the obvious reference to classic films and music from that era. Creature CGI could have been better, but won't complain because the overall quality of this show is well over average.The only downside is that I've already went through all 8 episodes... It truly felt like an 8 hour movie, but I never got bored.Man I hope they make a second season."
303,This has to be the most overrated tv show there is. A rating of 8.8? The same as Peaky blinders? Absurd.
304,"First season - fantastic! Second season - great. Third season - well... there will be no third season. This thing was a new show and i hope there will be no more of it. I loved Stranger Things and i was excited about the new episodes but this was worse than GOT final season. Every part of the story and characters was illogical and ridiculous. The older the kids get the more childish the show becomes. All the Russians are either bad or dumb or in most cases both, why? And that wasn't even the worst part... Even the ones who wrote this thing was rolling their eyes. I'm expecting a new character soon - a really really strong and smart gay African american woman with hairy armpits and legs with a great job and salary and non offensive boyfriend. And she will play every other shows too"
305,"1. No progress in acting.
2. Same story in all seasons. Severe lack of creativity in story writing.
3. Good cinematography.
4. If you've watched Season 1, you've watched it all."
306,"I don't know how they managed to turn a scary, interesting show into a teen comedy. I sucks that they ruined one of my favorite shows."
307,"First of all, I loved season 1. Season 2 was weaker but still good enough to long for the third installment.In short it seems like Disney got a hand in the third season giving all the leads in season 3 to women destroying the basic story of a tight nerdy boys group on adventure. The nerdy boys turned to dumb casanovas a year later with almost everybody having a girlfriend except Will. Really? These guys were pretty smart in the first two seasons but the third season they turned into idiots, come on! Ok not every single one of them. Speaking of Will, the only contribution Will had in this season was feeling the back of his neck and saying something like he is here. None of the guys had a lead role in this season, Dustin came really close though. Not sure why the push of all the women in strong lead roles had to be incorporated in Stranger things. This story was about the boys and this basically turned to a long episode of the power puff girls. On top of that the mysterious tone set in the first two seasons was almost non-existent in the third season. The tone was more comical and the ending felt like the last episode of GOT. Wait what, was that it? UGH! Utterly disappointing and hard to correct in the next season. Thanks for another crap season of a favourite show (Black Mirror)"
308,"First off, I'm going to say that I did enjoy the show. The acting was good, the music was top notch, and the cinematography was great! So why did I give it a 7/10? Quite simply it's plot is simplistic, it isn't that scary or suspenseful when it claims to be and I found the majority of the characters bland. I only really cared about the cop, Jim Hopper and the kid, Dustin. Everyone else wasn't really given a second thought until they reappeared on screen. At some points I forgot the plot was about the main group of kids trying to find out what happened to their friend as it ping-ponged around between the characters so much, I actually got a headache, and this is coming from someone who understood the ending to BioShock: Infinite.When you break it down, the story is mainly driven by nostalgia, a lot of it will go over people's heads who weren't born in the 70s/early 80s. And when there were subplots, I felt like they were somewhat unnecessary and/or executed poorly. For example, Nancy's motivation. After her friend Barbara disappears, she starts her own investigation along with Jonathan Byers. This (predictably) ends with a form of romantic tension which actually doesn't lead anywhere as Nancy stays with her actual boyfriend Steve (Who's for lack of a better term: A nob) who (Also predictably) does a somewhat lackluster heroic twist during a final confrontation by assisting Nancy and Jonathan against the... monsterThis is another down-point for me, not only do they make the mistake (Mistake in my eyes, it can be done well) of revealing the monster in it's fullest. It's also a generic black Wendigo-ish design with a head that opens like a dog from Resident Evil. Set in a story where they try and make everything suspenseful, they just go ahead and show you the beast. The best form of horror is when the audience fabricates the monster themselves, let us hear it, see a sudden silhouette move in the background, let us see their destruction, but don't let us see THEM. All in all, you should give this a watch, it's a good summer binge. Easily done in one sitting. It's enjoyable, in some instances, fun. But it's simply over-hyped and overrated when it comes to it's praise. Like I said, it's main drive is nostalgia which doesn't sit well with me.This reason this review covered mainly negative aspects of the show is because, as it's a *Spoiler Review* I'm assuming you've already watched it and are therefore in other peoples opinions on the show. You've probably heard all the praise in the world for it, hence my recommendation of the show, but cover the negatives."
309,"It's GOT all over again with the latest season being a let down. Another epic show bites the dust
Where to begin with?
*All the characters start behaving so strangely (maybe thats why the name Stranger Things) opposite to their character development in past 2 seasons
* Unnecessary Comedy in dead serious situations.
* The whole Russian plot is so lame and stupid (except for alexi though loved him ).
* This season felt so artificial and unnatural. I mean you could dig first two seasons but this one was just ahhhh.... Didn't even feel like watching the season finale.
*Unnecessary lame sound tracks."
310,"A kids stories for kids, played by kids, and might have also been written and directed by kids.
There's some foul languages though, so this maybe (I guess) for kids over 12 years old.
I hate when a movie uses jumpscares which add nothing to story line is a strong indicator for bad writing/directing. It most always go together with temper tantrum, close calls, coincidences, stupid simple logic fails (no common-sense), etc. cliches you will get from B- grade movies.
Postive side, a bit over acting but overall actingwise are quite good."
311,"I don't think I can find anything wrong about this show besides the the cast themselves. For those reasons, I only give it a 4/10 because it got to hard to finish."
312,The should have renamed the show in season three to Boring Things
313,"Season 1= 9/10
Season 2= 7/10
Season 3= 1/10, Why? Because Dustin killed Hopper and the series. Yes, if he didn't do all that stupid singing Hop still be alive.
I really liked S01 and S02 but S03 is an insult to the viewers. If you take out the yelling, the unnecessary stupid dialog, and all the things that have nothing to do with the real story, the whole plot will fit in half hour.They turn a good series into one only good for children under 13
One thing I'm sure is that I'm not watching S04."
314,"Stranger Things in Season 1. A unique story with powerful background sound, a 10/10.
The nature of the story as such, it isn't wise to make further seasons beyond the first but they did. No wonder it shows in ratings.
My advice, must-watch S1. Beyond that watch at your own risk."
315,"Season 1: very good show, original and funny, I want to see more.
Season 2: ah ok, more of the same...
Season 3: even more of the same...Every season it is the same (maybe that is the point?). We start where everybody is happy and are not aware of any danger. So slowly everybody will see the signals and after a while they finally take it serious and everybody will work together and defeat the enemy. Well not really defeating, because it is always coming back...At some points when watching season 2 I was thinking: ok... More of the same... I am a bit bored sometimes, but it is still a good show. I kept on watching. But with season 3 I really thought: why is this happening? Why are they making this choices? Yes I know it should be like that, but it starting to become irritating. And also that weird 'love' thing and behaviour. So I cannot really complain about the choices they are making, because it should be cheesy, but still... Maybe it is not for me, the 80s.So I am finished with this show. So they go out of town, the Russians have another 'thing'. So season 4 will start all over again: they need to come together again, wait for the signals and finish it off again. It is a good show, after season 1 I would have given it 9 stars. Great acting, nice mystery, build up is nice, but after a while the enemy is getting boring, please find something new."
316,"I had heard such fantastic things about this tv show but I was unfortunately disappointed. Is it a bad show? No. Is it good? Yes, it is. But it's really nothing more than that. The acting is alright and it has a decent story with some funny moments. It wasn't really scary or particularly creepy however it did have some thrilling moments like when Will first appears in the upside down. Overall I think it is a fun, enjoyable tv show with some laughs and thrills but i don't think it's anything amazing ."
317,It was recommended to me by a friend of my ex. It did nothing for me. I found it semi boring. It turned out my then boyfriend felt the exact same way.
318,"Until watching the third season, this show was among my favorite TV series. I have really enjoyed the first two seasons because of its dark atmosphere and the great acting that has performed by the cast which led me to rating it a perfect 10. However, my opinion has changed a lot after seeing the third season. The unnecessary obsession for the Russians in the series has changed the atmosphere a lot from a could-be all time favorite to a cliche. Another point is that, because of the transformation of dark atmosphere to a more childish one, the series have lost its attractiveness for me. Not sure if I will ever watch the next season and I don't get the people that have rated the episodes for the third season above 8."
319,This show started off with such a unique blend of 80 style and mysterious plots. Now I don't feel that same sensation I felt at the end of every episode that I once did. I'll still watch next season but I'm not gonna expect anything like the quality of season 1.
320,"The first season of Stranger Things was pure gold. Being born in the early 80's this show was obviously nostalgic gold for me and the mystery part was intense and well planned. You could really feel the constant danger lurking in the air in season 1.By season 3 it has become a romance comedy show with a nostalgia overtone. The monsters are much like zombies in late seasons of a zombie show: no longer as dangerous and easily forgettable by the cast. As soon as there are no monsters present in season 3 no one is scared and there is no suspense. The kids just gather ""cool stuff"" and joke about how they will beat the monsters. They just laugh it off. The same goes for solving puzzles (it takes no time for them to solve the Russian ""threat"" in season 3 - no suspense what so ever).Then of course we get the ""diversity checkboxes"", that are so prevalent today, in season 3 of Stranger Things. Forced and unnecessary.It went from a 10 show to a 5 show for me. Too bad."
321,"Season 3 was very similar to the previous two seasons, with a few new characters and bigger, better monsters. There were some very corny scenes, but overall, the ending was a satisfying one that will hopefully close out the series for a good while."
322,"Season 1 - TOP
Season 2 - Not bad
Season 3 - Netflix? It's okay, but not as good as I expected!"
323,"Season one was scary. Season two was a rehash but still good. Season three was fun, lots more 80s references, great music BUT the Hollywood stuff was forced and out of place. Two of the small group of kids come out, why? I guess one of the writers wanted to make a point? It threw the whole season off for us. Also, I get that the uniforms were for the viewer not to be confused but our of place and silly. Lastly, Billy turns into a demon was a weird twist. Good ending. I think we can put a fork in it though. I'll buy the music."
324,Really loved this show but the show has run its course. Season 3 is filled goofy comedy that is meant for 8 year olds. It also really goes too far to push gender ideology...men bad weak and stupid-women intelligent strong and good. I didn't even finish the last two episodes it was so bad. It was the last show that I kept Netflix for. Time to cancel :)
325,This is some of the best TV I've seen for quite some time. I would say it's more like a Steven King story rather then a Steven Spielberg movie. It's a great mix of the paranormal and sci-fi and as a fan of this kind of genre I had an idea by halfway through the series what was going on. Many of the principal characters are kids but kids stuff it certainly is not. All of the young cast are good but I think Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven really steals the show like Ellie Fanning in Super 8. I'd have to say that the sinister government agency responsible for all distress brought to the Hawkins community were rather sloppy and in reality they would have found the girl (Eleven) a lot sooner. I have a feeling we have not seen the last of her. We know that Sheriff Hooper made some kind of deal with the government agents but it's not clear at this point exactly what it was. It does have a satisfactory ending but with enough loose ends for a further season. Hopefully there is enough interest in this show for a DVD release at some point. Most of the reviews (mine included) have been generally favorable and I do hope that it will have enough of an audience worldwide to give the go ahead for a series two and I also hope that we don't have to wait an entire year for it but more then likely we will.
326,"I only manage to finish this series by ""purge watching."" It's my own term. It's the opposite of ""binge watching"" where you're apparently so enraptured by a show you can't stop watching. ""Purge watching"" is when you can't wait for a series to be over, so you use the fast forward button during the throw-away, series-padding scenes. And there's a lot of padding in the show. Like a cheap Stephen King Santa. Honestly, are we supposed to really accept this asa ""homage"" or is it just the ultimate recycling job? A number of critics thought 8 hours devoted to the somewhat thin story of ""Stranger Things"" was excessive. I was thinking about the story in my head, and if it hadn't been given the soap opera drag out treatment, condensed down to a 2-hour movie it would have been even worse -- exposing more clearly the basic silliness and retread plot. The watered-down tempo helped what otherwise would have been Cream of Condensed Tripe. You could claim running the same old numbers is in the name of ""homage"" or you could argue there's really not a lot of new ideas in the show. From the first scene where the scientists get pulled upward into the elevator, dangled by an unseen beast, I went ""ho hum."" Like I haven't see that visual in a million monster films. An old clever show like the X-Files would have had a pair of eyes creepily material in the wall of an elevator and then maybe the doors close and a scream. That show as extremely creative at coming up with original ideas and images -- which is why it was a great show. But immediately I wasn't that impressed with the ""Duffer Brothers"" mise en scene. I need more ""things I've never seen before"" from Sci-fi. And little touches like the elevator scene are where true originals and moderate talents separate themselves. I nearly bailed completely on the series. Episode 3&4 were sluggishly directed by Shawn Levy, who is pretty much an incompetent as a stylist. By episode 4, it has completely lost the ""vintage feel"" and leaning on the influences of contemporary cable: Let's play a moving piece of rock music over amontage of the different actors staring thoughtfully into space. The music swells... It's the HBO Method of audience intercourse. A directorial cliché. Sorry, but this doesn't have the ""feel"" of a 70s or 80s production at all, maybe a bit in the opening episode or two, but it pretty much is quickly replaced by a run-of-the-mill cable show feel. Vintage Spielberg always had a very kinetic feel. 70s and early 80s films were riffing off the vibe of Altman, Pennebaker, Penn, but sanitizing them a bit and joking them up. The vibe of this series is probably closest in spirit to the lousy cheapie Steven King films, and not in a good way. It's a leaden feel. I'm still skeptical of the ""tribue"" aspect of this show The Winonna""Poltergiest"" ripoff/tribute is the worst bit so far. Where's the dwarf psychic? As I also noted they managed to pay ""homage"" to ""Under the Skin"" and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" Were those nostalgic ""homages?"" If your pose a show as a tribute (and make sure to let people know up front to cover your tracks) does that eradication the icky ""borrowing."" I think a couple of producers (the Duffers you would assume) sat down and said: ""Yeah, I like the kid with powers from FireStarter, let's use that. And the kids from ""It"". The whole kid thing from King. ""Alien"" was a great movie. How about goo? And we'll stay away from the afterlife and just make it a portal to another dimension...."" Add Shaw Levy's teleplay staging (someone should let him know the camera moves) and it's all a bit snoozy. By the way, I also notice that the Duffer Brothers didn't write the series. They farmed out the episodes to a bunch of writer. Right there, their auteur status goes down the drain, IMO. Interestingly, I noticed that the Duffer Brothers wrote the teleplay for Episode 8, but another writer suddenly turns up with a ""story by"" credit (for the first time in the series) for that episode. That tell's me the Duffers' couldn't even figure out how to put a cap on their own series and brought in someone else to make sense of it. And the ending is all pretty perfunctory and predictable. They even managed to reproduce Steven King's most reliable device ... not being able to produce a really satisfying ending. So anyway, that's that. I'd give it a""C."" And warn Steven King to keep his paper covered during the next test."
327,It was nice to watch first season but third season seems like creators are out of ideas and repeating the same plot and can't came out with a new story.
328,"This is an example of Netflix manipulating the right age group as the right time. It's all nostalgic and fun for the parents of the current generation which will get their kids to get into it too and think the 80s were so innocent and cool. That being said, so what? It IS fun, that is until they found out how much people liked it then hurried to make another season of something that was suppose to be one season. Then it got all PC, they just had to throw another girl in the cast where she wasn't needed, then of course she had to have a thing for the only black kid, and so on and so on! That's PC culture ruining yet another show and greed ruining yet another storyline."
329,"I have been watching a lot of series but this one is a total kids bed time storey, totally mindless people throughout the series, you cant make a difference if it is a love storey or a thriller at any point in time."
330,"One of my favorite shows, but season 3 was really disappointing they copied movie I have watched long time ""Faculty"" and another movie for nicole kidman's movie ""the invasion"" where a big alien in human form came to school and starts putting his seed inside faculty members one by one till they get the students. also they suffer from dehydration so they consume a lot of water and staying cold!
Is that familiar?
Come on be more creative I can't even rate it"
331,It's very cliche series after season 1. S2 still bearable but s3 is just awful. Now I don't wanto see another season. Netflix please learn something from HBO & SHOWTIME.
332,"The show is going downhill and it's the same story about the upside down,gate and not killing any major character. Max you are so annoying and I can't take a single minute of you. The other characters are still okay but I despise you so much."
333,"I gave a 10/10 after season 1, the show was awesome.
After season 2, I changed it to 9/10 just because of that weird episode 7 full of stupidity.
Now, after watching season 3, I changed to 7/10, just out of respect for the previous seasons. I mean, what's the point they want to make? Brainwashing? I don't know. I believe the actor that's plays Hop got really tired of everything and demanded his character to be killed so he could get out of there. It's so disappointing the way they turned this show into a political agenda and promotion of feminism and lgbtwhateverz. They had everything, since meetings of men making fun of Nancy, then Nancy becomes bossy and treat Jonathan like a puppy, max promotes hate men talk, the little black girl promotes bullying and cursing, random diversity everywhere, Robin becomes a gay heroine although they made it in a brainwashing way, Mike and Jonathan acting like beta males, poor will is useless and also gay, and hopper becomes the incredibles dad, strong and dumb. I don't know what to say about the Russians and also about all the commercials, specially the coke one. It's just stupidity at its highest level. Hollywood, Disney, Netflix... They're all messing everything in the entertainment business."
334,"First time I logged in to write a review...but I HAD to. What an outstanding series....I hope there is more to come though I don't know if one could hit the mark like this again. As another said, a perfect blend of all that was great about movies from the 1980's. So if you are into that, this is going to be a series that you don't want to end. I always tend to re-watch movies from the 80's for the fantastic story telling that isn't in modern day cinema. Love, love, LOVE this! I keep saying out loud, ""Gahd who wrote this stuff...this is great."" I find it hard not to proceed on to the next episode, and at the same time don;t want to watch them too fast so that it is over."
335,"The first two seasons, Season 1 and Season 2, where a targeted joy of entertainment themed on the creators ideal storytelling, which is without doubt, 'STRANGER THINGS'. The audience were unfamiliar with ST's storyline and non-linear script that led to quests of enigma throughout the iconic 80's pop-rock cinematography and place of time, which made the series have a undoubted sentimental features, we have been so used to watching iconic films which have been inspired by the series, such as ET, Jurassic Park, GhostBusters trilogies, and much more horror-epitome 80's gore, that has been highly influenced by the writer's (DUFFER BROTHERS) style and vision they had for the seasons 1-2 that audiences seemed to connect with sentimental value.However, this season doesn't have any of the sparks and dilated pupils of horror, joy and raced-heartbeat that we experienced from the first 2. The storyline wasn't strange, and the things were not strange, all the audience had witnessed the same cycle of a weird epidemic of a sci-fi influencer, influenced by the SOU/Hawkins Lab, just do yourself a favour, don't watch it, but if you must do. I like to be optimistic about what I view, and greet a tragedy of poor quality for this season, it seemed sloppy and raced, and why did they have to rush-hour the season? I wouldn't of minded to wait another few months of better quality work, Netflix is probably to blame, for it's lack of sponsorship in making season cycles quality work."
336,"Where do I begin? This show may only be 8 episodes long but I have never seen such a diverse cast - where not one person fails to impress, each character has star turns and gets a chance to shine - something than many other shows lack. Eleven (Millie Brown) is an absolute stand out in this sci-fi show, and it is fantastic how much you take the journey with her throughout this. No matter of your age, she is the constant stand out in each scene. The direction and editing in this show has been put to amazing use and its as if you are a part of this journey with the characters yourself, it's like you are reading a book and going through each chapter, constantly wanting to read the next. The writing on this show is perfect and when it really hits the high - it stays there, we as a viewer are taken on an emotional roller coaster from start to finish. You believe every scene is as important as the last one and it's good to play close attention to the amount of detail that has been put in to each and every shot, cinematography is beautiful and you can see that the background is used to its full impact. There is this constant reminder of being a child and learning about friendship and love throughout life to when we grow through our teenage years to an adult & parent. All of this along with the fantastic 80's vibe and stand out Soundtrack throughout makes this for an even better watch and works fantastically well. If you were to mix Stephen Spielberg with Stephen King and John Carpenter you have basically got Stranger Things! This isn't just the stand out show of 2016 it's one of the biggest stand out shows ever made in the last 15-20 years and Stranger Things will be talked about for years to come, it is relevant now and will be for many years to come! I for one am already excited for watching this a 2nd time around."
337,Why do we feel the need to inject social justice nonsense in to everything? Because we want to destroy everything and start over with the cave age. That is the only reasonable explanation.
338,"Cheesy
Boring
Childish
Horrible
DisasterSeason 1 was something
Season 2 was half a something
Season 3 is nothingI literally had to fast forward to get done with the episodes ... waste of time."
339,"So what we have1) fat cop chief who is acting like a criminal . looks like a thug or hobo and have never seen any police training and yeah is living in a trailer
2) bunch of stupid kids who act stupid and look stupid and make stupid decisions
3) problem is that the kids are now too old and stupid funy actions only work with young kids but not with teenager where its just dump
4) stupid russians who cant even handle stupid helpless kids
5) stupid alien who by design never hurt any main characterI need to admit that everybody who is able to watch all 8h of this season 3 crap is kinda braindead or should seek medical helpbasically everybody on screen is aciting and looking stupid and dumb"
340,"The first season was just incredible! The friendship, the family relationship, the conspiracy, the suspense, uhhh ground-breaking!I would have rated it 10/10 if only season 2 and 3 are not what they are. To be fair, season 2 is quite good, just a few side stories that I don't quite care for. Season 3? Disappointing. Just bucketful of cringe, saved a bit by the finale.Conclusion, just watch season 1."
341,"This show was captivating when it first came out. A 9.5 outta 10... right up there with GOT, Breaking Bad and Dro. Who... It could have had a cult following FOR SURE. My boyfriend and I had binged through the first season antisipating every episode and captivated by the mystery and the acting. Season two was enjoyable, but it had lost it's thunder. Never the less, we really enjoyed watching the seson.Season three.... *sigh* There is nothing about season thress that I enjoyed if I'm honest. The children looked like they were crammed into toddlers clothing (despite having bicepts) and their amazing acting somehow regressed (I'm gunna blame it on the writting) The story line was unorigional (Hello body snatchers) and the need for those damn heart to hearts in every episode was straight up boring! I dreaed each episode and only commited in hopes it would wrap up with an amazing Stranger Things ending.To those who haven't seen this show yet.... watch season one... if you can't help but push through, watch season two, but spare youself the dispaointment of season three... and I say that as an individual who commits to everything I start watching, even if its 7 or 14 seasons in! Don't waste your time!"
342,"Series one was a masterpiece, fantastic TV. I know so many people who were completely enthralled by it, binged watched it in days.Series two was decent. Deeply flawed but whatever, it was watchable.Now, I really hope the creators read this, they almost certainly won't but hey, whatever. How in the world does something so good turn so bad in three seasons? It's terrible, unwatchable, an insult. School kids could have done it better. Really! It's so deeply flawed. The characters have become charicatures of themselves. The kids' acting was never great - other than the guy who plays Will - but you get past that. Until the third season. Because everything is so bad. It's an absolute cringe-fest from start to finish.
So much so that I felt compelled to finally create an IMDB account and write this. That's how insulted I was/am.Now, I promise to go over a few other shows I've watched and write positive reviews too, because they deserve it. And I don't like to use review services like this just to complain. But in this case I think it's worthwhile, even if one person reads it and decided to leave it at series two (or one)."
343,Was not a fan at all tried to watch it but just was not my cup of tea at all. If your a follower then you might like it. I'm not watching shows for nostalgia about my childhood .
344,"When show atarted it gave a suspense feel showing that loop holes would be explained later.
Some were explained some not .but still it was pretty good to watch. 2nd season slightly low but was convincing with good direction. The thing that ruined was 3rd season . Although show is not fully based on logics but 3rd season was logic disaster . If u realy have a good sence of shows u would give decent modest rating."
345,"It's OK. Probably better than season 2. The plot involves the Russians building a secret base deep underground, below the mall, and a terminator look-alike villain. Sound silly? It is. The other story arch involves the monsters from past seasons possessing people, think ""invasion of the body snatchers"". Very predictable. Although the 80s nostalgia is fun, I found myself bored before the end of each episode. It's also disappointing Robin turns out to be a lesbian. Her and Steve make a great couple. Strange how one minute, Robin is gushing about how much she liked him in high school despite him never noticing her...then not long afterward, while in a public restroom covered in blood and vomit, she decides to come out of the closet. Hmm...seemed unnecessary like the writers needed to check a diversity checkbox. And all the Russian hysteria reminded me a little bit too much of the Russian hysteria within a certain political party. The concept was stale, unlike season 1. Final verdict: Fun nostalgia. Pacing is a bit slow. Plot is silly. Overrated. Still manages to be enjoyable."
346,"The overall 6 is for all three seasons. Season 1, 10/10, Season 2, 8/10, and Season 3, 3/10.Clunkers for Season 3:1. Zero chemistry between Hopper and Joyce. They don't even seem compatible size-wise... Joyce is skinny and Hopper is overweight and tall. Plus, that infantile bickering... even the first argument they had (before I knew there would be many more I was thinking, uh, oh. Mature--not! They seemed more juvenile than the kids when the kids argued! And why pair together Joyce and Harper? No need, doesn't advance the plot. And that bearded guy calling out their love in graphic detail was just.... creepy. At that moment, I just disliked the bearded guy.2. Joyce in that ridiculous Russian outfit. She sure looked out of place, and the bad guys waved her in? I think she was the only woman in uniform too, whch should have raised several red flags.3. That horrible ambush of that lady lifeguard and then her turning onto her loving parents... how painful to watch. Also when Billy brought her in all tied up... I was expecting more of an outraged outcry from the public! None of the three deserved their fates. A lovely family dinner now fraught with suspicion on screen... that is so wrong!4. Yeah, monsters need to be scary. But the Mind Flayer, while scary, was also too gross and this detail was shown A LOT of on-screen time. I like to be able to watch without my stomach churning.5. Couldn't believe all these people disappeared and the monster practically boasted its public presence and NO ONE noticed? Don't people talk to each other in this town?6. Hopper and the boring Russian stalk each other inside the obstacle course at the July 4 Fair and NO ONE is inside there for about ten minutes? Thankfully no children but there were tons of people at every event at the fair, crowded and bustling. Too convenient.7. Hopper suddenly becoming a skilled tactical attack officer... enuf said. He's the chief of police in the town, he doesn't do this type of fighter chops during his day to day job. In fact Season 1 showed him sitting and smoking a lot at his office and at his run-down home. Can't a chief of police's salary afford him a more decent home?8. El and Mike smooching all the time at the start. I may be older than that generation but I don't think this type of lust is realistic among that age group. More likely they would talk and act out silly or unfortunately, move on beyond just necking, which is why they typically wait a bit longer. It would have been nicer for them to act like goofy lovers, which means chasing each other outside and between rooms, playing silly games, preparing snacks in the kitchen... that would have made me believe more.9. Fireworks disturbed the Mind Flayer... really? Fireworks don't explode like bombs, they just shoot projectiles. And they're no where as powerful as bombs. And there was no control over the trajectories of the fireworks, they could have just as easily shot off from the Mind Flayer's surface toward the air, not harming it one bit. That was so silly. It would have been better if somehow the gang found real bombs (maybe from the evil Russians' supply room) and the bombs really exploded some of the Mind Flayer.10. WHY WAS THERE A SUBPLOT ABOUT FERTILIZER? This was never explained. It was very shaky motive for Nancy to start investigating when she did. She just got lucky it ended up to be a key investigation.11. WHY ARE THE RUSSIANS OPENING THE GATE? The Mind Flayer could conquer Russia, too, after nicely disposing of America (not that anyone would wish it!). Nice going, smart.12. Too much action and bickering, I loved the Christmas lights mystery of Season 1 and how Barb disappeared and how Jonathan developed the revealing photos that led to the monster. Very subtle, very intriguing. In contrast the investigation of the lab below the mall was like 100% luck. Like a 12-year-old could figure all this out. No need to report to work, Hopper."
347,"I watched the whole series with great disappointment. The acting was bad, the script very amateur, the sound/noise very irritating, the cinematography horrible, the story weak and confusing, and the whole thing just a mess. I kept watching all eight episodes thinking that based on all the rave reviews surely there was something I was missing here. I think this might be among the worst TV series I have ever watched. I had heard the Duffer brothers interviewed on NPR's ""All Things Considered"" and I was drawn in thinking this was going to be great. I need to exorcise this somehow from my weekend. It was a waste of time and looking back painful to watch. I realize people have different tastes and clearly many people love this series but I honestly have to differ and can not recommend it at all, even on a very boring day with nothing else to do."
348,"I would describe this show as a Mystery, Action, Thriller set in the 80's. The Showrunners are definitely fans of 80's Kid Hero and Teen Romance Genres. They hired some of the most famous actors and actress from the 80's like Wynona Ryder, Sean Astin, Mathew Modine and Paul Raiser. Otherwise, there was no reason why the series was set in the 80's. However, the Showrunners failed to recreate the reasons why we love those movie characters. All the characters in this series are cliches and stereotypes. There were many attempts at humor but you can always see them coming a mile away, so they are never funny. There is nothing to like in any of the characters, so I didn't care if they live or die. The only reason to watch the series is waiting for the mystery reveal and the action is top notch. Otherwise, it is boring while waiting for the mystery reveal and actions. If you like a good mystery and good action then you may like it. If you are expecting good story telling and likable characters then you should skip."
349,"There's just one thing that really impressed me about this series and that is the high IMDb rating given to this heap of garbage. I say this because I find it utterly amazing that the reviewers who rated this steaming pile of excrement with 9's and 10's must surely ALL be under 12 years of age, and yet they have somehow managed to write reviews that, for the most part, are well worded, grammatically correct and with very few spelling errors. So - well done, kids!! For anyone over 12 years of age - please, just stay right away from this stinker.(PS: Would it have hurt to have given poor ""11"" a Kleenex tissue or two?)"
350,I did not like season 3 at all. A little to cheesy for me.
351,This show will hook you as soon as you watch it.This show is so amazing and anyone from ages 12 to 100 should watch it.There is death but also comedy.You will laugh and cry and everything.The characters are amazing and amazing actors.WATCH IT!!!!!!!!!
352,"I was full of hope when I watched the pilot for this highly rated and very popular series. After the pilot I was bewildered as to why the vast number of viewers have given this wishy-washy show such outrageously high ratings! There is nothing new being done here and the quality is mediocre, IMHO!But I decided to watch another episode, just in case the material got better. I, however, gave up towards the end of it. I found it so boring and basically just annoying. This series hardly deserves even one star; it's dreadful!I found the acting to be mostly mediocre, as well as the material. Winona Ryder is overplaying her role with too much hysteria. Other actors are just so so..."
353,"Alright Netflix, you really have to cool it with these original series. I mean, for the most part they've been exceptionalI've enjoyed most of Orange is the New Black, laughed out loud at Lady Dynamite and had my love of super hero fiction rejuvenated thanks to Daredevil and Jessica Jones, but I haven't fallen so heavily in love with a show like I have with Stranger Things in a really long time. This brief, eight episode sci-fi series had me glued to my television, begging for more at the end of each hour, and I am absolutely devastated that it's over. This series - seemingly out of nowhere - managed to do so many things so incredibly well that it was, quite honestly, staggering, and my only complaint is that it felt like it was over too soon. From the terrific acting to the truly engaging plot, Stranger Things not only stands out as maybe the best original content out of Netflix to date, but one of the best new series in quite some time. The crux of Stranger Things' narrative is the young Will Byres (Noah Schnapp) going missing in the small town of Hawkins. After his disappearance, locals in the town - namely the boy's mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder) and his three friends - begin to notice strange goings on. Electrical interferences, paranormal activity and shadowy government cover upsthat sort of thing. Over the course of the first few episodes, Will's friends meet a young government lab escapee who has been dubbed 'Eleven' (Millie Bobby Brown), El for short, who demonstrates some curious abilities. She can manipulate things with her mind, and is able to communicate with people between different dimensions. Being that she escaped from a government facility though, she is being hunted by a team of g-men and comes to rely on the group of boys, specifically Mike (Finn Wolfhard) for her safety.Of course this is just a broad overview of what is one of the most well thought out plots in a sci-fi series to date. Stranger Things goes places, and is paced incredibly well. There is exactly the right level of push and pull. Just as a question is answered, two more take its place. While this might sound tedious, it's all handled impeccably, and you never feel cheapened by the string of mystery leading you through the different characters' lives and interactions. Which is another area that Stranger Things excels. I never once stopped being impressed by the acting in Stranger Things. Winona Ryder is great as the frazzled mom going out of her mind with concern for her missing son, and David Harbour is outstanding as the towns police chief who sticks his nose where it doesn't belong, but the real stand out performances come from the four kids. Wolfhard, Brown, Matarazzo and Mclaughlin are talented beyond their years, and they positively steal the show. Wolfhard and Brown in particular work off each other undeniably well, and show more on-screen chemistry than actors ten years their senior. I could go on about the relationship between Mike and Eleven, but in the interest of remaining mostly spoiler-free, take my word for it, it's powerful, emotional, adorable and up there with some of the most stellar acting I've seen from anyone, regardless of age.From the get go, Stranger Things wears its influences on its sleeve. It's a love letter to shows like Twin Peaks and horror fiction like the writings of Steven King. The score is dripping with a synthesized sound reminiscent of the music of John Carpenter. There's even some nods to the audience in the form of posters for movies like Evil Dead adorning walls, or characters watching Carpenter's The Thing. It does so much to let the viewer know that it's aware of where it comes from, and that it's okay with that. It rather masterfully uses tropes that we're familiar with from these other series and films as jumping off points to create its own story and universe. Stranger Things is pieces of so many things without ever becoming too much of something else. It's so much of Steven Spielberg, Steven King, David Lynch, Freaks and Geeks, but it's more than the sum of its parts. It's a wonderfully acted trip descent into the world of government cover-ups. It's a truly believable and heartwarming friendship between kids that come from completely different worlds. It's an inter-dimensional horror series complete with terrifying creature design. More than that, it's a brilliant combination of the three, and one of the most thoroughly enjoyable experiences I've ever had watching a season of television start to finish. The second season has a lot to live up to, and the cynic in me has a hard time believing that lightning has a chance of striking twice, but hey, stranger things have happened."
354,"Season 1 and 2 of Stranger Things have a special place in my heart. The characters, the way how the story is unfolding and especially the atmosphere supported by a great, fitting soundtrack have totally done it to me. If season 3 would have been nearly on that level, i would probably rate this show with 9 or even 10 stars.Unfortunatly this not the case. Season 3 delivers a totally cliche and very uninspired plot, the mystery in the show got replaced by bad comedy and the charcters are not that strong anymore. Stranger Things also lost its feel for subtlety.If you like mystery or the 80s in general, there is no way around Stranger Things Season 1 and also Season 2, but avoid Season 3, it will be a big disappointment, unless you care more for action and some laughs then interesting storytelling."
355,"Actually, I was in love with this TV series. The 1st and 2nd seasons were just perfect. This atmosphere of Hawkins, story line and actors make me watch it over and over again, make me addicted to them. I looked forward to 3rd season and then when it was released....The 3rd season is trash, absolute garbage, that atmospere, story line, ""angry russians"" ruined everything. I hope they will improve this ""things"" in their future. They have to.
Still 9/10 though because of first seasons"
356,"Like many have said, the first season really shines. The second manages to keep it interesting but the in the third season they turned the 80's dial to 11 and it doesn't really sound good anymore."
357,"Second horrible. While the first series keeps you in tension and you can't wait for the next episode, the second is boring and you are waiting something to happen in the plot.
Third series is simply a disaster in all aspects:
bad evil russians - do they really need to mix politics even here? I thought they can create something more unique, with Russian spot they simply destroyed the whole show and became another boring predictable tv show..monster can find/sense the kids on miles, but when the monster is in the mall, can't find them behind the car?very poor and long dialogueswho's the spectator - kids? adults? families?what will be in the next series - bad evil Chinese? OMGHuge huge disappointment, and I hope they will end the whole show.. It can't be even compared to Dark, where the next series is much better than the first one, and even the first one was absolutely great."
358,"Episode 6 especially, just awful. The ice cream shop guys storyline is absolutely preposterous.
Sad.."
359,"If anything, Stranger Things is now on my list of one of my most favorite shows of all time. It has drama, comedy, thrills, and lot's of 80's references. I 100% think this show is absolutely amazing, make sure to watch it as soon as you can."
360,"Wow this brings me back. The Duffer Bro really nailed it with these series. Everything is extremely well thought out to make it a perfect 80's, Steven King experience. from the clothing to to the camera work, the build up of suspense and the music...aaahh the music. Loved it. Only minor downsides are the use of CG instead of maybe Stan Winstond's puppets and the fact it's in HD and not VHS quality ;) I'm definitely going to watch this again on a old tube if I can find one by the trash some where! Really looking forward to season 2! Oh and don't change anything for the next season please. Keep the style and everything intact."
361,"It's a waste of time...they are always fighting, arguing, non-sense dialogues..."
362,"Don't get me wrong I loved the thrill and the atmosphere the first season created! It was like a combination of old classic 80's horror with 00's! But from season 2 until the end of season 3 it is unwatchable and cringe. Too much screen-time on the teenage love and drama than the main plot of the series. Characters didn't evolve that good and the cast wasn't as good as they were in season 1. I'm going to miss any future seasons but that depends on your taste, so have fun!"
363,"The strangest thing about this show is the fact that it is such a huge success. It is presented as an ""original"" series, but there's not a single character or situation in it that you haven's seen dozen times in other movies or TV shows before - just check the IMDb trivia and you will see what I mean. Conspiracy theory? Check. Government cover-up? Check. Alien/extra-dimensional monsters? Check. Shy and sensitive boy falling for the popular girl who dates a fool? Check. Worn-out cop who gets a new break? Check. You name it - if it is a cliché, you will find it here. The cast is OK. Millie Bobby Brown is great and the other kids are good, but Matthew Modine looks uncomfortable as a villain whose voice we barely hear. This show has the undeniable virtue of being addictive and you can easily binge- watch it on a single free day, but then you ask yourself: ""So what?"" I had fun, but I as bored at some points and didn't feel like I had watched a great show like the Marvel and DC pieces I've been going through these days."
364,"After a great first season, a second .. not so good one already, this was the disappointment of the year. Teenage love stories, childish dialogues, poor acting and all possible boring and simply impossible situations. Even or maybe especially Russians cannot be that blind, stupid and fitted with these make-believe clichés. The sherif has mentally fallen back to ""Kindergarten"" level. Too much teenager ""bla blas"". Stopped watching after painful 1,5 episodes"
365,"Evil Russians... The dumb Russian that befriended the American... wtf.I thought we were past this. Every time hate was unleashed against Russians, I cringed. It made me feel like I should vote for Trump.Should we hate another race in the next season? You get where all this comes from and where it leads to?I think Stranger Things should be filtered off from political issues just because it's completely out of context in its plot. I'm thinking this Stranger Things season is the last for me. I swear to God if Stranger Things 4 has Korean enemies I WILL vote for Trump, just to feel I'm part of this great American society.Stop being mediocre, Duffers. It's not all about money. We ARE going to die anyways. Might as well create something worth talking about in the future. I'm gonna go now and try to apologize to my Russian friends for having a US Citizenship."
366,"First season was OK for the teen horror genre, but by the third season, I wanted to play a drinking game around ""Spot the 1980s teen-scream horror movie trope"", Everything from King Kong, to zombies to Freddy Kruger.Thing is, I never liked 1980s B-horror flicks much the first time around, and whether its rip, a cinematic derivative of a cult genre, or paying homage to nostalgic audiences .. trashy B-films are still trash to me. Gets a few points for Season 1."
367,"Season 1 was wonderful, and season 2 was nearly as good with a greatly enhanced budget and scope. But season 3 is crap.The kids are no longer charming and fun - they're annoying angsty teenagers, obsessed with relationships and being teenagers (apart from Will, who gave by far the best performance of the series with his powerful outburst over the others turning their backs on childhood while all he wanted to do was stay a kid).The main villain was too overpowered and difficult to believe. A big crawling invincible spider of goop and teeth that had no business losing a fight, making the fight scenes feel really far fetched. It could (and would) have shredded them all in minutes... If massive goop & teeth spiders were real...And the violence and adult content was turned up way too much for my taste. This started as a show the family could enjoy, which was a big part of its charm; but this season is bloody gore from beginning to end. People are torn apart, blown to pieces, melted, stabbed and gunned down liberally, there are drug references, endless swearing including a few attemps and F bombs, and the whole thing generally feels too adult for charming old Stranger Things. The show has really lost itself to become part of the Netflix 15+ club (seriously, try finding a show on Netflix that isn't at least 15+), and completely lost its ""naff"" 80s charm.I won't be back for S4."
368,"I have been a TV show buff for a long time, but i've always been too lazy to write any reviews. As good as some of the stuff i've seen over the years was (e.g. Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, House of Cards, Firefly, Sopranos, etc.), nothing has ever compelled me to get off my idle butt and actually put into words how i feel about it. Well, at least until now. Because finally there is a something that is so absolutely, mindblowingly good, that it feels like i don't really have a choice but to try and tell the world about it.This show is something special. The storytelling, the cinematography, the acting (including the child actors), the pacing, the music, the 80's nostalgia and pop-culture references, even something as trivial as the opening credits and title screen... everything about this show screams perfection. I'm curious what Netflix will throw at us next. I don't expect they will be able to maintain this level of quality with their future productions, but even coming close to it every now and then would probably put them ahead of the competition, including HBO.In summary, i think Stranger Things is a masterpiece and pretty much the best TV production i've ever seen. If it was a movie, it would rank among my top 5 movies of all time, that's how good it is. If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to watch it ASAP. You won't regret it :)"
369,"Not as big of a disappointment as True Detective: Season 2, but close.This series, unlike TD, had the advantage of giving us the same characters and locations we came to know (and perhaps love) in the first season -- enough familiarity to satisfy the casual viewer at any rate, but hardly quality TV. Just as with True Detective, I kept wondering whether to turn it off, whereas season 1 was binge fodder if I ever saw it. What's really frustrating, though, is seeing all the deliberate yet unnecessary missteps made by the Duffer brothers. They got into their heads that because it would be unfair to the supporting cast or because we might be fed up with Mike that it would be a good idea to offer these same secondary characters more screen time. Wrong. Dustin was given some of the most cringe-worthy and unbelievable lines of dialogue in the whole series, and Lucas's forced romance with Max had zero chemistry. We also had to deal with a tedious love triangle (surrounding Nancy) that had already been given satisfactory closure at the end of season one. Next, why all the off-tone scenes? The inexplicable moment in which Billy and Mike's mom have an impromptu flirting session should clearly have been cut from the final product. What about the absurd bond that Dustin appears to create with the demodog? All this contributed to turning what would have perhaps been a passable-to-mediocre sequel into something genuinely bad.The Duffer Brothers would do best to take a long break from screen-writing until they find some real inspiration, rather than continue phoning it in for big bucks and fan service, they lest they ruin what could have been a unique and valuable franchise. And please, let's just pretend Chicago and episode 7 never even happened!"
370,"9? This is what happens when a culture of hype, trend and Netflix zombies rate things. Ratings no longer signify a good movie or show. They just shows what's trending. How did this crap ever get made? Did someone notice a bunch of online teens saying that they're 80s or that they wish they were 80s and Netflix decided to make a show on a Web trend? This whole show is just a spot the 80s game and it's boring after the first movie poster. It's inferior to every movie it takes from. The episodes and show itself don't stand apart or have an individual strength. At heart its more 90s then 80s with the boring Dawson's Creek type love story. But Netflix are catering for the teen girl binge viewer. The characters are awful and interact on only simple terms. Like the kids always bicker because that's what kids do. They go on adventures on crap bikes because the Goonie did therefore all kids in the 80s.The grieving mom is crazy but in the end right because that's what happens to characters in generic shows. The cool outsider listens to The Smiths even though they're not even out yet (year out.) I wonder if he'll get the girl??? That would be a surprise. The cop is disillusioned and then by the most basic character development he eventually won't be. Every plot in this show as well as the dialogue is predictable. The show obviously has plans to run a long time because it's so stretched out and slow. Nothing happens and then at the end something will to fool you into watching the next one. Watched by people who want to be part of a trend. Did I mention it's 80s? Well that makes it good. Most people watching this weren't even born in the 80s yet seem to judge it's authenticity. Horror? What horror? And that character 11 or whatever her name is. She just plays the generic alien learning human ways. E.g Ways? What's. ..ways? Love? What's. ...love? Christ almighty this show is trash."
371,"Stranger Things is a very well-made show. The acting is fantastic (especially from the children), it's cinematography is beautiful and it's great at creating a feeling of dread.By all means, Stranger Things should be phenomenal, but it has one huge flaw, a flaw which I believe derails the show.The Duffer Brothers claim the show is a love-letter to 80s Sci-Fi. After watching this show, I can confirm that The Duffer Brothers have no idea what a homage is.A homage shows respect to a previous decade/genre, but Stranger Things doesn't do that. Stranger Things goes the Scary Movie/Seth MacFarlane route of excessively referencing other works. This wouldn't be such a problem if the references weren't so blatant or frequent.The show loves to name drop (""Maybe she's an escaped loony?"" ""Just like Michael Myers!"", ""I was making out with Chrissy Carpenter.), place movie posters in the background or foreground (The Thing, The Evil Dead) or sometimes even lift scenes directly from other works (The scene where Mike hides Eleven from his mother is almost identical to a scene in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial).Stranger Things feels like it was created by that one annoying kid everybody knew who thought he was so cool because he had some knowledge of popular culture before his time.A big disappointment for somebody who was hoping for a lot more."
372,"The Duffer Brothers are master chefs. I picture them around a stove arrayed with pots.""Let's add a dash of 'The Goonies', sprinkle in some 'Stand By Me', a generous cupful of 'E.T.', a spritz of 'Poltergeist' and garnish with 'Tron'.""They expertly captured the essence of 80's movies while at the same time telling a suspenseful and thrilling story. I excitedly watched episode after episode and felt satisfied after each viewing. Nothing went to waste. Each character was fully explored, each plot line fully developed, and in the end I felt more satisfied than when I binged on too much Christmas turkey and lay half comatose under the tree playing Space Invaders on the green shag carpet of my family room floor. Whoever the Duffer Brothers are, I wish to convey my heartfelt appreciation for this AMAZING show. P.S. The casting and acting were spot ON! Eleven, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas stole the show."
373,"Oh dear, oh dear, where to begin. As the summary suggests we loved the first season, yes, it had its flaws, mainly in the terrible script but we (the people I watched it with) forgave that in light of a gripping, well paced narrative.My biggest gripe about ST2 is the poor mechanics. By this I mean the story doesn't work. The continuation of how principle characters from ST1 behave in ST2 doesn't add up. When you acknowledge that that target audience for this is the 30-40 age bracket, meta-geeks and nostalgia-nuts who remember the films, music, games, culture of the 1980's, you must pay tribute to the intelligence that this group of people bring. OK, I'll say it, we're geeks and geeks like things to make sense.Dusting would not treat a baby demagorgon as a pet, nor would he hide it. Hopper behaves practically like a jealous lover, a Jozef Fritzl to Eleven. Eleven barely spoke in ST1. So many incongruities. The top secret HAL lab, that anyone can just roll up to and gain access. What annoys me the most is that the Duffer Brothers have created a story of total rubbish, they have trampled over the credibility of the characters they successfully developed in ST1. They have done with ST2 what Disney have done to Star Wars: repackaged the original with louder bangs and hoped that the audience doesn't call them out on a flagrant cashing in on a premise with no substance.Ultimately, I know I shouldn't care, but I do because I love ST1 and I hate ST2 for it's lazy storyline, it's awful script and really shoddy CGI."
374,Boring and misogynistic. Not keeping my interest at all.
375,"I love the idea of the show and the works that it is inspired by but there is one glaring issue that I can't get past; THE CHARACTERS. It might just be me but I find all of the characters so unlikeable. I actually really enjoyed ""I Am Not Okay With This"" a show with a similar plot but infinitely more likable characters. I also thought that ""I Am Not Okay With This"" touched on emotion in a much more realistic and all around more enjoyable light."
376,"SPOILERS GALOREI was predisposed to like this show. I wish Hollywood produced genre movies as good as the 80s classics, such as Aliens, The Terminator, The Lost Boys, you name it. I played D&D when I was younger. Midway through the first episode, I had high hopes.But the cracks started to form fairly quickly. I kept watching, hoping that it might get better. Eventually, I got to the point where I knew that it wouldn't, but I wanted to see how bad the ending was.Now come the spoilers. I can't really tell you how flawed this series is without getting to the final episode.There was not a single surprise. To say that this show was predictable was an understatement.The acting ranged from OK to awful. Winona Ryder's googly-eyed mania was painful to watch. The best actor in the show was the young girl who played Eleven. Her quiet expressions made some scenes more interesting to watch than they would have been otherwise.Some of the mysteries of the series never see resolution. For example, how did Will communicate through the lights? Especially if, when you're in the Upside Down, you can't perceive the world on the other side?The series was too long. At least a couple of episodes consisted mostly of people walking around, driving around, going here to there without the story advancing anywhere. A two-hour movie could have told this story.The monster wasn't that interesting. Better that we never saw it fully. Also, how does an apex predator survive in a lifeless world? Just wondering. Of course, when the series runs for several hours, you have time to ponder these questions.Here's another one: How did the bad guys' MAJESTIC 12 base operate in a completely undetected fashion? Did dozens of people live on the base, with no contact with the outside world, for years? Be that as it may, they were stunningly inept, to the point of hilarity.And the end really wasn't the end. The chief bad guy might not be dead. The monster might not be dead. Eleven isn't dead. The young boy who goes missing in the beginning is coughing up alien slugs, but doesn't tell his parents. No resolution of any plot point, in a cheap bid for another season. (Note to the writers: Why not just start another plot, as other series have done?)A big disappointment, from someone who was ready for something good."
377,While I realise that different strokes are for different folks for the life of me I am gob smacked how this has such high ratings. One could argue that this is simply a SciFi film but come on dudes this is at best a remake of ET except ET was actually quite a decent film.It is the biggest pile of rubbish I have ever watched. Slow in the beginning - even slower in the end. Acting is terrible and dialogue is pathetic. Seen a review that says only watch if you are U22 years of age. I sayDO NOT BOTHER TRYING TO GET INTO THIS. Utter tripe !! vs Wasting appoximatly 8 hours of your life
378,"I heard about this series and really was looking forward to seeing it, but I was very disappointed.First of all, there's no way it gets as high a rating as it has without every Netflix employee going on and giving it a ten.IMDb is great, but it can't stop the fraud going on here.But back to the series. I watched all 8 episodes, hoping it would get better, but it only go worse.Now I know why Winona Ryder hasn't had many offers lately. She's a terrible actress. The whole time she has this facial expression like she's a deer in the headlights. It's very annoying to watch her pretend to be obsessed with finding her son.Actually, none of the characters were properly developed. None are likable, except maybe the sheriff.And as several others noted, this is a ripoff of every horror, scifi story ever written.Can't anyone come up with something original and well written?"
379,"I have seen a lot of new shows make their debut on network TV, Premium Cable, and of course streaming services like Amazon and Netflix. But this... Phenomenal show, imo best new show of 2016. The whole cast is excellent but Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers deserves Emmy Award consideration next year. Her being a Hollywood actress i expected great but this was masterclass character work. Winona has had some exception performances over two decades but this was one of the best of her career, maybe top 5 in her career. Also the performance from child actress Millie Brown as El aka Eleven is also amazing and is the 2nd best performance behind Ryder. This isn't the first show of this current generation to try and capture a artistic, creepy, and psychological noir style of an 80's film vibe... but unlike the others it nailed it perfectly. The first season is literally flawless in all phases ( only the snarkiest of reviewers and critics will find something to nitpick ). This is a must watch for everyone. Season 1 was only 2nd to Person Of Interest's 5th and final season on my ""Best season of any show this year"" List."
380,"Stranger Things is written & directed by The Duffer Brothers and stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard, Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, Noah Schnapp and Cara Buono.When a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief, and his friends must confront terrifying forces in order to get him back.Where to begin? Stranger Things is one of the most enjoyable pieces of television that I've experienced in years. With a satisfying eight episodes in its first season, The Duffer Brothers have delivered a multi- genre masterpiece that has taken the world by storm.The writing throughout is smart and compelling, lending every actor/actress a real chance to delve into their respective characters and they all do so with impeccable skill. It's extremely difficult to pick out the highlighting performances when every single one of them were outstanding. But, I must mention the following names in appreciation of their talent. Millie Bobby Brown is seriously convincing in her portrayal of the mysterious Eleven (or 'Elle'), and although only twelve years old, she gives one of the most incredibly diverse and grown-up performances I've ever seen. Winona Ryder plays a distraught Joyce, mother of Will, who goes through many stages of emotional despair, breaking down and falling apart as she searches for her son, in an impressive and relatable act. Charlie Heaton follows Ryder in this path but takes a slightly different direction as he becomes one of the many powerful leads in the series, within a couple episodes. Heaton has undeniable chemistry with co-star Natalia Dyer (playing Nancy) and they both share some interesting moments together, most notably, in the final three episodes. David Harbour plays police chief, Jim Hopper, and progressively propels into his character as he digs deeper into the strange 'missing boy' case. Last but certainly not least, the Kids (Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo & Caleb McLaughlin) are enthralling, fascinating and hugely entertaining as they search for their friend, Will (Noah Schnapp), and ultimately take the screen with surprisingly genuine, adult performances. Highlighting Matarazzo (Dustin) and Wolfhard (Mike) as my consistent favourites during my experience with the show.Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein are in control of the score, taking huge inspiration from the 1980s, using synthesisers to construct an incredible ensemble soundtrack that in some way feels like its own character. Along with the show taking critical acclaim, the soundtrack manages to find an audience, be it fans of the show, composers, directors, producers, it seems everyone wants this sound in their work. Dixon & Stein have crafted and presented a stunning score, from the opening theme to the closing credits.Something the show creators, set decorators, designers and costume departments have worked hard on is featuring many references paying homage to classic 70s/80s movies, and while it's packed with them, the writers strive in staying original in the storytelling. The plot is seemingly simple, yet once you begin watching you notice how complex it really is. Every episode is filled with mystery and tension. Even when you think the story is heading somewhere predictable, it alters drastically and heads off in another direction. I strongly believe that this is greatly due to its short run of eight episodes. There's no 'filler' episode in this show. It's an entirely fast-paced, energetic and powerful running length which will have you binge watching until you've seen it all. Lucky for us, a second season has been confirmed by Netflix, with a further nine episodes coming in 2017.Verdict; There's simply nothing quite like Stranger Things. It's enthralling, engaging, emotional, heartfelt, funny, smart, complex and certainly entertains the viewer. Did I mention it also has a killer soundtrack? You're right, I did. - Stranger Things is now streaming on Netflix.Stranger Things: Season One, 10/10."
381,"The series was Epic in the first season, there is a start to its level, I am afraid of the fourth season"
382,"One of the best sci-fi series available on Netflix
Everything is balanced-comedy, fantasy, horror, drama. Characters connects us, Superb acting by the kids, Especially @millie bobby brown(Eleven). It is well directed, & VFX work is Awesome. I felt it could have reduced to 6 or 7 episodes in all 3 seasons.
My rating for this is (S1- 9/10) (S2- 8/10) (S3- 7/10)"
383,"Best Netflix original ever
Exciting, heartbreaking, and sometimes scary, Stranger Things acts as an addictive homage to Spielberg films and vintage 1980s television.
This show is so fantastic. It's compelling, energetic, and fresh. It is a vortex, sucking you into a little town in Indiana during the 80's. The dynamics of the characters are so thoughtful. We see the point of view of children, teenagers, and adults, all fighting to keep their town alive without knowledge of the others. The story, no matter what season, brings the characters together to challenge the world of the Upside Down. It's dark, it's edgy, it's pure bliss. The best show on television. Well, streaming. The best show."
384,"Season 1: 10/10
Season 2: 9/10
Season 3: 3/10Seasons 1 & 2 were definitely must see tv.I recommend not watching season 3 if you aren't into seasons 1 & 2. Why? Because if you thought seasons 1 & 2 were just ok...then season 3 will definitely make you ill.Advice for those fans of seasons 1 & 2: Don't watch season 3 because it will make you have bad thoughts about the show in general, when it really is awesome."
385,"First season had a decent premise, but let's be honest, it got carried mostly by Nostalgia, yeah, looking at you Winona. The acting is pretty decent, but the plot is super flat. If you are 15 (or 60) you might like this, otherwise, go watch Dark, it's a hundred times better, you're welcome."
386,"The first season was very good, but then the 2nd and 3rd were bad. It was more about teenage love than the sci fi part. Too bad"
387,"Just finished binge watching the entire first season. Not a bad show and entertaining enough.Chuck Carrie, Poltergeist, Stand by me, The Goonies, E.T. and a touch of Resident Evil into a blender and you end up with something like this show. They done a great job in creating a show that feels like a genuine 80's blockbuster including Synthesiser Score and all.The acting and script are great and you will actually care about the characters.The first 4 episodes are a little slow but never boring. Not much re-watch value but an entertaining show none the less."
388,"The fantastic thing about this series is the children. Terrific, scene-stealing performances from all four of them. Nailed nerdy boys, abused girl, budding romance, and everything in-between.But the story itself -ugh? Derivative drivel. A federal institution with this level of interest is handled poorly by a small cadre of ""scientists."" If this kind of operation were to occur, it would be handled in a much more sophisticated manner, even back in the day. The kids out-running the police story device is not believable. Just too many warmed over tropes.Harbour's hard-bitten, sullen demeanor feels dialed in. Winona plays what seems to me a high-pitched parody of Owen Wilson. Neither of their performances moved me positively. Paired together they are almost believable. Even then, that they succeed where better trained personnel fail miserably is just sophomoric.The kids compel - the story is poor and the adults are merely staging."
389,This is big soda company advertisement and is not good for kids a lot of gore looks like the fly...and people with epilepsy has to watch with care a lot of flashing lights like a discotheque!
390,The first and second season were great but I literally had to skip through the third season. Really disappointed.
391,"Really a 6/10 but I had to give a 1/10 but its getting overrated.The show follow the 80s so by the book, it's hard to get any message from it. Is it it good? well almost.... almost...Winona Ryder and David Harbour manage to carry the show through weaker parts. The kids are cringeworthy but believable. The show sometimes follows old plots and 80's theme so hard, it just loses focus. It's become almost a parody in some parts. The production values are good. It surprisingly didn't feel cheesy. Still it lost itself following/imitating better movies.Only watch if you YOU want too. Your not missing anything by not watching it, Its IS overrated."
392,"I had HIGH hopes for this show. My mistake. Do you like plot holes, horrific acting (Winona Ryder), nonstop yelling for no reason (Winona Ryder), and unintelligible writing (the entire show), then this is the show for you. Since it seems America loves stupidity, this show is a major hit."
393,"Season 1 was amazing. The story was robust and characters had reason to be in the show. It conveyed the 80s feeling with a good blend of 80s music.Season 2 was good. The main story line was solid still although there were some questionable parts to it. Some characters were cheap and not well developed.Season 3 was garbage. It seemed like the writers were tasked to see what people liked about the show and just fill the story line with them. It had excessive use of brands. The 80s music were just injected every where for no reason: every time a person entered the scene, 80s music was blasting loudly. Dialogs were extremely predictable and cheesy. Each character's personality was unnecessarily exaggerated: Hopper is always angry and unreasonable, Erica was constantly sassy but the smartest person ever, the mayor is the worst person in the world, the whole newspaper crew were excessively mean. And finally, the whole plot with the Russians was cheap and not at all well thought out. It was hard to finish the season really."
394,"Don't know why this series is so overrated. There is no real storyline. The writers are just really really extending the series with ridiculous plots. Plus bad acting makes it more awful. They are running out of ideas and now for season 4, the story involves Evil Russians. really?? A sane person would find this very hard to watch. Should've ended after season 1 with some dignity.
If you want a real thriller, go watch Dark."
395,"This was an astonishing film.I was slowly captured and confidently wheeled in, and what a ride! It portraits an honorable homage to all the movies I loved watching when I was 10-13. Spielberg certainly comes to mind, but also some of Carpenters work, and dare I say Stephen King. The nod to Dungeons & Dragons is classy but also tone-setting.In spite of the many thrills during the series, it does not use CGI or scary-tricks a lot, which I think is very refreshing watching the current tendencies.The series works with values such as relationships between parents and children, best friends, and even a slight touch of romance. But, like in the eighties, the core value is friendship. Oh, and the soundscape is hypnotic!"
396,"New 80s is trending right now. However, this series offered a sense of nostalgia rarely felt in other movies and series such as this one. Character exploration is beautifully done, and most characters have idiosyncratic traits which makes them quite interesting. Each character's history also ties into the main story line perfectly, leaving few loose ends. The acting is on point with some strong performances and directing is brilliant in regards to the mood being created and the intricate details of the 80s era. Together they've certainly been able to create a wonderful and terrifying world with an original and fascinating story-line.This series features kids, teens and adults and I really feel as if they are there to offer that enhanced sense of nostalgia. I certainly doubt it was to appeal to younger kids which this series is obviously not directed towards. Most of us have lived through such experiences and ordeals, so it offers that sense of ubiquitous normalcy, but which is set against the backdrop of complete chaos which shatters that false sense of security, the perfect way to create a reality-disrupting nightmare.One of the few drawbacks was its predictability. I didn't even have to try to guess what would happen next, I just did. I might have enjoyed a few sleight of hand misdirection plot twists but this still really falls in line with classic 80s movies, so even that was welcomed here.and the soundtrack is just an absolute bonus.Which is why I gave this a 10/10, they couldn't have done it any better. I am certainly bias, being a huge fan of everything 80s, sci-fi, horror and new retro wave, but this is an absolutely memorable series that will stay with me for a very long time."
397,"An amazing nostalgia driven story, but also mysteriously thought provoking and scary. Stranger Things gives us a mash up of several cult hits like, The Goonies, IT, and ET. The show always seems to end an episode by sinking its claws a little deeper each time and really has you caring for these characters by the end.IE(Hop). Winona Ryder returns in great form and delivers a great performance. Her range of emotions of a grief stricken and angry mother shines through. David Harbour also shines as his character, but I think the real shining performance was those of the four main kids, who are all great and feel genuinely real of time period.(80's) Great fun and well recommended. Netflix keeps knocking it out the park with great intriguing stories."
398,This was nominated for a golden globe? and not twin peaks... wtf? this is all Lynch-like
399,"Described as an homage to the 80s, Stranger Things feel more like a second rate mix of Spielberg's anything produced in that decade, the Twilight Zone, a touch of Stephen King, Alien and countless horror movies.The series targets teenagers, who apparently fell for it big way. Also nostalgic fellows with a soft spot for synthesizers, the main source of the ""period"" soundtrack.The plot is set in motion by four boys cycling at night through a dark wood -> cliché. Will, one of the boys goes missing after meeting an unseen but horrible creature -> cliché. The police starts combing the dark forest holding shaky flashlights -> cliché. More searching will be done, ALL in dark places and ALL with shaky flashlights. This series of clichés is compounded by a truckload of others, crushing any possible foray into uncharted territory. For instance, Will's mother is hysterical and behaves crazily, but everybody knows she is right and misjudged by society.To hit even better the teenage target, the key character is El (for 011, the number tattooed on her arm), a pre-pubescent girl, who cannot talk normally and communicates via rolling her big eyes and muttering a few words. Obviously there would not be much ""suspense"" if El would just give a detailed account of her experience, but the contrivance of her silence is annoying.Yet more teenage angst is added with a sub-plot involving the sister of one of the boys, her sexual escapades and the abduction of her best friend. A little bit more of the scary monster is shown in each episode, in proper horror movie fashion, waiting for denouement in the last episode - where we will be shown how evil is the government and how brave is anybody under twenty, plus Will's mother.A paint by number futile exercise in nostalgia that does not even work on the horror- supernatural angle, due to over-predictability. High rating demonstrate how successful is show-business at scraping the bottom of the barrel and recycling overused storytelling formats for the ""benefit"" of younger audience."
400,"Bad writing relying on typical tropes, Monotonous dialogue, and A sloppy ending. The only spectacular part is the amazing branding which is the only saving grace. The show is completely hollow and devoid of uniqueness. Just go read an HP Lovecraft story instead ✌🏻"
401,"I've used IMDb for at least 10 years now.I never thought about making a review until I saw the first 4 episodes of Stranger Things. What is remarkable about this TV Show is the story writing, 90s nostalgia, the superb acting and everything else! There is never a boring or dull moment. You have everything from Theory of Relativity to teenage girl problems.It is one of those rare stories where a lot of craziness rules the world, but where all the characters are credible, like Lost or Game of Thrones.I have to say, I don't like to make any comparisons to other shows, like I just did. Because you will not know what to expect, since we live in a time where Hollywood mass produces generic Crime series with different covers. This show is truly original and will intrigue you."
402,"I'll start this with a little game myself and my friends engaged in two hours into this series: Guess the next line of dialogue?Will they say this? Yes! Funny.Will they say that? Yes. Amusing.Surely, they won't say this. Yes. Fun factor now worn thin.I cannot guess correctly five times in a row? Why, yes, sir, you can.Inspired by Steven King, Twin Peaks, or whatever other I've heard this referred to, it may have some merit but only in that the producers found a way of taking the best of those and others that went before it and reduced that artistry to the lowest common denominator, removing all originality, inspiration and insight. I thought after 2 hours I was actually watching a cartoon for 10 year olds.Now, maybe I should have given it more than 2 hours.Maybe, if I had tits, I could be my Aunt Agatha.No.Who is voting for this shallow dishwater?It's been done before, often, almost invariably better."
403,"Although it starts quite nice, it gets more awful by the minute. The dialogues appear as if spoken by the Teletubbies, everything is repeated at least twice. Winona Ryder (who used to be wonderful!) acts like a 70 year old lunatic witch with weird gestures and wide eyes, even the rest of the cast is screaming and yelling most of the time. The 3 main kids act completely over the top, including all those movements and slang kids use TODAY, but didn't in the 80s! The Natalia Dyer story line (please give her something to eat! She looks as if she is falling apart any time!) is schmaltzy beyond compare, and contains by far the stupidest acting. What is worst, there is probably not one original thought in the whole series, it is just one big mashup from Poltergeist to E.T., the Goonies, Indiana Jones' sidekick Short Round, even Minority Report. You name any other 80s' flick, it's there. But - and this is a huge big BUT - Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven) is absolutely amazing! Every gesture, every shy gaze rips your heart into pieces. She definitely deserves much better than this crap series."
404,Barely anything makes sense it is totally over rated. There is no point in watching this show it is an american propaganda against russians. Why russians where did they came from. Why are they there. It caould be anybody included teddy bears. No explanation for anything. Congrats you just filmed one of the worst tv shows there ever was.
405,Everybody knows how great this show is.... S1 was just awesome.... S2 was meh... S3 is good..... But the spark of S1 is missing..... As well the mystery aspect is at all not there in S3..... I hope they make a s4..... And bring the S1 magic
406,"Stranger Things is a Netflix original show created by the Duffer Brothers and it markets itself as a tribute to the classic1980's sci fi and horror culture. I saw the first season after having heard over and over again how great this show is, and immediately a few things stuck out for me, in regards to the show's originality. There is a fine line between paying homage to a book or a movie, and making a blatant rip off. And oftentimes, Stranger Things crosses this line. Some fans and critics have already said, that the writers of this show rely too heavily on nostalgia and on the source material they're supposed to be paying homage to. While recognizing most of the 80's sci fi references, and the plot elements that Stranger Things borrows (E.T., Alien, The Gonies, Stand by Me etc, etc), I also recognize references and entire plot lines that the writers of this show have taken from the 1990's TV-shows, like The X-files, Twin Peaks and even a lesser known sci fi thriller, The Pretender. There are entire scenes and story lines that look like they have been copied off of the X-files (even season 10, which came out last last year). It's difficult to find a modern show about the paranormal and supernatural that hasn't been inspired by The Twilight Zone, The X- files or Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I don't have a problem with that. The X-files was in turn inspired by Kolchak: the Night Stalker, from 1970's, and both the X-files and Stranger Things build their narratives on that ""80's paranoia and government mistrust"", as Chris Carter calls it.The problem is that when you borrow too much from older source material, and when you rely too heavily on the homages and nostalgia, you run the risk of compromising your own originality. And the lack of originality is Stranger Things' greatest weakness. This show doesn't break new ground; it doesn't surprise its audience that already knows their science fiction. Instead, it rehashes the plot elements that are over thirty years old and tells the same story that Chris Carter was telling us twenty years ago. The main antagonist in Stranger Things might as well be The Cigarette Smoking Man, sans the cigarette. The police chief who's drawn into this case, thinking that finding the boy will somehow help him deal with his own tragedies might as well be Fox Mulder or Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks. Or any other noir cop who drinks too much. And the mysterious science lab might as well be the secretive Centre from The Pretender. When critics and reviewers describe Stranger Things as ""Stephen King meets E.T. meets the Goonies, and with a pinch of X-files"" you know what you're dealing with - a potpourri of pop culture references. Well, I got most of those references. Do I get points for that now? Instead of coming up with something new, the writers repackage same old tropes and stories. It's the most shameless way to profit off of nostalgia and the audience's sentimentality. The creators sell us a poorly written story and underdeveloped characters wrapped in a neat bring-your-childhood- back package, hoping that we won't notice the bad product because of all the ""feels"". But it doesn't work for me. Because everything that Stranger Things has to show for - I have seen it before. I love old science fiction (it's basically all I read/watch); I love creepypastas and stories about shady government cover-ups, and this show seems to be made for people like me. But while I'm watching that very first scene, I know that I've seen this before. And I can make a qualified guess about what's going to happen in the next scene. And in the next episode (and I'm right on the money). Every plot twist, every development is recognizable and traceable back to the 80's and 90's source material this show borrows from, which only makes the next twist all the more predictable. Nostalgia baiting and lazy writing, that's basically hat Stranger Things is. That, and hype. Lots and lots of hype."
407,"That's the problem with T.V. shows today and this show is one of the problems when it's going to end. In my opinion I'm tired of seeing the same laziness in shows like Stranger Things, Daredevil, Jessica Jones they all just guilty pleasure with no fresh ideas. And Neflix it's starting to become the huge problem of people laziness in finding anything to watch because they bored until the next new thing. Stranger Things is not an enjoyable show for the mind same thing could be said with Mr.Robot it's just guilty pleasure like Pretty Little Liars, Vampire Diaries, and The Walking Dead where they just going to keep dragging out the story until it doesn't make sense anymore. I have to stop this show before I get suck into another show with no entertaining enjoyment where I can relax and enjoy. Stranger Things is another stable show like Mr. Robot until something new comes long nothing is refreshing and no re watchable value like The Fresh Prince Bel- Air,Friends, Cartoon shows, some daytime sitcoms where you can relax and enjoy it over and over until it's call your favorite show you grown up watching where is the excitement in the show; I already been there and seen it before when I was a child. There's no need to go through with this again. A step back to child/Adult memory Stranger Things is nothing new it copies and paste from other classic movies and t.v. shows; it's getting boring find something refreshing you can enjoy to relax your mind, because this is another guilty pleasure 1/10 for this laziness. I will hold my options open until someone create something new and refreshing to call my favorite."
408,"If you are a person who enjoys philosophy, psychology and such. The finer, the greater things in life, than. This show is best avoided.If you decide to watch it, you'll have to sit and endure by all the half chewed, outdated, pathological forms of nonsense that are used the time instead of doing something with the ""real"" plot. It is a magnificent test of a ones own strength of character. The camera/vfx/editing crew is the only thing that keeps this show together. I feel for them.
This elaborated in my own form of caveman language would be:Oo, we money, bring camera crew, they good, people like them, make them shoot: man baad, man miserable, man weak, man oppress women, cop weak, man drunk, man problem..... and now important part we go, women good, women strong, women smart, women hero, women initiative, women independent, ooo yes, women yell to men, yes, no time for real plot, real plot not important, we has do this formula with all characters, shot this my caveman friend, it is what our caveman fans signed up for.It is in a way an offense to your intelligence."
409,"My review here is broken down into two seasons. Firstly, the first season blew me away. Within mere minutes the backing music kicks in warming my anticipation for what I imagine will be a wonderful homage to some of the greatest movies of the 80's. And that's exactly what it does, it takes us on a journey, much like it's theme tune, to places so familiar yet so fresh at the same time. It's as if it was a classic I forgot to watch, oozing influences from King, Spielberg and Carpenter and concepts from varied corners of cult movies, TV shows and video games. Once more to it's deserved merit, we leave season one with the story nicely rounded off but with enough of a door left wedged open to feel satisfied buy not mis-sold to. The performances were superb and felt genuine and hats off to the young cast that knock it out of the park.9/10 - one of the best shows ever...Now season two. Had season one not been so damned near perfect I'd have not been so critical with my perception of it's follow up. That said it still delivers what we showed up for. It carries on from the first filling in on plot elements that you'd perhaps question somewhat. However, what it falls down on is obvious references. Whilst the first touched familiar memories for me the second season seemed too blatant thus no longer did it feel organic. Kind of like when a kid does a funny dance and everyone cracks up then someone says ""do it again"" but the kid knows he's being funny and people smile and say ""oh yeh..."" less enthusiastically. I guess it became self aware, like Cyberdyne if we wanted to ironically throw a reference about it's use of references. Sure being such a fan of the 80s movies it referenced it was a guilty pleasure but we now lose how honest the first season felt and almost like the idea being 'reference-hard' was in hope to net viral stories to captivate fans of the cult movies that it 'references hard with a vengeance'. If I were to see Louis CK and he starting doing Bill Hicks routines I'd still laugh because I love Hicks but I turned up to see fresh material from CK. Obviously this is the main issue I had with the second series, each time it happened it broke the 4th wall a little, disengaging me from the plot. The second season starts strong but weakens in it's final few episodes. In parts becoming obvious and corny, the young kids making decisions for some of the adults lessened the integrity of those characters. The kids essentially muscling their way to being the main protagonists. Either way it was still a good watch and I am still in anticipation for a third instalment only this time with slightly lower expectations.6.5/10 – still a treat even though I felt a little tricked"
410,"This is a good series, not so bad actually, but the hype people are creating here is wrong. This is no where near Spielberg or Stephen King, calling it so is a massive disrespect to the legends. The show is a mediocre Science Fiction series, nothing more. The jump scares are really bad sometimes, the acting is not really good, sorry but I found Winona Ryder over acting a lot of the scenes. The series feels just plain old' stupid when people keep doing the most stupidest thing possible. I mean if you're standing on a wall and there's fire on one side of it, while piranhas' on the other side, where would you dive? A normal person would keep standing on the wall right... not here, people would look for the most dangerous possible route and follow it. Then regret their decision and surprisingly the lead cast would always make it back too. It's worth a watch, I did enjoy watching this, but a 9.0 rating?!!! seriously fanboys? I'm giving it a 1 just so that hype goes down, as it's false. This is definitely a 6 though. I did really love the 80's music - which was the best part of the 80's anyway..."
411,With mediocre storyline and acting this show is the most overrated show of all time.
412,"Not original at all, all the plot lines are re used from previous seasons. It relies way too heavily on nostalgia instead of actual plot. It's just as if Netflix thought : ""what's a good way to make money?"" And they just compiled a list of things they thought people would like and squeezed it into a show. An important part of a show is theme and pacing. I actually really liked season 1, but by season 3, it doesn't feel like the same show. All of the characters are one sided, the dialogue isn't believable, and the theme and colour palette completely changed. They drop plot lines left and right to the extent when the show is just straight up confusing, and not in an interesting way. Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown, and Noah Schnapp are all amazing, but the writing is predictable and boring. There just isn't anything special about Stranger Things. It isn't unique or interesting. Don't waste your time on it! Lots of shows are set in the 80s that aren't just a jumble of overused tropes. If you are looking for a sci-fi show that involves missing children, watch Dark on Netflix. The writing is incredible and the actors are phenomenal!"
413,"Great expectations of this series. But what have I been Looking at? ST = bad acting, slow, dull, boring, predicable, cliché after cliché, not original, ridiculous plot and without humor. How does this series rate 8,8?????"
414,"The bloom is off the rose in Season 3, which I found repetitious, predictable and over-produced. That often happens with successful TV series. There is a challenge since the young actors have reached an awkward age where it's hard to portray them as kids and you certainly want to avoid addressing their emerging sexuality head on. But what they've found as a solution (kissy-face) is really tedious. The young actors as well seem lazy in the application of their craft which was the hallmark of Season 1. They've fallen back on the McCully Culkin school of Home Alone screaming and mugging. It was particularly disappointing since they are so affecting ins the first two seasons (a ""Material Girl"" sequence in a mall with Millie Bobby Brown is really stomach curdling). The older actors fair better but they really aren't given much (new) to do.The plot assumes a lot from the viewer. Talking around the subject, there are a whole cadre of actors present that we really don't know why they are there. In material such as this (sci-fi) there needs to be some kind of internal logic that either we don't question or is explained. I had a lot of questions and zero was explained.We do get some cringe-worthy, stomach turning special effects and some new or extraneous character actors that really up the classiness of the production. Many are dispatched in a way that I regret. I'd like some of them to carry over to season 4. There's a dazzling addition of Maya Hawke who is given a central role paired with Joe Keery (to his benefit; their chemistry--which has a surprise--is wonderful) plus a late appearance by Gabriella Pizzolo (and she's worth the wait). Priah Ferguson given screen time that is worthy of her gifts. Her performance is fresh, droll and she needs to be put in charge of teaching our familiar group of nerds how to hold the screen. She's wonderful.For me, the final episode redeems a lot. It's really smashing and beautifully edited. It also is a worthwhile payoff to all the bloat we've sat through in the previous episodes of season 3. I thought this entire season could have been boiled down into a 2 hour feature and been much more satisfying. Let's hope the writers learn a lesson and give us much more than traveling down endless hallways for very little purpose."
415,"The high ratings for this show continue to surprise me a year later. Terrible, plagiarized tripe, from two brothers who would make the Chuckle Brothers look like the Coppola's.It just kept getting worse and worse - silly acting, predictable story- line plagiarised from countless 80's classics and dumbed-down to the extent where it became laughable. Truly sickening to see this utter tripe lauded by so many. I shall not be watching the second season of this garbage."
416,"I grew up watching a lot of 90's show where the main protagonist has some kind of super powers and this show is no different.The fact that it's tagged as Horror has nothing to do with ""horror"". Its like a toned down version of E.T movie for 8 year old kids.The show is mostly about a bunch of kids fighting to make themselves heard in an adult world, this is why this show is so popular among kids. The ""horror"" part of the movie is just an after thought.Stranger things keeps baiting the audience by dangling little hints of horror and super powers in 3 secs scenes just to keep the audience entertained and hooked, but the rest of the screen time is just petty problems of kids and adolescents trying to do the right things."
417,REVIEW - STRANGER THINGS Originally I didn't watch the first season as it was marketed as a kids program but I'm sitting here now binge watching the first season and this children's TV program literally outshines all others. A true masterpiece of story telling and the acting is the best I have ever seen. Amazingly gripping on all fronts. If there is one thing you do this Halloween then you must watch Stranger Things Rating 10 out of 10
418,"This feels like a you're watching classic Spielberg film that has been expertly constructed into a gripping series. It's nearly impossible not to like.(Though I should note, as a horror fan, this show has one or two scenes on par with Ash vs. Evil Dead)."
419,"S1 was fantastic , S2 was good but not as good as the first one ... S3 was a joke ... Same repeated formula with some additions + propaganda = Bad series"
420,"Season one was just amazing.
It was a work of art. I would rate it 9.5
The second and third season was fine, not more then that.
If they would have stopped after the first season it would have been remembered as one of the best tv series ever."
421,"1st season was the best. It has the best balance of suspense & 80s humor. 2nd season helped to extend the saga of ""little girl lost"" & scary monsters, though not as good as the 1st, but still watchable . The 3rd season had too much sitcom humor & lacked the charm of the 1st season. Not enough scary moments. 1st season 9 stars, 2nd = 7 stars & 3rd = 5 stars."
422,"Season one was pretty okay. It didn't have the ""wow"" factor and I wasn't hooked but I was willing to give it another shot so I watched season two. Season two was full of nonsense that just doesn't make much sense. The smaller dots just don't connect right. The main story in season two was unrevealed early on so there goes the mystery and suspense. I lost interest midway through. I hope they come up with better story and one that makes sense in season three. I don't think I will be following this show."
423,"I've watched both seasons and I have to admit I enjoyed the novelty of the first season and became disappointed with the second. Sure I get the whole 80's influenced mash-up thing. It is really enjoyable to recall the movies I watched back then. As a fan of all things Spielberg, John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, David Cronenberg and many others to boot, I liked the idea of paying those guys a revisit as an homage to their great works. Of course, this is the 80's we're talking about and SFX could be really ropey back then, so I thought a modern reboot would be just what the doctor ordered. Sadly, the SFX were OK in Season 1 and took a backward step in Season 2.First off, as everyone knows, as soon as you introduce anything with tentacles or root-like appendages there is a massive risk the whole show becomes a joke. It did and not in a good way. No matter how much the inappropriately and randomly used ""suspense"" music attempted to induce fear into the viewer I found myself horrified, in dismay.If returning to the 80's horror genre requires the viewer to remove any 21st century expectations, and transplant them with those of 40 years ago, then so be it but having been there, seen it, and done it I for one would prefer the source material over this derivative drivel. It is all so lazy and obvious. OK, I understand I'm knocking on a bit as an over 50 and this show is meant more for the ""youth"" demographic but puhleese! there is no reason why every scene, every aspect of film making, every note and beat has to anchor itself in the past. What I was hoping for was an updated version of the 80s, etc, not an inferior one. Parodies of the 80's horror genre have been done before and with much greater humour. Indeed, we've even had parodies of the parodies, which have amazingly worked well too. So the Duffer Bros (or should that be Doofus Bros) have no excuse for this.Some of the acting was up to par but other than that it falls way short of the mark. There's lots of social media comments about the cuteness of the kids, and how everyone would treat them way better than their contemporaries but all I see is a group of odd looking youngsters made to look utterly freakish by hair & makeup artists, who really don't like children. I guess that was the whole point but where was the humour to go with it? If it wasn't presented as a boxset I wouldn't have managed to make it to the end.In the end, it all comes down to the production being seemingly unsure in which direction the show should go. Horror? Comedy? Thriller? Sci- Fi? Action Adventure? Parodies must surely be more than a cut n paste of source material. A lot is said about plagiarism today and there is a fine line between that and a genuine homage. This season ventured further towards the former and used the latter as the excuse. If such shows as Stranger Things are to be worth watching they need to send the originals up (like Z Nation) or out gun them (like The Fringe). Sadly, Stranger Things 2 does neither and I cannot imagine how awful season 3 will be.C-, must do better."
424,"Yet another good Netflix production. This is a 10 stars out of 10. After watching the first 30 minutes I was hooked. I ended up watching the first season in one stretch. This series is a mix of Dean Koontz and Stephen King set in the late 70s. If you like to be scared, do like I did and watch it at night in the dark. I jumped out of bed and turned on the lights a few times. Not really suitable for kids unless they are accustomed to watch scary movies. No profanity that I can remember and no nudity. One short love scene that shows less than some TV commercials. The story line and suspense will keep you on the edge of your seat. Looking forward to next season. Perhaps eleven will be back... It is certainly set-up that way. Good job Netflix!"
425,Absolutely no original ideas in it!! Everything is so predictable... Not bad but far from good. You have to be 10 years old (or a lady Xerox-gaga fan) to be overwhelmed by this show which is just a copy of what has been done before. A very big disappointment! Everything here has been seen over and over again on screen and TV series so nothing to be surprised about. You can see from far what's coming up way before it actually happens. Of course it's all about the 80th but some original ideas would have been more than welcome. Nice series to watch but not much more than a 6/10. There is so many more series that are way better than this one. Let's hope there will be some changes in season 2 but i have a lot of doubts...its so easy to copycat.......
426,"Well Season 1 and 2 were great. Had a good plot. Season 3 is just running around just to drag the series without a reasonable flow, and too predictable too which is not great. I hate to see kids have been involved in such activities, and I think this is abnormal for 1980s, and kids language is absurd. These producers must think about to slow down the rate of devastation of the society."
427,"Some random adapted on the way scenery line... When something important is happening with one character they move the action to another character in a completely different hypostasis and so on... That's a stupid way to say ""we ran out of ideas on how to continue this part"" or ""let's get the stupid viewers on another thread so we can come out of the blue with continuing the last stage by omitting how the f... X suddenly got into a bed being nursed when the last time we saw X he was going to die"""
428,"I started watching this show expecting not to like it, simply because everyone around me had been hyping it so much, I felt I could only be disappointed. It didn't only NOT disappoint, but I got exactly why all those people, 80s kids like me, loved this show so much.We grew up watching E.T., Firestarter, Stand by me and Poltergeist, the last one, hiding behind the sofa for most of the film because our parents had realised it was too scary for elementary children and sent us to bed an hour ago.We all had walkie talkies that never quite worked as we expected them to, we all jumped at noises in the dark wondering what kind of monster (or benevolent alien) was lurking there and we all associated those heavy synthesizers with the ""something big's about to happen"" moment.And we are all very, very nostalgic geeks. The Duffer brothers didn't have a hard time making us happy, because they knew exactly what we wanted, and they delivered."
429,"I was a skeptical about another attempt to revive the 80s but ""Stranger Things"" really succeeded in many ways. It has served as a very smart pastiche of many of the films I have watched and loved as a kid in the 80s and - the list is so huge to mention here - as well as homage to Stephen King's works, the most obvious one being It .It is very amusing to see that the authors got to recreate the atmosphere of the 80s and tell a great story that it is still is entertaining and smart and gets you hoping for the next episode.In a way, this is another wonderful work that pertains to the same niche of art of Guardians Of The Galaxy, when the walls disappear and you are completely immersed."
430,"This is a pretty predictable TV show that's basically an adaption of Door to December by Dean Koontz, only with a lot of Stephen King / Steven Spielberg elements tossed in, especially from It, Goonies, Poltergeist, et cetera. The ""Duffer"" Brothers assumed that few people would recognize that, and they were right. The worst part is people will assume that MKUltra was something that this show created, and those of us who knew about it beforehand have to hear about it from fans of this show."
431,"I really enjoyed this Netflix series. It did take watching thru the 4th episode to finally stop finding all the comparisons to previous movies and start telling an original story.Examples: Opening episode music/The Knick - Location/Twin Pines - Kids on Bikes/E.T. - Nerdy kids in club/Goonies - Backlight/every Spielberg movie - Main kid's little sister with blonde pigtails (even though the rest of the family has dark hair/E.T. - Finding strange thing that can elevate things/E.T - Strange things haircut/Minority Report - Strange thing put in water to get information/Minority report - Communicating thru lights/Close Encounters - mom who talks to the lights - log lady in Twin Peaks - kid's walking on railroad tracks/Stand By Me - missing kid communicating thru walkie talkie/Dark Skies.I know you can find comparisons in every movie, but this series had so many in the first few episode that turned into a game. That said, once it became an original story I really enjoyed it. The actors are all great. Usually not a Winona Ryder fan, but she really won me over in this role."
432,"I believe the title of my review sums up the 3 seasons. I am done , first season was so good, the 2nd one was MMM a copy paste , it started off ok then went into bad mode, but the 3rd season !!!! What can I say , I don't think they could have ruined the show any better. now that's one ugly season"
433,"Season 1 was spectacular. Season 2 was tolerable. Season 3 is unwatchable. Ridiculous plot, unnecessary cussing and crudity, horrible dialogue with equivalently bad delivery. Except El who still shines. It's so juvenile that it will only appeal to kids but I wouldnt want mine to watch it."
434,I've never wrote a spoiler but here is what sums it up for 2 stars. Every single couple is broken apart at the end! And the one you were rooting for the most........ well the girl ends up being gay! Wow lame lame lame! Seriously there is nothing happy nor satisfying about the end. Not a gosh dang thing! Serious!
435,"Stranger Things rips a million other 80s and 90s franchises off. From alien, terminator, evil dead,classic spielberg and john carpenter movies to the resident evil/biohazard games, and then some. There rarely are ANY original concepts on display. The vast cast of main characters is rather unsympathetic. And the whole thing rides hard on the current retro nostalgia wave. On the bright side, season 3 has pretty good editing and directing, as opposed to the two previous seasons. If you are easily entertained and don't mind the ludicrous plagiarism, this show may be for you."
436,"I have never been more disappointed seeing so many ads in one tv show. It just doesn't fit, it feels forced and gross...."
437,"Putting the 80s nostalgia aside, I thought this show would be pretty bad, with annoying references to trends at that time or whatever
Surprisingly, I completely agree with this being Netflix's trademark show even if I don't think it's their best show ( bojack horseman still exists)
The duffer brothers manage to inject their own sense of style into this show whilst still containing a well developed plot with some really likeable characters
This show is flawed, don't get me wrong, but the good definitely outweighs the bad. Highly recommend it, especially because it's easily accessible on Netflix, and lets face everyone is using or owns an account"
438,"The Best show i have ever seen.
Season 1 amazing.
Season 2 better than season one but the lost Sister episode was terrible.
Season 3 was a bit wierd but was good and it had a brillant ending.
Overall the Best show ever."
439,"There were dark,moody atmosphere in season 1,where is it now?
16+ rating for what? There were no horror in season 3 in comparison to season 1.
Even courage the cowardly dog was more cryptic than stranger things s3..
Lots of extra cheesy characters like girlfriends which is interrupting the friendship of main four horsemen.
Where is the mystery?where is the suspense?
There only graphics in season 3..
No storytelling
Every move is predictable
No science ,no struggle in season 3
& It made me so angry that the boys are so busy with their gfs,they are not even fun anymore...
Why can't a show just stick to friendship & brotherhood,why adding unnecessary dialogue s like,men don't lie,but boyfriends? they do...
Why?
What is this? TLC?
disappointed after watching s3
Hope they bring the friendship & darkness back.."
440,So season 1 was definitely a 10. Hands down...great stuff. Season 2 suffered a bit from 1 but still pretty good. Solid 8. Season 3? A 2 or 3 star at best. This review has nothing to do with the actors. They are all great. The story and writing has gotten terrible. I shudder to think how bad season 4 will be...
441,"Season one and two were really good. Love the 80's, and the series have some great characters. Season 3 tries to introduce more romance and sentimentality, the result is you wanna fast forward. Characters also make illogical decisions. And no home computers? In the 80's?!"
442,The first season was really good then the show becomes simple and mainstream.....worst than that in the 3rd season we had more chat about teenagers sexuality than anything else.... pathetic what a let down!.
443,"I love 80's films and thought ST1 was awesome, albeit the monster could have been done a tiny bit better. It was dark, had a deep sense of mystery and thriller all merged with 80's retro and Hopper was superb as the sheriff who instead of being obnoxious and disbelieving actually investigates these things and sees through the lies very quickly (mega relief when I watched it that this was the case). Now we are at ST3 and I feel they've lost that sense of mystery and wonder and what's going to happen next feeling. They've also changed the characters from being serious to kinda jokey comedy characters you'd see from Spy Kids. Hopper was having silly bouts of jealousy over his 'daughter whose not his daughter' seeing a boy who'd also saved her life previously. Then the arguments with Ryder seem childish all the way through the series. It's merged itself with cheesy poor 80's rather than stylish thriller 80's made for adults. I hope they sort this out come Season 4. Bring the adults back, the mystery and the seriousness and you'll have a 10/10 finale. Otherwise it will end on a 'meh could have been better 5'."
444,"S3 writing and cinematography misses the mark. Acting was super, but the writing is not the same. The story unraveled in S1 & S2. In S3, it feels like watching a show that was brought back after 15 years."
445,The duffer brothers single handedly ruined stranger things with that sorry excuse of a third season. BRUTAL !!!
446,"Two great seaons. Then a major deterioration into a B horror teenagers movie. A real shame. Stupid and embarrassing dialogues and charecters. Most of the time simply boring.The last episode with Eleven powers out and a separation of all and the ridiculous ""surprise/start of season 4"" wad an insult to the intelligence.Really sorry for a really bad writers."
447,The 1st series was so watchable and had such a great 80's feel which made it addictive. Second series has the 80's feel but overall storyline was flat at times few characters over played their parts. You had Nancy played a love struck innocent semi stuck up girl then uses her best friend to go to a party to sleep with her boyfriend Then after feeling guilty after her disappearance hooks up with another boy and sleeps with him in the second series. Not forgetting that she wanted to shoot Steve if he wouldn't get out the house. To me that is not her character I think 1st series should of been a lot longer . I feel like the producers have or are running out of ideas to keep show going for the fans.
448,"This show is practically perfect in every way. It's very true to the aesthetic, culture, look and feel of the 80's, the actors are excellent and perfectly cast, and it's sort of a juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated attributes. It manages to be a fantastic homage to the pop culture of the era while at the the same time being altogether refreshing and new. One of the best series ever."
449,"Entertaining to say the least and definitely a nice nostalgic trip back into the 80s. However, the show remains full of plot holes and a good part of it feels 'forced' and 'shaky'. While i binge-watched the show, it felt underwhelming and overacted. Season 1 was better, whereas this one let me down in hard to define ways (conclusion, useless scenes and jokes, poor character development, etc). Also, i really felt the need to give it a 7 star rating. IMDb was by go to reference but it seems that every new show nowadays always gets either a 10 or a 1. Too polarized. This show is DEFINITELY not a 9 or 10, and I would place it somewhere between 7 and 7.5, maybe."
450,"Smoking, smoking and oh, there is some smoking with some alien and supernatural stuff mixed in. My wife enjoys it and says everyone at work is talking about it. She doesn't like Sci- Fi. I find it boring, annoying and about as interesting as a freshly baked lawn turd. I love Sci-Fi... but this misses the mark by a wide margin for me. Oh well.Thumbs up only for the 80's music!"
451,"After a phenomenal first season, I feel Stranger Things has completely lost its edge; recycling the same ideas we've seen on TV a million times before. First, I thought this season was a complete recycle of an episode of Fringe I saw a couple of years back, called: Alone in the World; Fringe was an American science fiction television series that ran from 2008-2013. In this episode, the Fringe team discover a large fungal network in a service tunnel which is actually part of a superorganism that functioned like the Shadow Monster. The infection also psychically connects to a young boy (named Aaron), who discovered the phenomenon, and if the Fringe team try to kill the organism, Aaron dies too. The Fringe team also finds that the organism is growing rapidly; creating its own ecosystem with tentacles and death spores for defence. Sound familiar? Google it. Furthermore, Joyce, Johnathan and Nancy make Will's body inhabitable to the Shadow Monster by increasing the temperature, because the monster likes the cold, which is identical to something I saw a season or two ago in Supernatural, in an episode called: The Things They Carried. Even, Elevens adventures this season could have been taken straight out of the pages of the Firestarter miniseries; based on Charlie McGee, a young girl with psychokinetic powers. I am sure Eleven is based on the character Charlie McGee, however, at least try to bring us an original story. To spite a weak second season, I'll still be watching the third. Hopefully, the writers can get us back on track and bring us something we haven't seen before on either X-Files or Fringe. Otherwise, I'll be checking out for the fourth. It's a real shame too, the second season of Stranger Things had such huge potential but they went in completely the wrong direction. Season 1: 9/10. Season 2: 4.5/10."
452,"Stranger Things is nothing more than Cut - copy & paste TV series. Cast is decent ..makeups are good but direction and story are too bad.So called inspiration from various sources just feel like you are watching Steven Spielberg + John Carpenter + Stephen King's movies at the same time. which is not very pleasant experience. The story revolve around a lost child and their friends and family trying to find him.I can't go into great detail because there are so many flaws in direction and story that its not possible to explain all of them here. But they says that ""even a good cast cannot save a bad story"". Even though there are plenty of thrilling and exciting moments but they don't make much sense as don't understand the story and whats going on.Seems like directors were confused and they are trying to make viewer even more confused.Folks just do a favor please done make a season 2 of this series.Thanks Best of Luck"
453,"Stranger Things but season 3 ruined the show
The reasons in no particular order:1. The red scare: the russians' plot felt contrapted, it's inconceivable that the USSR was able to build a whole underground military base in the middle of indiana where the US government had a secret base as well. Also they portrayed the Russians as one dimensional villains. Also highly trained soldiers were constantly beaten by a fat cop (doesn't add up). I may have given them a break on this if they were involved in s1 or s2 and this was a continuation, but out of the blue in season 3 they just show up.2. Product placement (cocacola, marlboro, eggo's, etc) was excessive. There is a whole scene just about how awesome is cocacola in ep7!3. All the ""suspense"" scenes weren't exciting at all. We knew that nothing bad will happen to any of the main characters no matter who they are facing. They all had plot armors4. The main villain is a one dimensional lumpy monster with no particular plan or purpose, just roaring and stuff5. All the talk between kids about capitalism, socialism and communism was out of character and cringeworthy. Please don't go into politics.6. There was no character development through out the season, no real plot or story.7. Puberty: self explanatory8. Too much music in scenes that didn't need any (that's my personal preference).All in all S1: 8.9/10 S2: 7/10 S3: 5.8/10"
454,"This series really has nothing unique or special, just repeated SCI-Fi plots without any meaning and very bad performance by actress Millie Bobby Brown with very overrated critics."
455,"I likely would not have enjoyed this series as much if not for the Duffer Brothers' choice to set it in the early 80s. It had every bit of the feel of an early Stephen King, produced by Steven Spielberg, directed by Joe Dante. There are some who feel that the subplot with the boys is reminiscent of The Goonies. I completely disagree. It felt like The Explorers (1985).The acting was solid. Ryder and Harbour carried the day, but Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, and Caleb McLaughlin really did an incredible job. Young people should not be this talented! I can't wait to see them elsewhere.There were very few errors in setting (one minor error in the sound track). Even little details like the wicker back on the chairs pulled me back.The eerie feel of being in the woods and the electrical problems around town really contributed to a dark feeling. I didn't feel like this was horror, more like it was suspense.The one flaw in the show was the monster. Show-not-tell should have prevailed until the very last episode. Then a bit more imagination would have been warranted.I can't wait for a season 2, though I'd be more than happy with them leaving this plot and going elsewhere."
456,"I usually do not commit myself to any serial because experience tells me that most of the serials, specially the American ones (compared to British serials not Indians!!!), tend to extend the episodes unnecessarily. They start with exciting beginning seasons and becomes dull or absurd with time. That's why I watch serials that are out a while ago and those having a definite end in sight and those which are highly recommended. Stranger Things has all three of these and so I started and finished watching this with utter disappointment. I have pointed out some of my sources of disappointment below, there are more, but I am not willing to spend any more time on this:1. The storyline is a cliché, may be it would have been a good storyline (though I doubt) if it originally were made in the '80s. Controlling things with mind, aliens, secret government experiments are all so things of the past in the entertainment world. 2. Acting was horrible and full of overacting. I particularly hated the acting of Winona Ryder. 3. Trying to sell tragedy so hard. Chief Hopper's dead daughter, Joyce's broken family and finally death of Eleven gives me the feel of watching something oriental. On the other hand, poor Barbara's family does not seem to have any concern for their daughter or whatever she was. 4. It does not make sense why the Government tried to sell a staffed doll as a dead body rather than just terming it a lost case and again no one bothered about missing Barbara the same way as they did about Will. 5. Three teenage kid managed to handle the monster with relative ease whereas the well-armed government agents are decimated by the same thing does not make any sense or reminds me of bullshit movie plots. 6. And many more. Finally, I started watching the series with higher expectation because of its high recommendation and because I expected better from a Netflix series, and this did not help either."
457,"Firstly, I feel I need to give you a disclaimer and tell you that I'm a big fan of most of Spielberg movies, so I could be biased. JJ Abrams' Super8 didn't blow me away and this definitely has the same DNA, and this is really good. The story, the soundtrack to the amazing child actors, all so good, especially Millie Bobby Brown who is incredible as Eleven. I must be hooked because I watched all the episodes in one go and I've got to go to work early tomorrow. All actors involved put in genre perfect performances, and it was nice seeing Winona Ryder in a major acting role again, although I think of Heathers whenever she's on screen, but that's just me. The only downside, if I had to choose one, is the monster effects aren't blockbuster movie quality, Hopefully, they'll be better in season 2 and it can't come soon enough. All credit to Netflix, they really seem to know what they're doing."
458,"Let's set The Twilight Zone, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Maverick, Quantum Leap, Seinfeld, and Breaking Bad to one side a moment. These were shows that were great not only for their brilliant writing and production value but also for their originality. They either created, defined or redefined a genre. Stranger Things is another thing entirely. Another, completely NEW thing which is, in itself, original.But I doubt this will ignite an entire genre, and this is why I consider it unique and incomparable to traditionally groundbreaking shows. Stranger Things is retro. This is obvious and has been noted by everyone. But I don't know if many people have noticed the ASTONISHING attention to detail. Lots of shows are set in history. And lots of shows do a good job of it. But Stranger Things is perfect. It's perfect, not in that it is a perfect reflection of the 80s. It does a damn good job of that. But it goes several steps further. Stranger Things also captures the cinematic style of the 80s. And it does it with such acute accuracy that it is truly mind blowing for a writer and filmmaker who grew up on 80s cinema and was primarily influenced by it as a child. (Me). I'd like to take a moment to specifically note the props. When I was a boy in the 80s, that was the furniture we actually owned. It is perfect in every detail. The girl's room could have been my sister's room. My sister literally had that exact music box with the ballerina in it. Furthermore, the show draws attention to brands that were popular in the 80s. This adds a touch of authenticity. Sure. But what is so brilliant about this is that it's done in the kind of obvious way that 80s movies did it. I'd also like to address the brilliance of the casting. I realized something about attraction many years ago. There is traditional look, there are unique looks, and there are fashionable looks. In every major era of cinema, there are particular ""types"" that the industry, for whatever reason, tends to like to cast. The 80s had an extreme version of this. And almost everyone in this cast is straight out of 80s casting. (Winona Ryder is an exception. I actually love Winona Ryder, but I think casting her in this was a mistake). The daughter is a great example of this. She reminds me of the actress from The Great Outdoors Lucy Deakins (I just looked that up) and several other actresses from the era. I honestly don't understand how these filmmakers are getting these performances out of these actors. My guess (and this really is just a guess) is that much of this was casting. I think probably the actors they chose, not only were perfect because they fit the 80s look, but also because they fit the 80s style of acting. Much of acting is exploiting natural quirks in your real character, and my guess is that many of these actors all had a natural tendency to be this way. Tendencies that might not be particularly charming in a typical 2016 project, but that are perfect for this. The filmmakers may also have had them watch 80s performances to try to emulate. Either way, credit needs to be given to the filmmakers for this. But the writing is where it all begins. The foundation of it all. Here's why I'm so impressed with the writing. They didn't just include a lot of good 80s stuff, they included 80s clichés. And not even good clichés. They added clichés that are kind of lame like completely senseless character motivations that we're just supposed to buy because it's movie logic. This show really steeps itself in movie logic and I LOVE IT. I usually hate this but, in this case, it's a beautiful homage to 80s films. And what really works for me is that they do it with a real reverence. Any time they include movie logic, the do it with the same straight face as was done in the 80s. There is no tongue in cheek; it's a perfect mimeograph. There are so many little touches. Kids-on-bikes being a signature of 80s cinema, especially with Spielberg. A lot of this seems to be very Spielbergian, but there are so many 80s films that this project draws from that I wouldn't define the influence so narrowly. As a writer and filmmaker myself, I can't help but watch, jaw open, astonished and mesmerized by this project. It's truly incomparable to other films or television projects. It's something entirely new and different, and I think it will stand apart for a very long time. I've never seen this level of accuracy in the depiction of an era, and I lived through the era. And maybe that's why it's so compelling to me. The first 10 years of my life were 1980-1990 and, in many ways, those are the most important year of one's life. It's one's introduction to the world, to one's self, to sights and sounds and smells, music, food, entertainment, etc. I don't think about the 80s all that much. I didn't love it. But I can tell you, there are things about my childhood that I haven't thought about for years, that this show has drawn back into the forefront of my mind. Wonderful things. And something makes me think that, maybe, our world is a little more synthetic today. Somehow the world was more ""real"" back then. I don't tend to buy into this idea that everything was better before smartphones, but... maybe some things were better. I don't know. I suppose, love it or hate it, this show has made this viewer think about some things, and that's one of the most important things great art can do."
459,"This is a very bad show. The only way Im thinking people like this,is only if they are teens or so much younger than even that. Is not a good show for anyone who is over 22. There are some good parts, but the show has bad graphics and stupid children lines and the girl is just awful. Nothing is believable about it and everything is predictable . Don't watch it if u are over 22.U will love it if u are a teen or younger.I will definitely not watch season 2. P.s. don't get yourself fooled by the high IMDb note, i bet only teens voted most of that. The only good actor there is the mother and she is great for sure. Maybe if there were older kids, at least 18 or so, the show would have been great."
460,"All reviews from the first seasons are pretty accurate. However, it's really a shame how they couldn't manage to recreate a similar atmosphere in season 2. It really tried to be bigger than it is, more nostalgic than it could be and although actors were not bad at all, their characters were no more believable or relatable than olive oil on a sundae.Season 2 was in the money business and that's it."
461,"This show was the highest caliber production I've ever seen, the only show that could possibly come close in quality is Game of Thrones. Netfix have played an absolute blinder. It feels like a long Spielberg movie.Stranger things has a phenomenal cast, especially the child actors. Its the best Netflix original by a long way. Eleven and Hopper are the stand out characters for me, both of them are going to go very very far in their careers. Winona Ryder was as always top notch. The bond between the child actors was visible and reading up on it, the Duffer Brothers worked hard on them becoming friends before-hand, which adds to the over all effect. I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of this, its mind-blowingly good and the sound track is 10/10. WELL DONE NETFLIX. LOVE/LOVE/LOVE."
462,"Stranger things starts off strong with its moody cinematography and nostalgic references to 1980 pop culture. After about the 5'th episode the story, acting, visuals kind of get bland. I also noticed an increasing amount of plot holes as if the writers were running out of ideas on how to tie it all together into 8 episodes, it just felt rushed near the end and really cheesy. I literally had to skip past several scenes because they were like nails on a chalk board (Spoiler Start *** where Mike was talking to El about how he wants her to live with him and his mom will be like her mom and they will be happy and yada yada, ignoring the fact that a disgusting demon monster with a venus flytrap for a head is in the room right next to them, then a few minutes later they continue on talking about ""after this is all over"", like umm hello? you are being stalked by a demon monster straight out of silent hill and you wanna talk about how she can eat ego waffles and other good food and sleep in her own bed. Way to sabotage your own scene by eliminating any remaining sense of suspense and horror. Spoiler End ***) I did enjoy the series for the most part and was mostly entertained so It deserves at least a 6/10, probably even 6.5. If season 2 carries on in the direction the first season was going then the the next thing heading into the upside down will be the positive ratings."
463,"Sorry, there is a difference between an homage and derivitive, repetetive, predictable boredom. I persisted with this until the end, misled by the hype/ratings, waiting and hoping it would improve. But it only gets worse the longer you watch. First season is the best by far - after that the writers have exhausted their capabilities and it runs out of puff."
464,"Even though I often find movies on IMDb overrated, I was expecting something good from this because of the 9.3. I am convinced that this is a case of the people rating something highly be cause it seems like it should be good. yes, its got lots of references from the 80s, but that does not mean its any good. We'll start with the worst dialogue ever. there were several places where the writings was so bad and you could actually see it straining to be funny. Worst in this department were the three screechy kids. One of them was a kind of hybrid character of GOONIES' Chunk, and Stand by Me's Vern. The chemistry between him and the black kid just missed the mark, the dead pan was never deadpan enough and the ""clever dialogue"" bits fell flat. although I' admit the other kid actually seemed to fit in the time and place being represented. Winona Ryder. She is so hit and miss. There are moments when she seems quite believable as the character but at other times ....just not. Worst though, might be the lack of originality, with ideas being stolen from all sorts of 80s titles. The 80s atmosphere felt less like the 80s and more like some a version of what a current have imagined it would be like from their distorted 2016 perception."
465,"Stranger Things season 2 surpassed the first season. I have to write something after reading several reviewers who said that the story is predictable and clichéd. What they don't understand is that is not important. The creators of Stranger Things know how to tell a good story, they recognise that it comes from strong characters and that what gives a story richness is the strength of the characters in the first place and from there, their interaction, the story and plot is driven by the characters acting true to themselves. In a great story the plot may be predictable but that is for the very reason that as you come to know who the characters are you can see how they will act. Situations then become of great interest as you feel almost as if you are a part of the story, because in your mind you feel the characters are real and you place yourself alongside with them and 'live' the story with them. To call this cliché betrays a lack of empathy with the characters. This can come about if the characters are undeveloped and remote. But in a story such as Stranger Things the characters are consistently strong and believable and earn your empathy. This gives you faith to invest more of your attention to the drama, draws you into the story. It is clichéd because every great story has always done this. This is the essence of great story telling. What is important is whether or not a movie, book, TV series, piece of music has soul. If it comes from the right place then it can take you on a journey, a real journey of discovery into yourself just as the creator went on a journey into themselves to create it. Too much modern art and culture is calculated, from the intellect, it is empty. No matter how good the execution is it is still empty in the end and cannot leave a lasting impression. Stranger Things is destined to become a modern classic of the TV series genre. Needless to say it is also very well executed in all departments too, from the acting to the music, the cinematography, the direction. It has no pretensions, it is what it is and it is very very good! I want more entertainment like this and less like the last film i reviewed which was Blade Runner 2049 which i think is symptomatic of what is wrong with Hollywood. Over calculated and pretentious instead of just real and heartfelt. Stranger Things gets my highest rating a 9/10."
466,"Really? You now have children blaspheming? How low will the industry go? Spoiling a good series, I am nauseated by it!"
467,"SpoilerI thought this was going to be an original Netflix series, however I watched the first three episodes and they are just stealing ideas from E.T., Starman, Poltergeist, and Carrie. Surely, there can be some more creative ideas out there, can't there?I was waiting for the Titanic II to sail and sink in Lake Michigan, ha ha. Maybe that happens later in the series.On the other hand, my wife loves it and continues to watch it.I also noticed that the writer changed in Episode 3, but it didn't change the stealing of ideas."
468,"I've given it 1 star because I can't go lower than that. My friends are raving about it, they pushed me into watching. I watched season 1, just because I was a bit intrigued about the ending but boy, I was disappointed like never before. I thought maybe just maybe it is gonna be a super twist in the end, that's why the high rating, that's why my friends' love for it. I went on until episode 6 of season 2. OK, couple of first episodes started to attract me but then it fell over flat. Winona Ryder overacts and overacts. Children did good job though. I lost it when in episode 6 of season 2, Will Buyers tells his mother that he was sorry and ""he"" told Will to do that, she questions him, ""Who told you to do what?"" Sorry Joyce, but were you sleeping through the whole thing or wait the writers were sleeping perhaps because were they still trying to ascertain about Will's condition or they were still in doubt about the monsters. Also every time there is a report of certain monster or whatever, people dismiss that as if they hadn't seen or heard anything like that before as in season 1 before that. Just plain stupid and the sad part is that our collective intellectualism and smartness is going down rapidly."
469,"When Netflix showed me the trailer for this series, I immediately knew I was going to like it. I absolutely adored the movie Super 8, and this felt like a nod to that with a few variations.Stranger Things did not disappoint. From the very beginning, we were sucked into it with a tense opening scene that set the stage for what sort of series this was going to be. We're introduced to the characters one by one, in a way that makes us understand that each of them is going to eventually play a role in the outworking of the plot. I initially thought that Hopper was going to be a character that I disliked, but that wasn't the case. He was human and flawed, and I loved how his backstory was revealed little by little, up until the last episode, when we saw the culmination of what made him into the man that he was. I thought Winona Ryder did brilliantly as a strained, anxious, just-a-little-shy-of-emotionally-unstable mother of a lost child. And all of the kids were phenomenal in their roles, but I especially appreciated Millie Bobby Brown's performance as El/Eleven. She didn't have much dialogue, and most of her acting was done with her body language, her eyes, and her facial expressions, and it was absolutely brilliant.There were jump scares, which are to be expected in any movie of the thriller/horror genre, but I felt like they were tastefully done. The series wasn't saturated with them, and there was always a nice, tense buildup to them. The scenes with the monster in them were always delightfully terrifying, even the ones where you couldn't quite see yet what it looked like. I also loved the idea of an ""Upside Down"", and I thought it was neatly executed.I'm really hoping we get a second season of this, because there are so many questions I have that I'm hoping are answered. In the last scene of the last episode, we see quite a few of these unsolved mysteries: Will still being infected with whatever held him hostage in the Upside Down, the truth of Eleven's whereabouts after she kills the monster (also where that monster came from and whether or not there are other monsters out there), what happens to the Hawkins Laboratory and how will they deal with the open doors to the Upside Down, whether or not Terry will ever find out about her daughter, and most importantly, will Nancy stay with Steve or will she go with Jonathan? :) The one thing I felt could have been done differently was Barbara. I felt she got a raw deal, and I wish they had made her survive her time in the Upside Down, too. Other than that, I thought it was a great series, and I will definitely be watching it again in the near future."
470,"I love this show season 1 and 2 are gold.
I enjoy 3 but you can see the decline begin
Its worth a watch but I dont have much hope for 4."
471,"I was prepared to give this series a 10 until I saw season 3. Oh, my God, where do I start? So much illogical stuff, forced humor that didn't land well, evil Russians (yawn!) with no human characteristics whatsoever, who somehow built billions dollars worth huge underground building in USA and no one noticed, completely irrelevant characters with no reason to exist (like, for example, Dustin's girlfriend), plots that add nothing (fight between Mike and El, for example), characters turning into caricatures of themselves (it was apparent on Joyce and Jim, but also others), some characters almost left out (like Lukas and partially Mike), and some teenagers and children who beat up ""evil Russian army"" (yawn!)... armed with guns? Wth, are you serious? I loved season 1, season 2 was good too, a bit less but still great, but please, leave this whole stupid story out from season 4 or you will lose all fans. Seriously, people..."
472,"Stranger things season 1 was great. I could say season 2 also makes sense, but there was no justifiable logic behind the isolation of 11 by police chief. I just Cant cope up with season 3, what nonsense and time wasting! I'm in the chapter 3 for more than 2 months now tired with all of these unnecessary additional. Paranoid behavior of police chief, Pshyco romantic behavior of mike and 11, poor jokes. Is that we are paying you Netflix? The quality of the whole series drastically decreases with these nonsense. If we really want to see those kinda crap, we dont need netflix, any of 3rd class Hindi film will do that. Hope this story will be back to the line with next episodes, if not I will not give any damn for season 4. Why I have rate this 6 due to the poor stuff injected to series 3, otherwise this could be place for 8/9 rating easily."
473,"I am not one to binge TV shows, or even watch them to begin with, although, I LOVE movies. I am very stubborn with which TV shows I invest my time with. With that being said, Stranger Things is one of those few shows that I am so pleased with. I found the idea of the show so unique and imaginative. Im not usually one for Sci-Fi type content, however this was executed in such a way to appeal to my standards. One thing I thought was fascinating was the fact that shows start to decline as the seasons progress. Stranger Things proves anything is possible, as the seasons were just as consistent, if not better from season one to three! I still catch myself watching certain scenes on YouTube, enjoying them as if it's my first time. Im a sucker for some good emotion in any cinematography, I think its the icing on top. The finale of season three really filled that expectation for me, and then some! I really enjoyed this series and I am looking forward for what the cast and crew has in store for us in season 4."
474,It was a brilliant horror series. All charectors are very selective. Expecially Dustin I love him
475,"This show gets you hooked. It's so intriguing, so well done, it's has great acting, and it has great writers. One of my favorites."
476,"Season 1 was pretty damn great, unpredictable, interesting, great characters, awesome music. It was for the most part greatly written, acted and directed. Season 2 however, isn't as good. It was predictable, strangely boring at times and didn't innovate enough from the first season.It's like they got surprised by the success of the first season and suddenly was in a hurry to make season 2. That is what it feels like. And that's too bad, because this show was the biggest surprise in a long time. And it needs to deliver this sort of storytelling and originality in it's third season or it will be one of those TV shows that had a great first season, and then everything went downhill from there. Like ""Lost"" and ""Prison Break"" to just mention two out of maaaaany.Anyways, season 2 wasn't bad, but not really good either, it had it's moments for sure, but not as good as season 1. Season 2 starts off very well, but it's after episode 4 that it all falls apart and becomes incredibly predictable, sentimental and boring.I will change my score of this show for every season, as everyone should. As we are not voting on the pilot episode here, but the series as a whole, and that impression changes as episodes are releases.First season was a 9/10 for me. With season 2 the series currently stands at a 7/10. And i am only hoping for it to rise again, i want another great season like the first, i don't want a new prison break."
477,"I heard so much about the show so I decided to see if for myself and honestly I didn't like what I saw. I found it dull, boring and overacted. I don't get the appeal to this show."
478,Totally disapointing series too much superheroic and fictional
479,". . .and not just because I miss the 80s. Here's a little town with a big secret - and potentially a big problem. And, of course, the government is involved. A cult is developing for the show at my workplace, and everyone has his/her own descriptors for what it reminds them of. It's like a mashup of Stephen King, John Carpenter,James Patterson, David Lynch, X-Files, and more than a soupcon of Twilight Zone. The acting is amazing, especially the children's, but Winona Ryder and David Harbour are fabulous as the adult leads. The 80s vibe is authentic. I only wish Roddy McDowell was still here and able to be in it. I have my fingers crossed all the way up to the elbows that AMC renews it for another season. If you like sci-fi or paranormal, you have to see this show. You will believe.Wow, IMDb, do you know how hard it is to write 10 lines that contain no spoilers? If I didn't reallllllly want to promote the show, I'd have just eased on down the line."
480,"Thank you Netflix! Stranger Things to me is a masterpiece in so many ways. The directing, the acting, the setting, the feeling is spot on. All acting is above par with a roller-coaster of emotions mixed with drama, suspense, comedy and the overall mixture of the characters works well. Bringing the audience back to the 80's is an understatement, they do it perfect and it feels good. The ET/Goonies/X-Files environment this show carries to the audience is a total win. It makes me feel very special to watch a show of this high caliber. Oh yeah.. Excellent soundtrack for sure! 10 out of 10 and it deserves much more!I very much hope more seasons will be released, as I assume there will be. It is going to be very hard patiently waiting for more."
481,"Season 1 the kids did fantastic. Season2 their acting went downhill. I don't know what changed but it was unwatchable, the kids were so fake, so very disappointing . season 1 gets a 10 and season 2 gets a 2. How does Hollywood keep screwing things up! It's strange how Hollywood can screw up success ."
482,"But that's only one reason why I think this storytelling has worked. The cultural mash up gives something for parents to reminisce. But you also get to see your children gasp and grip in suspense, for the second time, in the very plot points and twists that you had enjoyed back then. The storytelling is done so masterfully that there's no sense of it all being a rip-off. It's intense viewing at times, and I found myself chuckle at myself about all that. There's some emotional stuff too for old romantics like me. We we're young once. You're allowed to be drawn in and invested in every relationship. You get to care about them, and there's nothing that leaves you wondering about what should or shouldn't have happened. That's satisfying viewing. The actors shine again in Season 2 and that's the polish on this production.Somehow I think the creators have managed to leave a cultural legacy for Gen X parents, so I tip my hat to them for that. My 13 and 12 year old we're not disappointed, and that counts for a lot of legacy if you think about it. Well done indeed."
483,"I was very curious to see Winona Rider in a TV series. I was actually pleasantly surprised. She hit kind of a slump after Edward Scissorhands (a classic); she honestly pulled out with this series. I also really enjoy the character Eleven very much. She is a really strong actress. What is most impressive is her use of her voice. She has a sort of smooth, naïve tone; yet, there is a lot hidden depth in her. If her character is pursued in later seasons, in some sort of exposé, I would very well be pleased. The character development with the characters Steve, Nancy, and Jonathan is also brilliant. All three I very much hated near the beginning; however, by the end of the season, I found myself content with them. I see this especially with Nancy, who seems to be a much more solid, strong lady by the end of the season. I couldn't find any plot holes at all. I do feel a slight uneasiness because of slight abruptness of Barb's appearance. I would have liked to have her around longer. By and large, an excellent endeavor."
484,"So happy I found this. A great classic sci-fi horror with some great done directing! The story is coherent, not like in the many many series and movies that come out these days and it is just a testimony to the classics that we love so much, without simply coping it,but adding it's own style and flavor. And where did you found those kids - amazing acting, absolutely amazing. It is one of the strongest points of this show, the young actors who really bring it to life. I am amazed how well do they do their job to immerse you in this terrifying but also innocent world. Great job to everybody that work on this show and thanks for the good time! Expecting the next season :)Highly recommend to everyone who is a fan of the genre or just likes something that is really good!"
485,"This show is unique and stands on its own. The setting (1983) was extremely well done and made people my age feel like it was their childhood again. It's good to see that out of all the same formula shows being put out there, and disappointing ""sci-fi"" shows (I'm looking at you Sense8) that something new and refreshing comes. I was hooked from the first episode and watched it for all 7ish hours straight. The kid actors do a fantastic job as do the adults. The ending is both satisfying and leaves plenty of questions (not in a bad way) that will easily lead to a second season. Absolutely terrific show, can't recommend highly enough."
486,"This show is very bad horror, it's never ever scary, it's like the Disney version of a scary show. The main psychic girl is very annoying and just unconvincingly screams alot with her hand up at plot hole filled monsters that are just homages to other things. The first seasons monster is just inter dimensional jaws, and the second seasons is just big cloud/shadow of a xenomorph. Nothing is original, most of the characters are annoying and the plot is just a side thought to countless 80s ""easter eggs"" and ""homages"" which translates to no original idea in here whatsoever"
487,The series should have ended in the first season. This is one of those stories that don't work well with sequels. Everything felt the same. Every crazy thing was already seen before. Going back to those unanswered questions and getting answers just felt corny and kind of ruined the mystery of past stories told in season one. I understand they don't want to drag the viewer too much but would be better to not even explain them. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed the second season overall and was still addictive to check out the next episode. But IMDb is showing 4 seasons total which means they're already confirmed. Which means they will be milking this cow until there's nothing left. Hence my rating.
488,"This series is more than just a itch scratcher for 1980s nostalgia, it's an almost perfect re-imagination of a genre not replicated since the 1980s; movie Super 8 looks clumsy and is boring compared to this excellent series. The characters look 80s, the casting itself is very 1980s, nerdy kids and their nerdy friends with bad 80's hair. The language and style of acting is also very 80s but it's more of a streamlined 1980s, the editing, direction and cinematography, lighting is better than your typical 80's Goonies or even ET I think. I must emphasize that this is a grown up version of the 80s ET type genre, people get shot in the head etc and teenage kids rendezvous in the toilets to make out etc so it's not that innocent comedic thread that runs right the way through ET for example although there are many moments like that particularly with the main group of protagonist kids. I must say that the costumes, sets and the props (BMX bikes, giant walkie talkies, HAM radio kits, 80s circular telephone dials, 80s style houses in small town America, big 80s American cars etc go a long way to making this look authentic. What can I say, this is truly excellent and everyone involved should be proud of themselves. In some ways this is the ultimate love letter to Steven Spielberg, it's a labour of love and just doesn't it show it...."
489,"I really like the show, but the third season got very controversial. Certain details are still great: actors (my love to Gaten, Ms. Ryder, and Mr. Harbour as well as the rest of the cast), movie quotes, visual effects, music, dialogs, especially in Russian!God, proper Russian texts and phrases are still so rare in American movies and TV shows, but here, instead of Cyrillic rubbish like DIFVJASDVAS (hello, ""Altered Carbon""), we can read and hear proper Russian, which is really cool. My respect to one who wrote the dialog between Dr. Smirnov and Mr. Murray with the iconic phrase ""Who said you had to be an American to join the fun?"" and the conversation about the essence of America through the example of funfair rigged games. Self-irony is always worth the deepest respect.But when you look at the Season 3 globally... guys, with all due respect, what the hell was that? First, you sell the same stuff for the third time - not cool. Second, it's really strange for Soviet military forces to be smart enough to trick all the American special services for infiltrating into the very heart of the Mid-West, but dumb enough to let some ordinary kids walk in, play monkeys real hard and run out whenever they want. Third... Nah, those two are good enough to give only 6 stars - but only for the Season 3.I really hope that the Season 4 will be as entertaining, but without those global stupid things, please. I know this is not a documentary, but it can be a little bit more realistic and smart, since it's a nerd story. :)))"
490,"Stranger Things Season 1 was virtual perfection, an authentic period piece and classic callback to 80s with music and homages to movies like ET, The Goonies, The Boy Who Could Fly, The Karate Kid, Close Encounters. Geeky kids, loners, outsiders, bullies, goofy parents, apathetic cops, but with a few characters defying the clichés, in particular Joyce, Hopper and Steve. Tons of humor and heart and perfect cast chemistry. In particular, Millie Bobbie Brown was a sheer revelation as Eleven, brilliantly creating one of the best TV characters ever. Also, Matthew Modine was exceptionally malevolent as the mercurial Brenner. One of the most original offerings Netflix ever produced.Season 2 comes along and pretty much more of the same, a super-entertaining overall subplot and all of our original characters bringing with this time, Noah Schnapp stealing the show as Will. Also, a couple of strong new characters in the form of Bob and Billy. BUT also, there was a dubious addition with the completely irrelevant and unnecessary character Max, who added absolutely nothing to the story. She was just a hanger-on with no chemistry with any of the cast and pretty poorly acted as well, yet fans are obsessed with this incredibly forced, awkward character. So unfortunately, she gets to stay. Also, the lack of Brenner was ever apparent as the villain was this time more of an unseen monster, the Mind Flayer.In comes Season 3 and NOW the show is really starting to lose me. I think the first 2 or 3 episodes of this season may be among the worst of the series. The premiere was AWFUL. I don't think Seasons 1 or 2 had even 2 bad episodes in succession and Season 3 had like THREE of them right out of the gate! Characters acting out of character, unfunny dialogue, constant yelling, camera mugging, awkward conversations about sex and teen hormones, relationship melodrama. Stranger Things is turning into a CW show! Episode 4 gets the plot actually moving, but it was mostly style and very little substance. Max is as irrelevant as ever, there just to give Mike headaches and turn El into a raging feminist. With the exeption of El, there is virtually no development for any of the main 6 characters (unfortunately, I have to include Max since the writers are hellbent on forcing her as one of the gang). Mike has degenerated into a raving lunatic that yells at everyone, Lucas is nothing more than the muscle, Will is just there, Dustin is completely separated from the group, and last and definitely least Max just frowns all the time and has all the personality of a snail.Then there's the newcomers. Lucas' little sister Erica gets an expanded role and goes from funny comic relief to obnoxious main character. Also the writers introduce this new girl Robin, who works with Steve at the mall, and she reeks of deus ex machina writing. By a miracle, she speaks a handful of languages and is willing to go all in on a dangerous adventure with a guy she apparently can't stand and a kid she just met. She also had a ton of dialogue that I felt went absolutely nowhere. It was all fluff. Counter that with a still-relevant and great character like Eleven who barely says a word and conveys 100 times the emotion of a babbler like Robin.The real standout in Season 3 was Dacre Montgomery as Billy, along with some other great additions like Cary Elwes as the Mayor and that Russian scientist guy Alexei who reluctantly teamed up with Joyce and Hopper. Speaking of Hopper, by Season 3, he turned into a clownish buffoon who apparently caught the same yelling disease that Mike was afflicted with. Joyce yelled all the time, too, but at least she was always like that. While the plot finally got somewhat entertaining the last half of the season, I couldn't help but feel all the characterizations of the main cast got completely lost in the shuffle.And the Russian subplot was silly. Their underground facility looked so cheap compared to the elaborate mall constructed above it. And that Russian general, the Terminator wannabe, and all of the lackeys in the subterranean compound were just filler the entire season as the Mind Flayer was always the real threat. Even with the Flayer, it always felt like there were no stakes as the monster spent most of it's time growling and staring instead of actually just killing it's targets. In Season 2, I remember being genuinely afraid for characters' lives. In Season 3, I had no such feeling.
Sadly, I think this show has flamed out already. The initial positive reception to Season 3 is already losing steam as people are seeing through the showrunners' crap. We aren't buying it anymore."
491,"This show is created entirely for, about and, if would seem, by 12-year-olds. If you are in that demographic, you should find it quite enjoyable."
492,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Stranger Things because I don't really know anything about the source material. I've watched a few episodes (I'm trying to pace myself) but I can confidently say that I'm hooked, I've got to have more Stranger Things. These characters are wonderful and engrossing. Winona Ryder & David Harbour really do such a good job in this and I know working with very young actors must be challenging but these kids really bring it! I especially like how normal these characters look even though they are engrossed in such a surreal situation. This is what real sci-fi should be about. Netflix, I keep trying to find a reason to end my subscription with you but I just can't find a single one (smile!)."
493,"The Goonies meets the X-Files with an 80s soundtrack. Love it! When I first saw the ratings for this movie, I didn't know what to expect. I can't remember the last time I saw a 9.2 for anything on IMDb. It's fair to say that I was slightly sceptical.I thought, anything with a 9.2 has to at least be worth a watch. I was not disappointed. Not only was it worth watching, but I now realise why it has a 9.2.My rating is 10 out of 10, simply because I have not seen a series in this genre that has been it's equal in the past 10 years. It really was that good. They knocked this one out of the park.Would I like to see a second series? Not really, I think it finished really well. I will however be waiting with great anticipation for the next project the Duffer Brothers take on.I also have to mention the actors and actresses involved in this project, especially the child actors, really terrific job. They really brought this to life and sucked you into the whole story.Extremely impressed and to anyone who is thinking of watching it, I would definitely suggest giving it a try."
494,"This show isn't bad. It has its moments, but I personally just think it's incredibly unoriginal and overrated for what it is. The majority of people I've talked to who love it seem to think that just because you make something that rides on nostalgia, it's automatically a masterpiece. A lot of it's just really nerdy and seems to copy ideas from earlier shows and films, EG Firestarter, Eerie Indiana, Super 8, The Goonies, Stand By Me, stuff like that. And it's very predictable, too. The characters are certainly likable and fun, but at the same time it's just a bunch of tropes we've all seen before in one form or another. There's a lot of CGI that really doesn't suit the 80's motif that they're going for. It often feels like they're just throwing together whatever ideas come to mind that they've already seen somewhere else, and while copying older ideas isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just makes Stranger Things come off as some sort of parody more than anything else.That being said, it does have some truly emotional and well-done moments, and it's worth watching just for that alone. And how could I hate a show that encourages kids to read real printed books and play around with old film and music formats instead of cell phones and iPads? Love it or loathe it, I think Stranger Things is here to stay for the time being, and its fan base is always growing larger."
495,"About Stranger Things, I looked forward to this series. But as my rating suggests, it did not delver.First let me say I am no longer young. Second, I am not so old that I need a film to be explained to me. But I simply did not understand much of what was going on in the final three episodes.More important however was that the characters never seemed to act like real people. Particularly the adults. case in point, one mother and father in the series never go into their son's room - not once. If they had they'd have discovered with whom he'd been sharing that space and well, that would ruin the story. So, I understand the 'why', but I think it could have been handled lots better.As for the kids' acting; really terrible.Finally, if there was one more scene of the kids jumping onto their bikes I would have screamed. In fact, I did."
496,"Unless you are a big '80s nostalgic or a child, forget about it. It has a good plot, but it is poorly explored by the direction. Everything is predictable: the dialogues, the scenes, who is gonna die and who is gonna live. About dying, there is a ""rule"" in US movies where kid can't die. The series is runned by kids. Guess what? No matter how big the trouble they face, you know they will be alright. So you simply don't care about the action.
In this 3rd season, the '80 references have dropped a lot, so it's almost a waste of time. Kudos for Priah Ferguson and Brett Gelman, the saviours of this season.
One funny note: Netflix is famous for supporting LGBT, feminism and stuff, but can't tolerate older guys chilling together in a sauna. It makes them ""throw up"", as Lucas cstates in S03E04."
497,"We were glad season 3 was only 8 episodes. The mall was a big 80s feature but so much of this was already done. Russians are the bad guys and were just silly. Multiple gay characters which did not happen in the 80s and the uber annoying singing of The Neverending Story that ended up resulting in the appearance of a main characters death (though we get a sign that isn't the case at the end). Also one of the most interesting characters that might have been great to incorporate in the future now that he has a glimmer of redemption, Billy, was just killed off terribly.They also had a ton of errors like bright red M&Ms and other things that were glaringly inaccurate. The story was disjointed, really 3 stories until the end and none of them were particularly compelling.Most interesting will be if they finally make Eleven the bad guy. Also totally ignored the introduction of the other special talent group we saw in season 2."
498,"It started well, with an intriguing 1st season. Unfortunately, it has turned into a teen romance."
499,"As expected, true to his '80s nostalgia nature, the second season of ""Stranger Things"" takes the sequel path - and it does so in the best possible way: it's definitely in the alley of ""Empire Strikes Back"" or ""Aliens"" rather than the trite ""more of the same"" approach.The story builds on the previous installment as we find the characters where we left them at the end of the last season. The attention to details, the '80s feeling, the references - that were the trademark of season 1 - are all still there while the character driven narrative moves forward.The idea of splitting the main characters is a risk that pays off, giving each character room to breath and to grow on their own. The newbies also work, although a couple of them aren't as focused as they could've been.The story is cohesive and well told, a little darker in places and a little more action-y at times (but not to the point of becoming pointless or annoying) - and it manages to be perfectly self-contained, while still planting enough seeds for future seasons to grow around.The usual amount of references and homages (with several new ones throw in the mix) prevent it from be really innovative or deeply creative, but that's not a bad thing, here, and the material is very well executed.Great cast all around, strong performances - although, someone must've told young Finn Wolfhard that he was one of the best actor from the previous season as he tries to overdo himself, here, sometimes going a bit overboard (and, at times, it feels like he's using his character to audition for a young Kylo Ren in the Star Wars franchise). Nothing major, though, and it doesn't subtract from the enjoyment.All in all, the numerous 10 stars it's getting are definitely over- rating, but it's a solid, well rounded 8/10 experience."
500,"With all the hype about ""Stranger Things"" and with so many friends and colleagues watching it, I came about and had to watch it as well. And sat down to watch all episodes of the first season on two evenings.While ""Stranger Things"" certainly is entertaining, it is not all that Regardless, it should be said that ""Stranger Things"" is entertaining, and the storyline is well-thought through and equally so executed on the screen at the hands of directors Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer. They managed to build up a good continuation of the story and fair level of mystery.However, there were aspects of the series that didn't really appeal all that well to me. For example, the whole thing with the strange girl good as the hype had it made up to be. Perhaps this was because I was expecting something more grand from the series, giving all the hype.known as ""11"". Sure, she was vital to the storyline, but personally I didn't care much for her story and her contribution to it. Mind you, that I am not saying that Millie Bobby Brown didn't act well, because she most certainly did.And while we are on the topic of actors, then it should be said that they had managed to get to get a great ensemble of acting talents, both familiar and new faces. And they all contributed quite well to the series. I especially enjoyed Winona Ryder (playing Joyce Byers) and David Harbour (playing Jim Hopper).The effects in ""Stranger Things"" were good, and used in fair moderation. Personally I think it was a bit of a shame that they held back with the special effects, because it would have spiced up the show so much more.The creature was nicely made and had some good design. But it was just too easily defeated in my opinion, which was somewhat of an anti-climatic moment.There is certainly a good amount of H.P. Lovecraft and Spielberg influence behind the construction of ""Stranger Things"" and it reflects on the screen.It was a great treat to witness the amount of effort they had gone through to make the magic of the 1980s come back to life. And they did that quite successfully. And as a fan of the Dungeons & Dragons game, it was a wonderful treat with the element of D&D shown in ""Stranger Things"".""Stranger Things"" was entertaining enough, but I felt sort of disappointed, because I had initially expecting something much more grand and memorable. But still, it was fun to watch. And as such, I am rating ""Stranger Things"" six out of ten stars; based on what I have seen in season one only."
501,"Last season was so bad it killed the memory of first season, first with got and now this."
502,"I wholeheartedly believe this is one of the best TV shows in recent years - maybe even of the decade. Season 1 felt more like a long, drawn out, excellent movie than an ordinary series, and this can be attributed to many reasons.Visually, ""Stranger Things"" is stunning. The production value and cinematography are the best, unlike any other I'd ever seen in a TV show. Normally the contrast of visuals between a show and a movie is clearly apparent - usually because of budget and staff - but such is not the case here; one could play an episode marked as part of a movie and no one would be the wiser. There's also of course, the 80s homage feel that is conspicuously displayed in most of the scenes. To many, it serves as an item of nostalgia or a reminiscence of similar classic 80s movies.But even though 'the 80s feeling' seems to be the focus of many people when watching the show, I sense that they forget to look at the other aspects that makes ""Stranger Things"" great. One of those aspects is the characters. All of them play some part or role in the movie, and they all have profound personalities. As the story progresses each of the sets of characters make their own developments to solving the conflict, and the way they were able to eventually intertwine their efforts was a satisfying inclusion. Even the child actors were able to pull off very convincing and pretty strong characters.This is a show that can easily have you finding yourself suspend disbelief and feel the story come to life, despite the very otherworldly premise. It's funny how greatly it makes you long for a misadventure with your friends as kids. Overall, the way the sequence of events build up, the way the plot unravels to the impending climax, the way the mysteries keep you glued to the screen, the way the magical soundtrack takes you back in time and the way the experience finally comes to a powerful conclusion and wraps up in a fashion that very few TV shows can imitate, makes ""Stranger Things"" an evoking installment that perhaps only good movies are."
503,"I really liked the first season it was incredible also season two just entertaining but three!!!
oh my god wish you just ended up by season two and never released 3.
I hate the ending. Ell loses her power! Then hopper dies cause joyce had to kill him to save the world!! Couldn't wait for him to just get back for 10 seconds at least. I have so many regrets that I have wasted my time on it.
And what the story of that lesbian girl ?
I think that part was really unnecessary at all"
504,"First season obvious 10/10.
Honestly. This is the best Netflix has to offer.
Second season 8/10.
Still great but it did drop in quality. Ends VERY similar to season one."
505,"Everything about this series is excellent. Cast, screen writing, the period piece, soundtrack, acting; its all amazing.David Harbour is beyond amazing. He should get nominated for a Golden Globe for his role as the Chief. Winona Ryder is excellent. Loved they are acting again together. Previous was in The Iceman (2012) which if you haven't seen is excellent.This series by the Duffer Brothers developed the characters beyond anything I can recall seeing recently. Every character is likable or not and its because you know something about them. Right down to the boys science teacher.Matthew Modine is extremely good as the federal agent. I can't recall a role he's done that I didn't like. Please have an open mind with this series and watch it. Rewatch any unfinished episodes. Netflix Original nailed it yet again. Excellent."
506,"For three episodes I tried and tried to like this ... But to keep a mystery like this going you have to have interesting characters ... And NONE of these were ... And they ain't pretty either ... Poor old Winona Ryder looks rough as hell in a cast that either looks inbred or suffering from an eating disorder !!! ... So along with a bad cast, well, nothing of interest happens In fact nothing much of anything happens ... A series of cliche's ( rather than the reworking of 80s tropes as the makers would try to have you believe ) plod out on the screen in an increasingly less interesting manner ... Visually it is tired and uninventive ... I gave it 2 and a half hours of my life and all this mediocre fluff has proved to me is that I have a lot better things to do with it than bother wasting another 5 finding out where this clunker is going"
507,"second season is just horrible.and too many jump scares.. the first season was really good but the second is really nothing like the first. seems like a usual thing with Netflix.for an example, daredevil was GREAT. but the second season was forced, boring and repetitive. same with ""Stranger things"".."
508,"SPOILERS BRUH -------------When this movie isn't beating it's story line over your head with a bat (4 of the 8 episodes are carbon copies of the kids riding bikes, the girl mashing things with her brain, and the kid communicating with his shrieking mother via electricity), it engages in a mountain of Fan Service, usurped only by this years Star Wars (worst of the 7 made so far, not even close).Much like other Netflix series Orange is the New Black and Love, you either have no care about the characters (the kid is kidnapped in the first scene. there's no connection), or you straight up dislike them.Garbage Level: Dumpster Fire"
509,"This is a show about akward kids and teens and annoying unlikable adults filled with CGI effects. The worst is that dumbass sheriff Hopper. Wyona Ryder excells in making exagerated face distorsions. Some scenes were so freaking annoying that I skipped them! Calling this a horror movie is a disgrace, unless you consider disgust beeing horror! I am most probably too old for this. Ooh and the bad, ugly, brutal Russians - what a cliché! Please spare us with a fourth season of this BS. Well I have 2 and a half more episodes to go, but I don't see any sense or purpose in doing this show (except for hitting the right audience and with that money, lol).
Really don't get the hype about this serial, 1. Season was great, 2. Season so so, 3. Season is just see above! Get new writers!"
510,"I liked the first season a lot. The second season though has a bad after taste of sequel.The first three episodes are great; we catch up with all the characters and get some backstory what happened to Eleven. Also new characters are introduced and the new plot is established. It is slow but not too slow. Then in the middle three episodes it gets really slow out of sudden. It seems to lead nowhere. Some of the B-arcs are nice, but the plot gets lost and we even get more backstory. Sometimes a McGuffin should stay a McGuffin. And sometimes loose ends should stay loose ends.These middle episodes live more from the B-arc than the actual still underdeveloped plot. In addition, our characters are most of the time split up and the Goonies feeling is lost, which is the biggest mistake of this season.This was an attempt at character building which the writers are no very good at. Character development happens in movie terms through conflict in the first season and the attempt to develop the characters through interaction this season instead fails. What happens around the characters is more interesting than what happens with the characters in this part of the season. They creators and not playing to the strength of their show but instead emphasize its weaknesses.Later we get some character development of Eleven. Just to flip her quickly 180 degree around, so she actual plays a role in this season and will be the Deux Ex Machina in the end. Nevertheless, her character still feels underdeveloped and more like a plot device.These episodes are quite forgettable and feel like padded run-time, though they have some nice scenes but do not have enough substance to make up three episodes.When the characters are united again in the last three episodes, the Goonies feeling that made the first season so great is back, and the show shines again. Finally, we get a rushed conclusion with the expected Deus Ex Machina featuring Eleven. However, it leaves you unsatisfied, but is followed up by an epilogue that makes up for the uninspired finale.Though the sloppy writing to rip of Yoda/Luke on Dagobah, The Exorcist, The Mercury puzzle and some more movies throughout the season are almost cringe worthy and feel just wrong. Some more creative solutions to come to a similar conclusion would have benefited this season a lot.This is a good second season but this has sequel written all over it. It is less original; the plot is not very well developed and the pacing is wrong (ok at the start, too slow in the middle, too fast at the end).The acting and production value overall is top notch for a TV show. Same goes for the writing in regards to the dialogue. However, character development often feels forced and the plot is quite thin.After all, it feels more like half a season padded with procedural episodes instead of a highly serialized show. Throughout binge watching, I had the feeling they took out ideas just to have enough content for a third season instead of leaving it in the second season. In addition, some elements (e.g. Eleven's ""sister"") feels slapped on just to have loose ends that can be referenced in a third season or even built one around it.If you liked the 1st season, you will like the second one as well. The creators delivered for sure, but the whole season has stamped sequel over it all along, and shows the inexperience in running a show over multiple seasons as well a a serious deficit in creating a plot that can sustain a whole season.I give the second season a 6 out of 10 on average (7 for the 1st three, 5 for the middle three and 6 for the last three episodes), whereas the first season was a strong 8 on average for me."
511,"Damn, what an awesome season once again, i loved every minute of it, BUT that little black girl was the worst thing i saw in a series in a LONG time. awful casting, maximum cringe dialog. she was just there to destroy the atmosphere and my mood. god awful."
512,"Season 3 was boring , I forced myself to watch it , and the whole season didn't make sense at all.
The acting of the kids was bad , and the whole ""romantic"" things in the whole season cringed me and was cheesy af.
Season one was really good not gonna lie , and so was season 2 , and season 3 , meh. Not really.
Even the last episode was boring , Jim Hopper died so stupidly , and the whole build-up was really boring and childish .
I regret watching this season , total waste of time .
Summing everything up : season 3 definitely doesn't feel like stranger things...
I hope next season will makeup for it."
513,"I'd give Season 1 an eight or even a nine, purely for Millie Bobby Brown's great performance, but S2 was a HUGE frustration. I made the effort and watch it all and I am not happy about it.They failed - from every angle. I see people say the story had holes - no, it was a complete joke - one huge hole.Most actors were even unbearable to look at, but I don't want to go in detail, since most of them are just children. I don't want to offend children - not their fault. The series creators did a very bad job even with Millie Bobby Brown this time. In their attempt to make her look overly cool and bad ass, because they did it in so cheap cheap cheap way, they actually made her look stupid. It's such a waste of a great talent. Oh, and what's with the ""sister""? Was this girl even an actor?Was S1 just a lucky strike? How can the same people create one good ""movie"" and one complete crap? And now, how is it that most reviews of these series rate them with less than 5 and yet it scored total of 9? wow.. some IMDb calculator here.."
514,"I rarely write a review, but I had to do it after reading some of these other reviews, like it's bad acting all the way. Well, these people probably are used to watching Neighbours or Days of Our Lives and just have no clue about acting in the first place. The kids are great and actually I really like the way Winona Rider plays the mom in this. She looks like the mom that would kill to save her son and that's the point, right?Also people are saying that ""if you take away the 80's effect, it would not be that good."" Well I guess that if you take away the fantasy effect in Lord of the rings, it would also just be a little boy throwing a ring in a volcano, while he is fighting some gypsies or something, so that argument makes absolutely no sense at all! I mean, come on.. The 80's element is a very important aspect of the series, so stop with this nonsense. Me, personally am a huge fan of this 80's nostalgia feeling and the Duffer brothers did an amazing job recreating this aspect.So, if you don't just want to watch another CSI or comedy sitcom (nothing wrong with that tho), this is just what you are looking for! It will keep your interest from the first second to the last. You will definitely not get bored watching this! Enjoy!"
515,"This show has pretty much everything in it and every aspect is don very well indeed.I feel like a kid again watching this, it reminds me so much of that excitement I felt when watching Goonies for the first time, or Explorers, or Back to the Future, ET etc etc.If you grew up in the 80's, you will likely love this. If you did not, you will still like it as it is such an amazing, well paced, interesting, funny and immersive experience with characters that you can really bond with.It is a faithful 80's movie reproduction seen through modern eyes.This show on it's own is worth a netflix subscription."
516,"This show will be remembered long after it's time. It has comedy, romance, action...just everything! The show definitely has a way of making you want to binge watch the entire series in one sitting. After a while, you begin to fall in love with the characters you hated at first. I absolutely recommend this show to all the Sci-Fi lovers out there looking for something different."
517,"I ended up binge-watching the entire season - 4 episodes yesterday and 4 tonight - like so many others!! I thought it was excellent! I'm not even a huge ""80's"" era fan, but this show managed to find the very best of that decade and bring it to positive light. The homage to the films and writers was so well done and the music was amazing! Parts of the show reminded me of ""The Goonies"" and ""Stand By Me"" as well. After I watched the entire season, I realized I was thoroughly entertained and without a single scene of gratuitous violence or sex, something that much of today's programming relies on vs. back in the 80's or earlier. I found it refreshing and yes it's something a family can actually watch together (although very young children might be frightened by the monster). The only reason I did not rate this show a 10 is I thought Ryder's character was a bit too much at times. The constant hysterics wore me out for the first half of the season but it did get better in the second half. I understand she was a panicked mother so I can't put a finger on it. I just found Joyce a little annoying. I'm not sure if that was an acting or writing flaw so I will leave it at that. That was minor though and I still would recommend this show wholeheartedly!! I hope they bring it back for more season(s)!"
518,"Just finished binge watching it. I'm just in love with the setting, the universe they bring back to us. Did you ever wanted that E.T or Goonies went on for 8 hours??? This was it. Just top notch production top to bottom, easter eggs everywhere and many goodies to enjoy a fine piece of work. Characters are lovable an relatable. The story arch was clear and well designed even with twists like the redemption of the douche jock and the ""odd couple born from distress"" not ending up together, with a just enough open ending that probably will stay like that and that's fine (I won't complain if there's a second season, but these guys will probably end up getting some big franchise to write and direct like the Russo brothers did (What is it about brothers working together... Just Magnific. Even the Washowskis in some points)Obviously this doesn't reinvents the genre, but it was an excellent work from everybody involved in the production. You can feel the 80 's alive in this one and if you have little boys you can show them how it felt to be a kid back then, to be a child watching the world through TV and movies.And to the hipsters that think that this was an average series i tell them to go a write a soul for them. Because if you go and find these mediocre ""at best"" (as someone said) i feel really sorry for you and probably your family hates spending Christmas with you.I'm 37 years old and for 8 hours i was 7 again. And that's priceless for me.Just watch it. Really..."
519,"Super disappointed. Target audience has to be 8-14 years old. SO many things are unexplained that need to be explained. Huge plot holes and characters doing things that make absolutely no sense... constantly. What is even worse is that it is often the adult characters who do the stupidest things. Only a young audience could ignore it. Every time there is an intense scene of suspense the screen writer does something dumb to make you say ""Wtf?"" I will just say it... This TV series is really really stupid. There are also some adult centered themes that feel so out of place because most of the story is shown through 4 kids. Adult redemption and revelation themes are silly when 80% of the scenes are either 4 childhood friends or a high school couple. Add in some very shitty CGI to go with it and I am done."
520,Overhyped hot garbage don't waste your time go find a show that's worth watching.
521,"Despite the mind numbing amount of unoriginality in terms of what's happening, characters, and even music, Season 1 is enjoyable.But before you get shocked Netflix missed to ruin one show, they immediately do that starting the first few minutes of Season 2.That's when the Netflix effect we've seen in every other Netflix show kicks in - yes, I'm talking about forced and unrealistic female (and black of course) characters that suddenly make what was unique about the show's psychic character immedialy not cool and unique to her anymore.Clearly the show wasn't meant to be longer than 1 season as proven by the ridiculous wrapping up of events in the last episode of season 1.It could've at least gone in a good direction but no, immediately heading straight down.
Another potential wasted by Netflix.The writing was never good - clueless and filled with plot holes and cliches in fact - but at least the characters were likable in season 1. The kids and mr. sheriff man are good actors."
522,"What a disappointment, most of the episodes were about 15 year olds (supposedly) teenage crushes.
The actual strange stuff seemed like an afterthought to fill in the story, very week script no where near the quality of the first two series.
I just wanted it to end cause I couldn't take any of it seriously.
Not looking forward to yet another series with these writers."
523,"I got hooked onthe show from the first episode and then it came Season 2. Maybe the first season was such a success because it was a total copy of Silent Hill and idea with the kids was pretty neet, but the Second one was really dissapointing.I thought Season 3 will recover but watching the first two episodes was painful, seriously! Firstly, the only good parts of the episodes were 1 min in the beginning and 1 min at the end. Second, kinds are growing, I get that, but dammit change their look a bit. Mike has the same hairstyle as Eleven and I thought two girls are kissing, come on.I don't think I'll be wasting my time with other episodes. There are many shows out there which are much better than Stranger Things. This show is dead!"
524,"The show started off strong, sort of like The Goonies meets the X-Files set in the 80s for pure nostalgic reasons. The first season deserves 10 out of 10 stars, the first season was great.The second season wasn't that bad either, but it started to slip a little.Some Season Three we have a clear cut example of how to destroy a series.They had a formula that worked, they had a formula that was fantastic and people really loved it.And then they left the formula behind and started to turn out stories based on politics and the same outrage culture that tanked so many other shows, comics, franchises, and stories.Characters did abrupt changes to better fit into the political bubble that we are seeing again and again. Good guys became scum bags because of race and gender, the focus characters changed.And what you are left with is a dumpster fire that best describes how to destroy a great show."
525,"I am pretty sure that this series have been growing as a overrated one in recent years but still with that we cannot deny that it is quite good, personally it is very stylish and wins over the audience without hesitation.The wait was worth it."
526,"Netflix you just nailed it once again.Thanks Netflix for bringing such series.watch all seasons without doubt . I am telling you this because friends never lie . Awesome CGI,VFX and the starting theme . Everything was just perfect. The all actors performed well . So watch this 👌👌👌👌👌👌👌💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯💯."
527,"The first season was very good. Season 2 lacked a good story, and it was almost the same as the first season, with a few character developments who were in S1, and a few new characters. Not much to watch in S2."
528,"I am one of those people that was put of by the thought that this was a kid's drama, from the advertising you'd swear this was aimed at a 4 o'clock after school transmission time, the reality is far from that. It's quite intense drama, thoroughly absorbing, the kind of show you can't help but binge watch. As someone that grew up in the Eighties, I can appreciate the detail that's gone into the production, it's like they slipped back and filmed it live, it is incredibly well made. I utterly love the music, it is so fitting, takes me back to wonderful eighties shows. Quality in both season one and two, I like the build up and tension that is abundant in the first. It's like the Goonies meets The Quatermass Experiment."
529,"Wow, anyone who has seen Winona Ryder act over the years would agree she is a good actor.But in this series she is incredible.I believe this is the best work of her career.She plays the character so convincingly, and so completely that it just draws you into the entire premise of the series.The other actors do a great job too. I'd say 8-9/10.Overall, a fantastic series. Great work funding this Netflix!Every episode gets better and better.The other actors who are outstanding are the boys in the Goonies gang. Equally convincing.A top series."
530,"""Stranger Things"" is a very big surprise. After all, it's a made for Netflix series, so it's going to be cheap and suck...right?! Well, no...fortunately. Despite having mostly no-name actors and a modest budget, this show turned out to be a hit and one that promises to bring us more episodes. At the time I am writing this, the eighth episode has been aired and the series appears over...or so you think until the very end.So what is this show? Well, in many ways it's like some Steven King novels (particularly ""Firestarter""), the 1980s and ""Gravity Falls"" all mashed up into one really strange but fascinating show.The show begins with a child being lost into another dimension and his mother is naturally out of her mind with worry. But soon this sense of panic is felt by many in this small community. In the midst of this, a young girl, who is simply named '11' arrives in the town and is hidden by some middle school boys. They know she's being hunted...but what does she have to do with the disappearance as well as folks seeing monsters?! Well, watch this paranoid show and you'll see.So why was the show so effective and why are so many folks eagerly awaiting more episodes? Well, the writing is terrific and the direction really keeps you on the edge of your seats. The acting is also surprisingly good and overall the package is well worth seeing and will impress you. Far better than network television."
531,"Stranger Things has got to be one of the most majestic and intriguing shows I have ever watched. After the first episode you'll be sucked into the small town of Hawkins in 1980s Indiana, where the atmosphere and overall scenery is impeccable. What blew me away the most was the acting, usually when I see child actors in a show I immediately think the quality of acting will be less than great but I was so wrong in this case. From the get go it is very obvious that these kids are insanely talented. Dustin is one of the most likable characters I've come across in a T.V. show or movie and Eleven is just....unbelievable. The plot is so rich and full of secrets, but it is not one of those shows that just continually leaves its viewers in the dark - you get flashbacks and all sorts of good stuff that bring the unknowns of the plot to life.This show is so good that it caused me to write this review and create an IMDb account AND I have a midterm in 4 hours! Do yourself a massive favour and watch Stranger Things ASAP.Patrick"
532,"Season 2 could have been 2 episodes long. Introduces characters that have nothing to do with anything for no reason just to kill them off later. Make this character to compensate for bad writing to resolve some seriously contrived problem going on. Half the episodes were spent explaining stuff that we already know because were watching the show. Filler upon filler, pointless character after pointless character introduced with nothing to do with the story. Dialogue is for moving the story forward not explain every damn thing going on that you can clearly see with your eyes. Bad writing and bad acting. Extremely poor execution of a story that could have been other wise good. If I could say one thing good about the show it would have to be that it definitely has that 80's feeling. That 80's feeling where the writing is awful, pointless characters and tons of filler with no real story. Only this time expanded on with close to 10 hours of crap that could have been condensed to an hour and a half. Over all I felt like I was stuck in a nightmare of never ending crap from the 80's."
533,"Stranger Things is not the worst thing I've seen, But it's far from the best. When it was released, people hyped it too much (and so did I), but re watching ST now, it still a good show, but not that special as I thought it was. Sometimes, it relies too much on nostalgia and 80's references and it bothers me a little bit. The main marketing was the wall thing, but it's barely used, from my head, I remember that they used it about two times in the first season. The series doesn't need a second season, everything was just fine by the end of the first one and things they didn't tell us should be part of our imagination, making us think about it, re watch it, see different things that we haven't seen for the first time, now they are just going to give us the answers. Stranger Things is a good show, but not that much. And doesn't need a second season."
534,"This may contain spoilers.For some reason I expected a sci-fi series, not a horror one. I'm sure it wasn't just me - several of my friends who were excited about this show (and told me about it) clearly said sci-fi multiple times. We were wrong.""Stranger Things"" is a mediocre, uninteresting, seen-it-a-million-times (soft-ish) horror series that tries to ride on the back of 80's nostalgia by ripping off every 80's movie you can think of.Some reviewers compared this movie to E.T. and it is true - the cinematography strongly resembles Spielberg's work (not the quality or the story, mind you). Otherwise that comparison is very unfair: E.T. is an intelligent, charming, emotion-evoking sci-fi and none of that applies to this series. If you read comparisons to other 80's movies, they're probably partially correct because ""Stranger Things"" likely ripped those off, too.The movie is frequently dark to the point where you can hardly see anything on the screen, there's a lot of screeching and screaming and some killing and blood and there's a monster in it for some reason but I don't believe much is revealed about its back-story. What story is present is nonsensical and is simply reused from other horror stories. Nothing original here.Acting is mostly OK (the kids were over the top a few times; nothing too bad). I do feel sorry for Winona Ryder for acting in this - I haven't seen her in a role for a while but I recall her being a good actress (she was OK in this one) and I think she could do better.If you're a horror fan, you may rate it higher but over 9? No way - that would mean this is somehow in the company of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" or ""Schindler's List"". I think this series is about 3 out of 10."
535,"I was reading on here and saw the bad reviews and i had to join the fightI don't agree with the critic, and i don't see how people think the second season was a mistake... i don't think so. i just think there always will be critic no matter what. but some critics in here are just plain stupid and biased on sequel seasons no matter what, so those jokers are just to be ignored. My review for the show Last year i was long time sick, so i had a lot of time to watch movies and series. and even before it went viral and mainstream i found this lovely series. After 1st episode i was sold, and i binge-watched the whole thing, and with great satisfaction. it was great with a setting i've never seen before, and the plot and characters are great too.I obviously waited for season 2 and when it came i wasn't disappointed AT ALL.. Season 2 is even better than season 1, i don't remember how my body reacted to season 1, but in season 2 my heart was beating dangerously fast, and even at one time i was thinking that my heart was beginning to have problems (i'm a 24 year old fit soldier, there shouldn't be anything wrong with my heart) but as i quickly concluded it was because of the series and not any heart condition... So that should say ENOUGH. Stranger Things are on my top 10 over series now, NO DOUBT..10/10 (same i gave GoT)"
536,"If the influences from 80's movies and the actors being children is the most important things you can praise this series for, it proves that its not that good. Story-wise it looks like one good Fringe episode stretched over a whole season and you guess it so early it loses its magic. Yes it is well set up, children are great and 80's thing might pick up your fancy but all these just didn't work for me to forgive the weak plot. Referencing 80's, synth music and all seems like an easy way out these days."
537,"First season 9/10, second season is unwatchable... I had to turn it off after 3 episodes. Yes the atmosphere is there but that's about it. It's completely boring, uninteresting and has very unimaginative writing. They've completely missed what made season 1 great. Yes it's difficult to create a proper sequel, but this is just plain old money grab and laziness. If I wanted to spend hours watching an endless preteen/HS telenovela, Id have the good old Telemundo. Shame, would have loved for season 2 to work out. Most reviews on the net are full of it, calling it better than season 1."
538,a kid with telepathy and telekinesis powers has a bleeding nose every time after she uses her power. check a science teacher / scientist explains how to bend space and time using a paper and a pen and pushing the pen through the paper. checkparallel universes. checkdolphin like sounds making alien monsters. checkguy tries to shoot cans with a gun but fails then an unexpected woman with amazing marksman skills comes and shoots the targets. so cool! check.And everything else is so cliché about this show. And IMDb you are a huge liar because of your fake ratings.This pile of nonsense doesn't deserve anything more than a 6. But then again who would watch it if you had shown such a rating next to it right? You are in this for the money after all. This was the last time I use IMDb to decide whether something is worth watching or not.
539,"Season one was great, season 2 was ok. Season 3 was terrible. I won't bother watching season 4 when it comes out soon."
540,"I love Stranger Things. They did an amazing job on implementing the characters and the time it takes place in. That's because it works. Not because of good direction or writing. I mean, those things aren't bad, just not revolutionary. And the dialogue is kinda cheesy sometimes, especially in season 3. A lot of people criticize season 3 a lot and I can see why, but I actually think it's kinda good. As I said, Stranger Things doesn't depend on a great story or something like that but it has amazing characters and the setting (the 80s) just keeps it interesting. Season 3 definitely has the worst story and dialogue but I still enjoyed it just as much as the other seasons.
9/10 would recommend!"
541,"In my opinion Stranger Things gets better as it goes on! Lots of homages, amazing story, cinematography, thought provoking, and fun to watch. Not everyone loves as much as me which is unfortunate and ok too. I think it's really unfortunate that Stranger Things hasn't really Emmys or golden globes I think it highly deserves them. I'm a bit late to seeing season 3 but damn it's spectacular even if I'm the only one and the HDR quality for my 4K TV is vibrant awesomeness with nice colors."
542,"I really liked the first season - it has its charms.
The second season was watchable.
The third season is a complete failure. It makes virtually no sense at any moment. Everything about it is so illogical that it looks like a parody.
It is as if they picked the worst Hollywood comedies and horrors and made a mix out of it."
543,"I havent written any review for any movies or series. This is the first time. So ignore my writing standards.Season 1: Ok to start with, season 1 was one hell of a show where there was a lot of engaging scenes, perfect horror and thriller effect, nice sentiments and edge of seat thriller, mystery suspense on all episodes which led to me to watch season 1 in one sitting.Season 2 : Couldn resist to compare with the season 1, where it was not good as S1 but to an extent it was engaging to watch S2. Nice drama, horrifying effects at places which was making me to watch one or two episodes a day (working professional so couldn't find time to sit one full day as S1 :-P)Season 3 : Gosshhhhh !!!!! where to start. There is no where to start. I think the writers have taken the advantage of previous seasons success to while away their time in writing of season 3. They have totally changed the genre from thriller horror to romance drama. Not even a single scene was horrifiying or mystery suspense, just nothing and nothing to the core. Couldnt explain all but one scene where i was totally  irritated is Dustin singing sorry song to susie in climax...man do we look like a joke to u !!!!! Nothing more to say.PS : Atleast they could have kept a intimate scene between nancy's mom and billy which i was expecting more which would have healed our anguish :-P"
544,"An excellent season 1 followed by an abysmal season 2 and a fun but not great season 3. Anti Russian propoganda spread at the expense of quality. This cycle made this would-be original to a has-been clichè. Shouldve changed the show rhetoric atleast after reaching the third season , but dont fix what ain't broke eh? A good time for this show to end and let other originals flourish."
545,The show is good n all but i hate this erica character she's annoying and I HATE HER! Feed her to the Mind flayer
546,"Its horrible written.
And now imdb is saying my review is too short. But honestly i have no more words for this show"
547,"There are homages, and there are homages so committed that they become practically indistinguishable from the original works. ""Stranger Things"" definitely belongs in the second category. The Netflix drama, which debuted last month, has won many praise for its success on a creepy throwback tale. Set in 1983, about missing children and extraordinary goings-on in an outwardly average small town. The setting and themes will be immediately familiar to anyone once besotted with that decade's master pop storytellers, Steven Spielberg and Stephen King — a cohort that clearly includes the series creators, the twin brothers Matt and Ross Duffer.Filled with a sense of wonder and awe from the cinematic era of the 1980s, Stranger Things delivers a surprisingly refreshing simple plot and storytelling, enriched by it's keen performances - mainly its child stars - and pacing, which contributes on the delivery of what will feel like an amazingly entertaining 8-hour movie.""Stranger Things"" reminds us of a time marked by a kind of no- strings escapism. And as it does so, we find ourselves yearning for it because the Duffers have made it so irresistibly appealing. There may be other equally great shows to watch this summer, but I guarantee you won't have more fun watching any of them than you will watching ""Stranger Things."""
548,"I've seen all the episodes of Daredevil, House of Cards, Master of None, Narcos, and several other of Netflix's brilliant shows. This is definitely the best one to date. It's scary from time to time, but it's still scarier than 99% of horror movies that come out in theaters these days. All of the actors--including the young kid actors and the adult actors--are brilliant and give outstanding performances. Literally each one of them could be nominated for an Emmy. The fact that they're all unknown actors (save for Winona Ryder) adds to the mysteriousness of the show, and their chemistry and dialogue is spot-on. There's nothing predictable about Stranger Things--each episode had something happen that I never would've predicted. Most shows have moments where you can pretty much guess what's going to happen at certain parts, but NEVER in this show. Once I started the first episode, I ended up binge- watching the rest of the season in one weekend, which is the shortest period of time it ever took me to watch a single show. Really looking forward to season 2!"
549,"Just take my word for granted, it's so bad don't watch... please... i'm so dissapointed i gave away 8 hours of my life to watch season 3, do not make the same mistake as me."
550,"Season with 8 episodes
First 5 ep nothing happens stupid teen script like literally u only see the monster one time, wheres the strange thing?"
551,"Stranger Things has always been known for its dark gritty story with foreboding, ominous turn of events, supernatural powers and monsters. The build up was perfect in the first two seasons but the third season seems more comical and as if monsters are added to keep the audience's interest"
552,"Season 1 is okay, but season 2 is just so boring. I hope they don't make season 3"
553,"This is my first review here, if I remember correctly. I wanted to review this series because, well, I haven't watched anything I felt this way about in a long time, and positive reviews call the attention of other people that may watch it, making it be more popular and getting for sure a second season! I watched the full season, 2 episodes per day, and in my opinion the pace of the series was great. I didn't feel bored in any moment, what usually happens to me in most movies and series ( 2 hours can feel like such a long time!). As everyone mentions, if you've enjoyed the goonies, monster squad, ET and in general 80s movies with a little horror in them, you're gonna love this one. Don't expect any pretentious, artsy stuff; it's just fun, like old Spielberg movies, and it's great at being that. BTW, I've been a fan of tales from the crypt, masters of horror, the twilight zone, are you afraid of the dark, etc., what can also give you an idea of why I loved this series so much."
554,"Why the one who saw Stranger things season 1 and 2 say it amazing coz of new script and we see something different that relationship in the shows, building characters, Action , Drama etc was just amazing no doubt but when it comes to 3rd season we think that enough is enough I mean you can go with same script for all the season something new was missing but still season 3 was also enjoyable if you would not notice much and yes it's last 2 episodes were just epic . That's why I would give it 10 on 10 becoz of entertainment level and satisfaction it gives to us."
555,"Apart from a couple of bad CG shots and a couple of details in the last episode, the first season of Stranger Things borders on perfection. I won't include any spoilers, but if you like films and books like Carrie, Poltergeist, The Goonies, or The Thing, you will probably enjoy this. A lot. Even more so if you grew up in the 1980s.The second season is slightly worse, less atmospheric, less mysterious, more focused on action sequences, but definitely still worth watching. Characters still behave more or less in character, with a couple of exceptions. Visual effects are a mixed bag, with the new ""monster"" looking great, but the ones inherited from season 1 still looking fake and badly animated.The third season, sadly, is a complete mess (both in terms of the overall plot and the behaviour of some characters making no sense). It's still entertaining, in a sillier and more over-the-top kind of way, but it's really closer to Buffy the Vampire Slayer than to the excellent first series. The visual effects are excellent.On a scale from 1 to 10, I would rate the first three seasons 10, 8, and 6, respectively. Hopefully season 4 won't be a 4."
556,"I watched three seasons of the series. The first season created a good hype about what's gonna happen next. But the next two seasons, especially the last season ruined that primary hype. So I would give a rate 8 to S1, 7 and 6 to the last two respectively."
557,"How could this thing get such good reviews?
Sure, some acting is good, but most of it is totally incoherent, there is no dramaturgic cohesion, the tone switches from heavily dramatic to almost satirical like some kinf of 2 1/2 bullets demential parody, and the series completely loses all credibility.
It does not scare anymore, does not move anymore, does not amuse or make you laugh anymore. It is just such a milkshake of all flavours at once and it is over the top in everything, but not enough in anything.
Besides, it is three series of THE SAME, same enemy, same monster, same place, same dynamic. BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING!
Now at the end of the third series they show the same monster again.
I will not watch one single episode of the fourth series if it will be the same thing again."
558,"The debut of ""Stranger Things"" in 2016 marked the first real, huge streaming TV phenomenon. Other Netflix shows had made an impression before: ""House of Cards"" in 2013 and ""Orange Is the New Black"" shortly thereafter proved that streaming was coming for cable's gig, hard. But it was the nostalgia grabs and exhilarating monster chases of ""Stranger Things"" that truly exploded in the zeitgeist - which is the only concrete factor we have to go on, given Netflix's famous reticence to disclose viewership numbers.Without a ton of pre-release press (the better to maintain its mystique), the Duffer Brothers' ""Stranger Things"" seemed to pop out of nowhere - a burst of a summer blockbuster sliced into palatable ""chapters"" like an addictive page-turner of an adventure book. Its 1983 setting, complete with myriad throwback references, was perfectly calibrated to tap into the significant strain of TV and movie fans who yearn for the onscreen ""Goonies"" adventures (or even star Winona Ryder) of their youth. For a while it was just about impossible to escape the show's signature images: an intrepid Dungeons and Dragons party (played by Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, and Gaten Matarazzo), a frantic mother (Ryder) and surly sheriff (David Harbour) decoding a wall of blinking lights, telekinetic heroine Eleven (breakout Millie Bobby Brown), glaring with a shorn head, steadily bleeding nose, and perhaps an Eggo waffle for extra strength.
The second season, which dropped on Halloween in 2017, tried hard to capture that original magic with a couple extra twists in the forms of hothead bully Billy (Dacre Montgomery) and his spunky kid sister Max (Sadie Sink). But the fact that the season was so highly anticipated inevitably spiked expectations so that when ""Stranger Things"" stumbled with a classic sequel blunder (""what if we did the same thing people loved so much last time, but bigger?""), it was even more of a disappointment.Enter Season 3. While ""Stranger Things"" will always have its diehard fans, this season has far more to prove about the show's overall longevity than any other. Debuting almost two years after season 2, but taking place several months after, the scrappy kids we first met three years ago are now gangly teens struggling to reconcile their childhood passions with their flailing hormones. Opposites-attract couple Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and introvert Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) are spending their summer interning at the local paper, while exiled prom king Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) rolls his eyes scooping ice cream at Hawkins' shiny new mall. Cary Elwes, an actor dogged by nostalgic fascination not unlike Ryder, taps in as the town's slimy mayor and perpetual Hopper adversary. Hopper himself (Harbour) is gritting his teeth while Eleven, now officially dating Mike (Wolfhard), tests his patience and ""keep the door three inches open at all costs"" rule.
As for what actually happens in season 3...well, it's almost impossible to say. Literally. The list of ""do not reveal"" spoilers Netflix sent alongside advance episodes is as long as it is strategic, prohibiting me from so much as hinting at who (or what) the determined citizens of Hawkins, Indiana are up against this time. The less the ""Stranger Things"" audience knows going in, the more exciting its twists and turns may be, so goes the wisdom following the first season's success.What I can reveal is that by the time the final credits roll on season 3 (plus a post-credits scene you won't want to miss), it's made much more of a case for itself than season 2 ever did simply by trying to be something different. The mall especially proves to be a rewarding new location that sets the stage for more inventive battles. Even displacing the action from the spooky grays of late fall to the saturated heat of midsummer shifts the tone and challenges the directors to convey creeping unease through Technicolor sweat. Later scenes set in the manic frenzy of a Fourth of July carnival are so vivid you can smell the popcorn and funnel cake.The summer 1985 setting also emphasizes time has irrefutably passed, and season 3 does interesting work as it grapples with that fact. For one: Will (Schnapp), traumatized from his time in the Upside Down and always the group's most tender member, tries to slow his friends down as they obsess over girls. Steve tries to find his place in the world outside a high school hierarchy, challenged all the while by his unimpressed coworker, Robin (Maya Hawke). Max, a well-intentioned character who nonetheless often acts as a cipher for the ones around her, takes on the task of befriending and empowering Eleven, who's still trying to find an identity all her own. (Does this include a shopping montage to ""Material Girl""? You know it!)Three seasons deep, ""Stranger Things"" is also more comfortable leaning into character combinations that have proved successful in the past - like the enthusiastic odd couple pairing of Steve and Matarazzo's Dustin - in order to break up the action into separate stories that eventually converge. Before their inevitable final reunion, the core cast is split into four factions with varying degrees of success. On the frustrating side lie Dyer and Heaton, solid but uninspired in an investigation that takes its sweet time connecting to everyone else, and Ryder and Harbour, who have a prickly chemistry that proves grating when isolated. (It's unclear why Hopper also tends to cross the line from ""charming grump"" to ""sour jerk"" more this season, but he sure does.) Conversely, Sink and Brown tap into a giddy energy that makes a forced friendship feel more elastic and real, while Priah Ferguson, playing Lucas' wry younger sister Erica, quickly justifies her convoluted entry into the main cast. Keery, who boasts the show's best comic timing by a mile, gets a worthy scene partner in Hawke; their growing friendship is one of the season's unequivocal highlights."
559,Stranger Things is a rare occasion where the characters outshine the plot and concept. Incredible acting makes for such a fun experience. With the first 2 seasons focusing on a mystery/horror tone where as the third season switched up to a more Adventure type of show. Honestly the character chemistry would make or break a show like this and luckily the chemistry is some of the best on television.
560,"The best and auspicious movie of netflix so far. Season 1 and 2 was incredible... Little bit disappointed after watching 3, that doesn't mean it was bad. It was far better than other web series..In short; hatsoff to this series. One must watch it... Highly recommended.
1 star less for just the ending of season 3 , otherwise i have rated it 10/10."
561,"Just perfect. Magical. Outstanding direction, superb writing, gorgeous and lavish cinematography, and top notch acting."
562,"What better to Netflix and Chill than see a bunch of kids traumatised for their life. Okay, but the dialogs and the bloopers and such an amazing cast makes for a very good series."
563,It's a good series but the story is repeated in every season so it's need something unusual!
564,"Stranger things is really good series but the problem is that every season starts with one problem and they all find out about it, then they all invesigate alone, after 4 or 5 episodes of that they all group ap and solve that problem. The scene when someone is in danger you can expect that someone is going to come from somewhere and just save that character. The series is really good and I enoy watching it, but I just dont like it to start same and finish the same"
565,My daughter and I love this show. We have re watched all 3 seasons many many times just waiting for season 4. Love it!!!!!
566,"First season : 10
second season : 9
third season : 7"
567,"Season 1 was a straight 10 for me.
The second season was also a straight 10.
The 3rd was really good still, I'd give it an 8.5 but that is where the show needed to end, bringing in a 4th season is a decision I'm rather sceptical about. And while I'll still watch It, it's brought the shows rating down for me."
568,"The show draws you in immediately, but there's little substance behind the veil of 80s nostalgia. The story and characters seems more like an afterthought, just contrived content to carry the aesthetics.The actors are talented, but it shows that the characters and their experiences don't draw on personal experience (as the Duffers are to young to remember the early 80s). It's like an AI was fed a bunch of 80s movies and put together a show from that."
569,"What is going on, the writers and direction has turned these season 1 and 2 loveable kids into a bunch of brats. Hopper is now portrayed as a moron. The story line with the Russians is ridiculous. After episode 6 I stopped watching. Really disappointed. I loved Season 1 and 2, but this season is a total failure on so many levels."
570,"Stranger Things advertises itself as paying homage to John Carpenter, and 80s horror in general, as a marketing tactic to distract you from the works it is actually plagiarizing, specifically Elfen Lied and Silent Hill. Young girl with out-of-control telekinesis uses her powers to escape from the lab which is the only world she's ever known, then taken in by local kids who hide and socialize her? That's the plot of Elfen Lied. Throw in the ""Upside-Down"" and you have Silent Hill, right down to the ash floating in the air. I enjoy this show, for all the same reasons as everyone else, however I am sick to death of writers having no original thought. Season 2 was less unoriginal than season 1, but as with many other shameless ripoff shows (e.g. Mr Robot, aka Fight Club), they run out of steam to the point of failing to break new ground the minute their ripoff material is exhausted. ""Figuring out what's going on in the story"" has become ""figuring out which story they're stealing from"". I empathize with the writers, as those people don't get paid nearly enough, and as with all things you get what you pay for, but the fact is that Stranger Things is about as shameless a storytelling ripoff as I've ever seen."
571,"This is one of those cult shows that everyone loves but actually isn't very good when you take a step back from the production values. Yes, the tone, costumes and sets are amazing - you're really taken back to 80's retro and it works. It really does. But they all. The story is paper thin, reusing the same story line over and over season after season. The kids (once you spend time with them) are thoroughly unlikeable and by season 3 I honestly wanted them to die. The conclusion from every tense event is '11 uses her powers to safe them'... yawn. Winona Ryder is good as the crazy Mum (for obvious reasons) but that only works in season 1 when the son is missing / after that it's just normal Winona crazy. And a giant Russians underground lab that no one saw being built? Come on I know it's fiction but that's just dumb. Watch for yourself I suppose"
572,I hope this show doesn't end like every other netflix show but what can ya do
573,"The first two seasons were pretty decent, but season 3... I felt like I was watching a corny hollywood action movie with very cringy jokes."
574,"1 epic, 2 good, 3 garbageDont waste your time on season 3"
575,Stranger things is a very popular and trendy show especially among teenagers. I really like this show and the story is just really great. Season 1 and 2 were amazing and season 3 was good but it wasn't amazing. I love how the cast are child actors yet they are incredibly talented child actors. The characters work really well as a team but individually some of them can be kind of annoying. Although I really like this show I do think that it is overhyped. This show is great but there are many others that are just as good if not better that don't get anywhere near as much hype surrounding them. My worry about this how is that it will just get stretched out and get worse and worse.
576,STRANGER THINGS is a family friendly series. The talented actors make this adventure more wonderful and interesting. Really a heart touching story. And I love fiction .
577,"When a young boy disappears, his mother, a police chief and his friends must confront terrifying supernatural forces in order to get him back.Think about it like this it's a mix between E.T and the x_files in a really good way, the kids are just so talented ,its hard to talk more about the story but you will enjoy,the series is a winner of Golden Globes 2017 & 2018 for best drama series, i Would just say season 1&2 incredible season 3 a lot of why ?! ."
578,Amazing series with Spielberg vision of parallel world existence with the Hint of Steven Kings script.
579,"Amazing show, just started watching it today after have put it off for so long. I just did not Think it was for me but boy was I wrong! I'm still at season 1, but enjoying it. My only thing is who did they have to make Lucas sooo anoying! Everytime he opens his mouth i am really really annoyed! Anyways, besides that, so far it's great"
580,"Although there are some logical imprecisions, they do not hinder the overall perception. The little actors are very good at acting. The suspense is intriguing."
581,That one episode in season 2 is the reason it's not a 10
582,"Loved it. It's something abit different, while feeling a tad nostalgic with its 80s feel."
583,"Unfortunately, Stranger Things is another overrated and over hyped pop culture product. It is sad to see that this is a wasted opportunity whereas it has so much potential."
584,After reading reviews I had hoped that this show was going to be very entertaining but..Finished watching two seasons and they were enjoyable but nothing too mind grabbing. I continued watching hoping that I would find something that I was missing but before I knew I had finished two seasons. Similar story has been done many times in the past and this was just different mask for same old story of monsters vs humans.Acting is good but I couldn't connect to any of those characters. May be it was meant for kids so they dumbed it down but it was still confusing for kids in some level.
585,"After enjoying both season 1 and 2, I had very high hopes for season 3. Getting to know more about the upside down and its major goal that it's trying to reach. Sadly enough, nothing of that. What we do get is a lot of scenes showing the fun chemistry between some of the characters. Kudos for the actors on that. But again story wise not a lot happens. The major letdown for me was the ending of season 3, which was, once again, the gang closing a portal. Now where did we see that before. Also they could've done a lot more with the Billy character. Felt bad they had to let him go.
So for season 4, I really hope they work out a more thought through plot. I know, I love all the 80'd references and that's the thing which is currently keeping the series so popular. But I would really hope that Duffer brothers will emphasize less on the 80's feel and more on an original plot that will keep you on the edge of your seet. Make it happen, guys!"
586,Justin Roiland u know we can understand u right? 😁
587,"So: 9 stars for the 1st season, 8 - for the 2nd; with the bar set so high, sorry - 3rd season is complete and utter failure, 2 stars at most. If you just starting to watch the whole franchise - stop after 2nd season.
PS: I would keep it 5 stars, but the 3rd season finale deserves its own negative star."
588,"Yes, there were a few bad episodes, but in the big picture, this show comes up nearly perfect. Brilliant writing and characters. Suspenseful moments and cliffhangers. It's truly like no other. When I say there were a few bad episodes one in particular caught my eye. I'm talking about that stupid filler episode in season 2 where 11 meets the others. That was like the writing of a CW show (no offense) Other than that I didn't have any other problems. Definitely a must watch if you haven't seen it. Also, this show is like exactly the same as that one movie Super 8. I genuinely wonder how they got away with it?"
589,First of all I love how this show takes you right back to the 80's when life was far more simple and straightforward. Back when smartphones and other gadgets didn't dominate people's minds.The first season was brilliant. It keeps you hooked from the beginning to the end. The plot and characters were very nicely written and the sci-fi element was very well executed.The second season however was a disappointment compared to the first season owing to some newly added characters such as Max and her brother Billy. The actors that portrayed the two characters respectively were just awful. Both Dacre and Sadie need to improve their acting. Another horrible thing about this season was the episode where Eleven joins a gang and attacks certain groups of people. That episode was completely unnecessary and unwanted. Overall this is a good show but certain characters need to be removed and please no subplots.
590,"First off, I'm not an Eighties movies fan, not in the sense that I don't like those movies, but more of that I haven't really watched that many of them, at least not the ones that Stranger Things supposedly pays homage to.That being said, what made me love this series clearly wasn't nostalgia. How do I put it into words? To understand, you'll probably have to watch it yourself to find out. The premise is simple enough. A boy disappears, and his friends try to find him. Along the way, they become entangled in strange supernatural incidents, that is the monsters/conspiracy theory kind. It starts with a slow but sure pace, gradually turning on the suspense, with revelation after another coming as the plot thickens and develops superbly.There's solid acting from the cast: the kids, Winona Ryder and David Harbour; some people complain about Winona Ryder's overacting, but how else would you expect a mother whose child disappears to be like? The kids are also instantly likable and convincing, with a refreshing spirit that shines through.The story develops very well, but it isn't of the countless convoluted plot twists kind: simple enough, but pulls you in anyhow. It draws inspiration from the 80's sci-fi/horror genre, but it's not frightening or scary, instead, what stands out, at least for me, is the underlying mood. Sure, their friend has disappeared, but they always have the admirable childlike hope and enthusiasm; there isn't any sense of despair among them. Even their love of science, especially with their science teacher, is infectious. Nostalgia certainly didn't get me, but perhaps what did is the amalgam of sci-fi, fantasy, science, mystery and suspense that is this show.So thank you Netflix for making this show happen. I mean, House Of Cards was great(I binged-watched it too), but Stranger Things was something else altogether. For a moment(a very long one), it made me feel like I was back reading LOTR again, wishing and trying so hard to believe in magic...trying to convince myself that it was all real."
591,Let me just say this show is nothing like the first two seasons. Save yourself the time and forget it. My boys were like this is stupid and they loved the first ones. All about sex now.
592,"Nice core story and cool recreation of the 80's environment. Too bad that this includes ripping off many elements from popular films of that time: the series is a combination of ""E.T."", ""Alien,"" ""Signs"" and ""Close Encounters..."" Doesn't anybody have an original idea for a series anymore?And the dialogues are sooo laaame!! As if they were written by the three children who are the main characters. That's a pity, because they really get in the way of enjoying the show. There are so many clichés that this also becomes irritating... How many times can you get away with characters keeping stupid secrets from each other, when there is no need to do that? How many times can characters just say ""trust me on this..."" instead of explaining why they want people to do something? And how come in the parallel universe you have the same buildings, except with weed growing all over them? Why is it always night there? Why are there no people (except a poorly-dressed monster), yet there are lampposts on the streets, but no lights inside buildings?Well, if you're 8 years old, I guess you're not bothered by any of this."
593,"I'm not gonna say much about this. Stranger Things has a 9.1 on IMDb, so that means it's one of the best shows ever, but I don't see why the ratings are so high. Episode 1 was good (7/10), episode 2 was good (7/10), and episode three was good as well (7/10), but I have no idea how they get 8.7, 8.6, and 9.1/10 ratings on here. For other TV shows, for an episode to get more than a 9/10 it has to be something spectacular. Here, it seems like anything remotely good can get an 8.5 or a 9/10 just because it is in Stranger Things. I think the ratings for this are only so high because people are so nostalgic about the 80's and are more influenced by their nostalgia than by actual quality of the episodes. Overall, Stranger Things is a good show and very well produced, but it's not the masterpiece that people say it is."
594,"the only very amazing thing about this is the setting or mise en scene of the 80's; including the photography, music and dressing of the characters. Winona also has a solid performance, as an experienced actress. Everything else is f*king stupid. WHY THE HYPE? It's a generic story with generic characters who are not likable, except for the curly haired kid. Sci-Fi? really? please... Waste of time. I know everyone loves the bald kid, this show, the ""love stories"", but I'm not one of them. i don't see anything special about this, AT ALL. Seriously, why you like this, people? If we're talking about weird ""sci-fi"" stuff who has no scientific background whatsoever you can totally watch Twin Peaks. WAY BETTER. This is laughable, boring, generic, and too long for the slow paced and weak story line."
595,"It is one of those series, which starts with ""just enough"" steam to pique viewers' curiosity, slowly unfolding with details that fit in to explain the bits of the fast beginning.It is a great sci-fi watch for kids, adults alike; with good acting from lead roles (Hopper and Joyce), and a bunch of kids who happen to have a way of their own for solving problems in the adults' world.there's enough sci-fi, teenage crush, kids' silly lingo, monsters that we don't understand, telekinetic booyah moments in this show to keep you hooked through the series.I hope the next season develops more interesting facets to the seemingly already told story."
596,"Season one: 10/10
season two: 7/10 - except for episode 7 which is 0/10
season three: 0/10
season four: don't care"
597,Season 3 was very good. I don't understand the hate on it.
598,"Wow!! What a load of dross season 3 is. Annoying kids, thick really thick characters who can't see what is coming. A 'small' town (small towns in the US look like medium size cities elsewhere) that has so much going on with a not so scary monster that I assume most of the residents are comatose ( maybe after watching Lost in Space). I didn't expect reality but a secret Russian laboratory deep underground in the US? Doesn't say much for Homeland Security. Or how about the same lab when run by the Americans abandoned with nothing much as a security guard especially after what happened in the previous two seasons. Poor poor scriptwriting making the characters look dumb."
599,"Stranger things is a great show. It's unique, it's fun, it's entertaining. But it isn't good enough for the lapses on time between seasons. If you're going to wait almost two years to release a new season, it needs to be superb for the viewers to feel it's worth the wait. I like it much less for its inability to truly wow us with so much time between seasons. The longer we wait as viewers the more we expect. A good watch, but not significant for this simple reason."
600,"Average story telling, good image and sound. acting is good but there are some moments when it feels too slow. a bit streched, episodes. will there be season 4? probably.
why would russians wear military uniforms on enemy teritorry, is beyond my comprehension.
by far the best thing, and because it wad unexpected, was that pool guy. first i believed he was a side plot, then just a zombie chief. but they tell us here and there his story. and it is believable sad. the actor is good. a villan to remember."
601,"I jumped on the hype train too and tried this show. I watched season 1 and 2 within some days and I have to admit that the series is good - but not more.I cannot understand how people go ham watching this series, it looks like any hollywood teen movie (for example ""IT"") for me.If you wanna see some real good mystery Netflix series go watch ""Dark"" because it's way more tense and simply better in every discipline."
602,"Review of Season One:STRANGER THINGS is a much-vaunted TV series made as a throwback tribute to 1980s cinema of old and mixing together the horror, science fiction, fantasy, and adventure genres. Imagine THE GOONIES mixed with FIRESTARTER and with a little bit of H.P. Lovecraft thrown in and you'll be close. As a huge fan of the 1980s and 1980s cinema as well (it was my decade of my childhood, after all), I was eager to watch this. I was left feeling mildly disappointed. This isn't a bad series, not by a long shot, and it's quite entertaining to watch. The cast are varied and give a series of good performances and there's enough incident and mystery in every episode to keep you watching. However, I was surprised at how derivative and unsurprising it all feels. The plot plays out in the most predictable way imaginable, with obvious heroes and villains, bits of THE BLOB and the like added to the mix, and a strong sense of familiarity hanging over the proceedings. There's a heavy emphasis on low rent CGI whereas I thought practical effects would have fitted the series better. Nothing that happens will surprise you, and some sub-plots feel more than a little dragged out. Still, I've watched the trailer for season two and it looks bigger and better, so I'll be coming back to check it out.Review of Season Two:Season 2 of the show follows on much as the first, albeit without the sense of freshness. Once again we get mired in a plot of likeable kids, shady adults, weird CGI creatures and plenty of action and adventure mixed into the running time. Some of the best things about this season are the songs (as cool as ever) and the appearance of '80s actors like Sean Astin and Paul Reiser. I did think at times, however, that this was a bit half-hearted, made up of left-over bits that they didn't manage to fit into the first season; come the end we really haven't progressed very far from what came before.Review of Season Three:The good news is that Season 3 is the best yet and a real step up on what's come previously. The story is as cliched as ever, but there's more incident this time around, more drama and a heck of a lot more suspense. Billy's character becomes one of the most interesting in the show while the new characters proceed to wow and touch the audience as much as the originals. The CGI effects are better and the series has a real momentum which builds to some massively impressive set-pieces. I could have done without the sickly sentimentality of the last 20 minutes of the final episode, but the rest is generally very good."
603,"When season 1 came out it showed up in my recommendations, so I figured sure why not. By the end of the season finale I was just in awe. One the best shows I have seen in years. I have been waiting for a year for season two to come out. I just got done binge watching it and season two is a huge disappointment. It was like watching the second Matrix movie destroying the franchise. I don't know what they were thinking but I could barely make it through.Season 1: 10/10 Season 2: 4/10"
604,"Stranger Things is a total flashback to everything that you loved about the 80's! I had the perfect amount of scare factor, anxiety, and nostalgic qualities that I look for in any TV show.The Cast of mostly unknown children: Will, Mike, Lucas, & Dustin did a very believable job to sell this story. Don't get me wrong there are a few parts that will make you chuckle during this 8 hour adventure but those same parts to me made it all the better. I loved the premise of the entire show and found myself numerous times wanting to look away or cover my eyes knowing something was coming and I DID NOT want to see it. The score and music in this series was amazing as well.I am very happy to see Winona Ryder back on TV and she played the Character of Joyce Byers perfectly. Very Believable. I thought her entire performance was great!The remaining supporting cast was also great. David Harbour as Chief Jim Hopper was great as well. He brought the real emotion and feel to his role and the minor subplot that slowly unravels up to the final reveal was amazing. Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven was also Amazing! Every scene she graced was that much better and just her facial expressions alone showed so much emotion. Her subplot as well was wonderful to watch slowly unwind to the reveal as well.I really hope they are able to spin this off for a second season and they left us with that ONE single moment to make it possible and for us viewers to cross our fingers and wait.If you are looking for a great serious with an 80's feel and a fun spin on everything you loved from that era prepare to Binge!"
605,"There's no good reason for this being 9/10, I watched the first Episode attentively... PLEASE don't let your girlfriend talk you into it because of the cute Kids or the nice music. It is horrible guys, very cliched Sephen King - stuff."
606,"I will actually give this show a overall 5.5 or 7 in some good scenes but I see a lot of crazy people gave 10 stars? Are you fuking crazy? So I have to give it a 2 to trying to make it reflect the true star worthy!This TV series is so boring so slow and so messy, the ending scene clearly is an after thought for season 2! The plot has too many unclear things, it's just too much flaw...The casting is very on point, most of the actors are quite good but maybe the casting is so on piont it becomes very stereotype and cliché!I don't see why people go crazy for this tbh! I only watch it because I was bored"
607,"I'm sure the horror / gore addicts will fail to understand why I give this show such a low rating. My explanation is simple: garbage in, garbage out. The mind is impressionable, regardless of age. What we take in, influences our thoughts, whether we admit it or not. Stranger Things started out as an interesting mystery with very well-developed (if cliché) characters and a terrific story. Since it starred child actors, even with its PG-13 rating one would believe it was intended as family viewing, to appeal to younger ages. There is where it misleads the audience.While there were various ""wince"" moments, the first season (and most of the second) was tolerable within its genre. The PG-13 rating let parents know this was not for children and if they had any sense, they kept younger ones away from the screen.This somewhat restrained state continued well into season 2... and then without warning suddenly changed into a gory blood-fest that would gain any movie an R-rating and a televised series a strong TV-MA.No spoilers: the very last of Season 2 was cliché, unnecessary, over-the-top and well beyond the established parameters of the show to that date. Even as an adult one episode especially turned my stomach and caused me to avert my eyes (viewers will know which one I'm discussing) and turned this from a fascinating monster mystery into a gruesomely detailed bloodbath.I recognize this show is fascinating and I realize it has been nominated and won numerous awards. I also recognize when viewers have been duped, lured into a PG-13 show and then presented R-level gore... and I have zero tolerance for such tactics... especially when young viewers may be involved.Some people see no problem with the blood-fest dropped on the ending of season 2... but how would parents have felt if instead of gore the directors had dropped in a hard-R-rated sex scene into the ending of the season? Would that have been tolerated? It seems some writers and directors just don't know where the line is that they should. not. cross.Had I known in advance the direction this show was going to take I'd have never began watching it in the first place. I won't be watching season three. I'm sure some people out there won't ""get"" what I'm talking about, and that's a shame. People become jaded and don't even realize it.Such things forced upon the viewing audience without warning earns from me a low 3-star rating for a show that otherwise could have been rated much higher."
608,"What the hell happened to this pretty good format? Scène after scène is so disappointing. Watched about 30 minutes, but had to stop The nonsense!"
609,"Waste of time show with no direction. They want you to show how weak you are by enjoying this show. Its a loop of garbage with a cast that is no longer adorable or charismatic, but painfully awkward and unlovable like a politician. Fantastic intro tho!!!! Unfortunatley Netflix has gone out of their way to ruin that as well with the ""skip intro"" option. Have fun watching LOST with the skip intro option, a profoundly stupid and disrespectful choice from Netflix....Wake The F up people. You're being recycled you fools. Let me guess, you think KISS is cool too? They're terrible, and not at all bad***, its fluff rock. This show is fluffier."
610,"Stranger Things is a series which in it's last 2 seasons, at least, gets the most interesting characters killed, while other characters that are very bad and boring get to live. I got devastated from watching this thing and I hope that in the next season ( if there will be one ) it will resolve some of it's major problems thay it has. Absolutely disastrous !"
611,"Everyone has got the mix of movies this series combines or rip-offs. Winona Ryder does a great job and is totally believable but she is basically doing a female Richard Dreyfuss in Close Encounters. On the one hand, every role has a parallel in something you've seen before. On the other hand, you can't say that all the actors don't do good jobs or that the show isn't entertaining. Actually very entertaining. I guess the person who steals the show is the young girl who plays ""Eleven"" Millie Bobby Brown and Winona Ryder comes in second and Natalia Dyer is kind of fun to watch as well but nowhere near Ryder or Millie Bobby Brown. But Steven Spielberg and about 6 other directors and writers should have their names added to the credits. But, heh, it's TV. It's Netflix and it is good."
612,"Had a hard time sitting through the first episode and skipped through scenes in order to not bore myself to death and still see what the story is about.*next paragraphs contains mild spoilers* As a sci-fi adventure lover I gave this series a chance even though I loathe horror type stories. I do not enjoy it when they try to scare me with monsters which is probably the biggest reason why this show did not perk my interest. But it was not the only reason.The first scene I had to skip through was the two teenagers bickering about nonsense. The guy pushing the girl to spend time with him while she wanted to do schoolwork. How could such vain dialogue interest anyone? The second scene I had to skip through was the mother yelling hysterically at the cop while he was trying to type up the report. I don't enjoy looking at women yelling while waiting on the plot to progress but having to listen to it is just unbearable. How do people enjoy sitting through a scene like that for entertainment purposes?*end of spoiler part* I noticed many dialogues did not add any real value to the story line and were just inserted as scene fillers or standard, unoriginal character building.All in all most scenes were pretty standard story line protocol, not very creative and therefore just too predictable."
613,When you run out of ideas but got paid to keep churning out the product Season 3 is what you get. Steve and Nancy are the best characters. Mike and El have as much chemistry as Hopper and a Closed Door. End it already. Do a 2 hour movie and conclude the story. Please.
614,"STRANGER THINGS was a pleasant surprise. It sprawled comfortably on Netflix's browsing page very recently. Needless to say, I binged all eight (8) episodes in one sitting. STRANGER THINGS, as mentioned in several other reviews, is the ""fruit smoothie"" of 80s culture. Take in a tablespoon of Stephen King, a few dashes of Spielberg, and a whole lot of 80s horror/thriller culture, blend it together and you essentially have STRANGER THINGS. To start off, the fact that this is NOT a reboot or sequel to a film or television show that debuted in the 80s time period is actually relieving. Not that I necessarily have anything against that, but this series really goes to show that an original concept can still be filled with nostalgia but have its own identity. Hopefully, that will encourage future film/series creators. Regarding the show itself, I found myself on several occasions praising the acting (ESPECIALLY by the children), and engrossed with the plot. I can most definitely appreciate the choice of having this as a television show as opposed to a short movie. It really gave a chance to flesh things out. The plot, while relatively simple, is filled with several cliché tropes - however, they are utilized much differently, which is another thing I happened to enjoy. The ""walking backwards and accidentally tripping over something"" action DOES NOT lead to a death. The car engine actually STARTED. The girl actually doesn't give too much of a damn (romantically) about the nerdy/weird/outcast guy EVEN AFTER EXPERIENCING A LIFE-CHANGING SITUATION together. Again: a breath of fresh air. My only real gripe with the show had to be the ending. However, this is all hypothetical and essentially not solid. The plot really showcases itself as a one season deal - however, the show creators already confirmed that season two would be a sequel to season 1. I felt that season one's ending should have been more conclusive as opposed to purposely leaving many loose ends to pick up in season two. HOWEVER, if season two does pick up these loose ends and thread them into something even more awesome, then it's a win-win situation and I will be happy with season one's ending. Also, to nitpick, the underlying themes of ""mystery"" and ""folklore"" seem to be muddled and messy. Individually, the themes are very strong from an episode-to- episode basis; sadly, as a whole, the show really loses these themes and you're left with a pure thriller-adventure as opposed to the cool dark sci-fi feeling.+awesome characters+superb acting +engrossing plot-possibly weak ending-muddled directionSTRANGER THINGS - binge-worthy - 9/10"
615,"Yes it's OK. Very dull until episode 4 when the story actually begins to become a little less predictable. The story is a blend of poltergeist meets underworld meets the goonies. Beautiful attention to details of the period but one can't help feel this attention has come at the expense of a consistent storyline. 011 is an excellent actress and deserves a huge amount of praise. We stuck with it until the end and it was enjoyable and I'm glad I watched it. However, it's once watched you probably wouldn't bother again. Its chewing gum for the eyes and sitting through it again would be akin to popping yesterday's gum back in. Still chewy enough to work your jaw but without any flavour."
616,"It was nice to watch 1 and 2 season but third season
seems like creators are out of ideas and can't came up with new story."
617,"The show is actually not bad. Getting so many kids to play coherently is a huge feat in itself. However, the script writers are failing them on every corner. They made the kids WAY too modern. The only thing that differentiates them from today's kids is the lack of cellphones. ""Stalking"" wasn't ""a thing"" in the 80s. ""Abuse"" wasn't the word used for every occasion. Everyone is driving Ford Pintos and AMC Pacers or some huge dreadnouts. If they ever make the next season, I hope they find writers who can actually remember what the life was like in the 80s' not imagine it. The ""horror"" part is a waste of screen time. The fans of real horror shows will find it way too lame and those of us who hate it (like me) will find it simply unnecessary. It's a great show and a great idea but it needs more polishing. Kudos to the young actors though, they did a great job. As a matter of fact, the whole main cast did. Except Wynona. But she has lots of fans, and I won't upset them with my personal opinions."
618,"I had heard of this show for quite a while yet never had the inclination to watch. But then, I had the opportunity to do so and basically binged all 3 seasons in a week. Once I was done I started to read the reviews and I must say I agree with many of them.Obviously, this is a very well made show and season 1 is the best of course but season 2 also satisfied me with a neat and effective resolution. And then came 3 and as most will agree, this is 1 too many.Not only was the premise of this show only based on one great idea which had ran its course but also, the tone and the characters changed drastically starting with season 3. The new story which is really a rehash of the previous one became too convoluted and felt like a reheated lasagna past its expiration date.If they had started with a totally fresh story it might have worked but it felt too similar as if starting over with a slightly different approach could make things seem all new again.I found season 3 to be quite painful to sit through because not only the delicious mystery present in 1 and 2 has vanished replaced by a sort of ""dramedy"" with the cast of characters seeming to struggle in their new quest to stay relevant.If season 3 had been the first, it might not have suffered as much in comparison with the 2 great seasons that preceded it but coming after such amazing and groundbreaking work, 3 has an indisputable feeling of been there done that.For this reason, even though I would rate season 1 a perfect 10 and season 2 a very strong 9, season 3 brings down my final rating to 6 stars. Still worth a watch but if you skip 3 altogether, you won't miss much of anything."
619,"I can't watch the show. It was so slow-paced. And I get bored easily, so this show didn't captivate me for long. Or at all tbh."
620,"Season one was perfect in all aspects... but season 2 was season 1 all over again with the characters changing to the worst, eleven become angry, petty and really childish.... And many stupid plot holes"
621,"""Stranger Things 2"" (2017) is the second season that serves as a sequel for ""Stranger Things"" (2016). The season continues the story of Eleven, actually named Jane, (Millie Bobby Brown) as she discovers the potential of her powers and her past. The gang is also back with Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) and Will (Noah Schnapp) trying to assimilate the strange events that took place last season and the arrival of newcomer Max (Sadie Sink). Mike's older sister, Nancy (Natalia Dyer), also struggles to cope with last season's traumatic events alongside Steve (Joe Keery) and Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), Will's older brother. The story that was started last season evolves and grows organically during season 2. The protagonists grow as characters as they are faced with new challenges and old mysteries. With a number of different story arcs, most of the characters' range of emotions, aspirations and personalities are deepened in interesting new ways (Including a love triangle or two). During season 2 some characters enter new relationships and dynamics that were not seen during season 1, allowing for some tense, adorable, and funny memorable moments. Moreover the series' mythology is expanded, building on some aspects from the past, while bringing new demons to haunt Hawkins (Like the Big Bad). However some questions are left unanswered or unaddressed, perhaps to be dealt with during future seasons (Yes, the story allows itself to be built upon by the end). Also some issues that arise during the story are ignored completely (Especially Eleven's disdain for a specific character or the consequences of some of Dustin's decisions). Nevertheless these minor details do not detract from the experience of the story. As with last season, season 2 continues to execute the story with undeniable style and 1980's groove. With a noticeable increase on budget, the results are clearly evident. The visual effects have improved, and allow for a complexity and richness that was not possible for a debuting series. That 1980's atmosphere was visible with a myriad references and easter eggs (From posters on the wall to E.T memorabilia) to electronics, clothing and hairstyles, the setting felt real and helped me immerse into the story. Also noteworthy is the score. Besides the expected popular 1980's music used (A bit of everything from Bon Jovi to Sting and the Police to Metallica) the soundtrack produced by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein sets a great tone and serves the story well. Overall nostalgia is served and those who appreciated that aesthetic last time around will not be disappointed.Viewers from last season will know that great acting is not a stranger to the series, despite the so far short career of most of the protagonists. Eleven stands out as the character faces a wide range of struggles that demand a different set of emotions (From boredom to outrage to joy) Millie Bobby brown seems to always understand and be in command of her character with an expertise that would appear beyond her years. The character has grown and the actress with her. David Harbour as bad-ass Jim Hopper delivers another great performance as his character evolves into a somewhat different role from last season's (As he becomes close to a certain protagonist) and avoids a few devious traps his performance could have fallen into. In general the ensemble of quirky and nerdy kids delivers another stellar performance and sets the bar for future standards for child acting. ""Stranger Things 2"" delivers some great enjoyable moments and proves to be a story with spirit and emotion that allows its characters to grow while expanding on the mythology without giving it all away. Unanswered questions and inconsequential characters do not detract from a well executed story and an entertaining and captivating experience. Stranger Things retains its superior place amongst Netflix and Television Royalty."
622,"Stranger Things are what television and movies used to be about. Imagination, fun, mystery, suspense, a dash of comedy. Before youth was force fed Marvel Comic adaptation after adaptation after reboot after remake after sequel, there was seriously good, quality material to sink your chops into.Thank goodness for Netflix because without them, ""Stranger Things"" would never have gotten made. I'm so glad it did. This was a tour de Force of filmmaking, with stellar performances by Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown and a wonderfully eccentric cast of beloved misfits you embrace from the first episode. You will hear a lot of people compare it to classic 80's films The Goonies, but it's less like those films and more like what would have been created by the Masterful 80's filmmakers that created the flicks that became iconic.This series demonstrates with unapologetic glory what entertainment could be if we allowed more original content into our sphere, rather than the regurgitations and comic saturation that obliterated the blockbuster and dumbed it down to the IQ of a gnat. This is why we remember the 80's films so fondly. They were better.Star Wars was a film that changed the industry, much thanks to the young pioneer George Lucas. Following him through that gate of genius was Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemekis, Ron Howard and so many artists with stories to tell. The Duffer Brothers are a hugely welcome, long overdue addition to that club, and so is their series, ""Stranger things.""Packed with nods to yesteryear cinema, it never has to rely on sex, drugs and exploding cars to pull you in, but instead grips you with a brilliant storyline and powerful performances. It lets you have fun again, without beating you over the head with the common ""Look how much money we spent"" plague.I hope for a second series. There is no question, this is full of tomorrows biggest stars, especially Millie Bobby Brown whose turn here is mind blowing. Emmy should hand them their awards now."
623,The show is absolutely amazing it keeps you on edge as it goes i cant believe i just sat there for the hole season eyes watering and mouth open my god the suspense thank you Netflix and i hope you bring in season 2 because this show is rocking Its one of the best that i have seen in 2016 i recommend that you watch it no matter the age and don't be thrown off that its main's are children ... mind blowing.The creators have done an amazing job i recommend that more shows find originality and make you binge like so .The trailer shows things but just enough to make you see it(the show) to the full it does reveal some aspects like ESP but not nearly enough to even guess whats going on .Again congrats to the creators its marvelous a masterpiece Oscar!!- well deserved.
624,First time watching American series and it really good. Their acting are so natural and scary as well. All the lead young actors and actresses are so incredible talented
625,"The scenario looks good but this is not for a series, just for a 2 hours movie top. The action flows soooo slow I never got so bored watching a movie. Imagine a light blinking on the screen and the character takes 5 minutes to notice it. Then El could just safe 5 episode with one sentence. She just says one word each episode :))). It's the most boring series I have ever seen lately. Finally I have just watched a 5 minutes recap of each series and I am glad I didn't spent so many hours of no action."
626,"Nostalgia 10/10.
Great level of detail, fantastic atmosphere.Plot 7/10.
S1 had the best plot so far. It's kinda obvious S2 and S3 were not planned in the first place, yet they're not as bad to ruin the general charm of the series.Characters: 8.5/10.
Stereotypes with some nice character development.Product placements -2.
Absolutely polluted with product placements. Netflix doesn't show commercials so they include advertisements in the episodes? S3 is the worst so far. Multiple conversations focus completely on products."
627,"Bottom line, this show is average, by no means a waste of time but it won't be changing your life, too much hype and the rating on here is completely off."
628,"A thoroughly enjoyable romp through every eighties teen horror movie and TV show we've ever seen before. The most derivative and unoriginal series I've seen in a long time, if you've seen The Goonies, Lost Boys, ET, or any other such films then nothing in this show is new - in fact it borderline mashes these three films together and churns it out as original. Having said that is IS fun to watch, just don't expect anything ground- breaking. Probably the most over rated TV show on IMDb - clearly most of the people rating it value style of original content - but definitely fun and short enough (eight episodes) to make you feel like it isn't a waste of time."
629,"Hope you have read the official storyline.One of the most beautiful things about this story is that it is set in the 80s. Its just like watching it 30 yrs back, not something that was made now and made to look old (I hope you get what I mean). Only difference (but really appreciated), is the beautiful HD (and no grainy crap too).The characters are so reminiscent of the Enid Blyton kids who solve mysteries - their true friendship, need to help and adventurous spirit, all make you truly fall in love with them. And into this comes in a beautiful girl (not talking about prettiness), for whom you really feel love and compassion. And then there are the teenagers and adults all of whom in their own way bring out the various feelings inside us.Basically its the characters that make this show great. The good storyline, pacing, editing, etc., give these characters a solid framework to take us on an adventure. And you don't have to wait each week, forgetting the story and loosing the touch. The entire thing was released together (8 episodes, 6 hrs), so we can finish the story at a go.The story itself is quite simple - Battling alien like monsters from an alternate universe. They could have easily done a 1.5 hr movie, but this longer version is nicer because it gave us a chance to meet these interesting people and spend a longer time with them. I was really sad to see it end. The way it ended, I think there could be a 2nd season. The ending was also a little sad, and I am hoping the 2nd season may have a solution.Quality is on par with Mr.Robot, Person of Interest, etc., so I can easily recommend it to you.Hope I could give you an idea about what to expect. Cheers...PS: It is so happy to see kids who don't have ipads. Kids who loved to use their imagination and who loved to cycle out in the open over long distances. I could feel their freedom and free spirit..............."
630,"Now I am only into the second episode, and just can't see why this has a rating of 9.3. But I do get that things may still pick up and blow me away like the high ratings it has! Although I doubt it, sure it reminds me of films and series from the past, but take those facts away and you are left with kids TV, with a few cheap thrills mixed in.Now I am sure my review up to episode 2 will receive many thumbs down, but if you are an adult and measure films and series from the past against the high score of 9.3 of this so far, you can't be serious.It is a kids show, nothing more, and borrows a story line from lots of other previous films and series, and that's it so far, and just can't see why it has this high score.I will give this a 5, and will change it after another episode or 2, that's if I can last that long.5 out of 10 at episode 2.I have made it to the end of the 3rd episode, but that's it, it is just way to boring for my liking, and looks like it just borrows bits from films and series from the past. I will put this into some realistic perspective, as it sits now it has a rating sitting at that very questionable score of 9.3, let me just remind people that vote for this, the number 1 and number 2 spot of highest rated films on IMDb ever, both have a rating of 9.2! How can dribble TV like this be rated so high? Either the world has gone mad, or the ratings on here are just bogus.Now don't get me wrong, I have seen far worse than this show, but have seen far better as well, it is glossy to look at, but it seems to be purely made for teenagers. And comparing it to classics from the past as in films and series is an insult, plain and simple.I can only give this a 1 out of 10, and please keep voting my review down, as it only proves how bad this really is."
631,"The new Netflix show 'Stranger Things' is pretty much exactly what it looks like: a very loving and painstakingly recreated tribute to 80s Spielberg films in particular, and just about every teen fantasy/horror movie from that decade in general, with a soundtrack to match.There's little original about it but in this instance that's not really the point - it's more about acknowledging the magic and wonder of the best of those movies and trying to specifically recreate that in a different century in a very devoted and respectful way.It probably falls sort of true greatness because of this indebtedness, but the fact of the matter is it's just very, very nice to sink into an 8-hour cut of E.T and Close Encounters, Poltergeist, Hellraiser, Stand By Me and, uh... The Goonies that never existed before.*EDIT* I have to add, though, that the second season is awful."
632,5 is generous. So surprised and a little horrified to see a rating much higher than six!! I was extremely excited to see Winona as the lead actress but was immediately turned off by her performance. I'm sorry to say it but annoying is the only way to describe it. A definite Super 8 rip off & not nearly as well done despite what other reviewers might say. I'm 4 episodes in with 4 more to go. It's a bit like torture but I will finish watching them. I can't seem to get invested in any of the characters. Mike is OK. I saw one foreign viewer/reviewer refer to it as a masterpiece. RIDICULOUS!! Definitely not! Get real people! X-Files is a 9-10 not this piece of junk!
633,I am appalled at the Netflix trend of promoting a culture of destructive health habits in too many of its productions that are accessible to kids.....and Stranger Things is no exception ....please stop!
634,I really liked the first episodes. they really gave me chill but the rest of series got really predictable for me. I think if they didn't show a real physical figure for the alien whatsoever until the end it could be more interesting. knowing that we are dealing with! some douche carnivorous plant head aliens that are not really that scary and easily can be knocked down by kids just reduces the excitement of the series.flashbacks were not that amazing still kinda predictable. I could imagine what she had gone through in a classic 80s crazy scientists' experiments myself.Overall it was fun to watch it back to back but not really seeing the potential for this TV series to go any further for having more seasons.
635,"Nothing like watching with your 9 and 11 year old when the 2 teenagers are sleeping together sneaking out, or the 50 year old mom's mouth is watering checking out the 17 year old kid at thee pool. Season 3 blows."
636,This is just a ripoff of the Australian show called round the twist
637,"The third season has rolled down to the relationship between children, there were gays, lesbians, evil Russian and clichés...TrashMusic is not so memorable anymore.One of the advantages, the series is well filmed, big budget and cool graphics."
638,"Stranger thingsAs a forty one year old guy who grew up in the 80's this show transported me back to my childhood. A superbly crafted piece of television, Stranger things is well written with an authentic 80's feel. Without spoiling the plot the show starts off as a missing kid drama with a supernatural twist. Imagination soon runs wild as this show takes unexpected turn after unexpected turn. A sort of crossover between the Goonies, ET, the X files and a Stephen King novel. Stranger Things is truly gripping right from the opening credits with the bold red font and synthesizer theme tune. It plays like something from an old video game or 80's horror movie. There's even the white flecks that speckle across the screen just as they would on an old VHS copy. Such subtleties and attention to detail prove that the creators of this fantastic show really do care and have a true affection for 80's pop culture and the nostalgia that goes with it.The acting is fantastic, especially from the young cast. At last a group of child actors who speak and behave like real kids. There's a wonderful sense of humour here which can only be delivered with adolescence. David Harbour and Winona Ryder back up the kids as strong support but there's no denying it's the youth that steal this show. Special effects look great and production value is strong considering that this is a fairly small scale TV show. Netflix continue to knock the ball out of the park and bigger studios should stand up and take note. I for one was bowled over by Stranger things right from the very first episode. I'm really looking forward to what the Duffer brothers do with season two and where their imagination will take us all next."
639,This show sucks and is way worse than everybody says it is.
640,This show is too good. Incredible acting from all characters but especially Millie Bobby Brown and her portrayal of Eleven through facial expressions rather than dialogue. The show is amazing overall with a great nostalgic 80s theme to it. Enjoyed the music and soundtrack. I highly recommend giving it a watch.
641,This is easily one of the best series on Netflix with a clear plot and arc throughout all three seasons. Stranger Things has really loveable characters throughout the whole series who all grow and learn and the acting is really good it's Oscars worthy especially from Milly Bobby Brown who plays Eleven. Direction is really good from the Duffer Brothers.If you love the 80's you'll love this series even more with loads of refrences to movies and music from the 80's. Only negative is couple of the episodes feel out of place apart from that every episode is thrilling and exciting there is always something going on in the Hawkins town.
642,"Acting, direction and screenplay are the biggest plus points for this title. AWESOME!!!"
643,"Really, I have never felt the need nor was inspired to write a review, like, never ever, and from the height of my age and as a one that saw a lot of great productions, this one was outstanding, to say the least. There is something unique about this series that it's hard to explain... It's a mixture of different things that combines into a nothing less than pure joy and pleasure. I have binged through the whole 3 seasons in a few days w/o being able to stop...and enjoyed each and every single episode w/o any exceptions. The story, acting, visual effects, 80s atmosphere, suspense, music, jokes, rythem... I felt as if all of these were redefined in this series, resulting in an utterly overwhelming fun that kept me glued to the screen... Asking for more and more...note that English is not my mother tongue so I really having a hard time finding the right words to describe the experience... I really hope some of it managed to pass through...
THIS WAS THE BEST SERIES I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!!!"
644,My favorite show of all time it is treat to watch series like this who attach us emotionally with each and every character . Duffer brothers has done excellent job
645,"Should've ended after season one tbh.
And they cancel good shows like The OA so they can make more of this repetitive show and other crap shows no one watches."
646,Why is this series worth your time....it isnt..I have no idea why this popular....it makes no sense but it has 80s references so it must be good?...welcome to hollywood
647,"Most of the scenes are not even realistic.The kids at that time must be real ballsy.Like in season 1, nancy crawls into the upsidedown without thinking. Didnt even inform anyone. Who does that?In season 2, dustin kept a alien monster as a pet.
Steve came out from the bus to offer himself as a bait for the monster? Really?A teenager offers himself as a bait to kill the monster?This series is a joke. The only reason i continued with sesson2 is because Eleven died at the end of season 1. I wanna know what happen.I will not be continuing with season 3. This drama is ajoke.Its never great from season 1 and also season 2."
648,I wouldn't say I hate it as it has it's good sides too but overall it's a children's show.
649,"I've been a huge fan since before season 1 even came out, The first 2 seasons really had it together, good plot, nostalgic, stayed ""enough"" within the lines of reality to make it believable, and most of all, left you itching for more. Season 3 for the most part was very predictable and unrealistic, I mean if you look at the bigger picture they all follow the same theme and you can get a general idea of what is going to happen, but the way it's portrayed makes a big difference. Rabid rats and people that just seem to explode, throwing fireworks at the monster, like I was expecting the military to show up and blow it up or something. I'm just not putting everything together. I really REALLY think the whole Russian/Soviet aspect could have been really cool given the tensions between the US and the USSR, but so much detail was left out and pshhhh the Soviets having that much of a presence on American soil, get real! What was the purpose of their research besides opening the gate up again, it seems that they had no clue that this monster was raging above them? And then the suddenly all disappeared. I got the vibe that ""well, Hawkins lab has been played out, how about the Russians! You know, let's shake it up?"" I think if they had expanded their horizons to incorporate some of the story over in Russia, it would have been much more believable and add depth to the story. Billy being the main host was an unexpected surprise as for the most part I thought he was just going to fizzle out. All in all, it was decent, good acting, soundtrack, filming, I just feel like it all could have been tied in much better to add a little more realism here and there, not a bombardment of out of this word stuff."
650,I've become a TV snob in the golden age of television but Stranger Things is as good as it gets. What an amazing show
651,"I've never had a serious enough negative reaction to an actor to feel a need to comment. It can be a tough job regardless of the money. But in this case, Winona Ryder is just spoiling this show for me."
652,WHOOOOOO! This show is the best show of the decade. Must watch. No spoilers form me (except the headline). Just watch it now. Why are you still reading this? Watch it.
653,I didn't know what to expect from this but I was immediately hooked!! It kinda reminded of a Stephen king or Dean Koontz book.. I watched from episode 3 to the end of the second series in one go!! Don't hesitate watch this now!! You won't regret it!! Just finished series 3 and it's amazing sad at the end
654,"Cinematography: All of the scenes are filmed very well, the Red Dragon really shines here. Definitely made for a 4k TV. The CGI is really good and the old Film effect really helps with the atmosphere. Cast: The cast really makes this show special. The kids are some of the best child actors i have ever seen.Story: The story is very different from many other story lines, and it always surprised me. F.ex. Not the typical Lovestory with the Hero saving the girl and then becoming her boyfriend and rather a story about the hero then helping her even more and becoming some sort of friends. it doesn't get boring.The Soundtrack: It is awesome. I really don't understand the bad Reviews, watched the show in one day straight."
655,"If you haven't watched Stranger things yet watch it now!Seriously do not read anything about. Just watch it by yourself. But be careful! Next 8 hours of your life will be filled by watching this show. But it's worth it! You'll find a lot of references to Spielberg's movies, works of Stephen King, Lynch.Everything is on the high level: the plot, the montage, the music, the acting (This is the best part!). Young actors literally stunned me, especially Millie Bobby Brown.If you feel nostalgia about 80's and your childhood, if you like adventures and mystery, if deep in your mind you are the same kid, you'll enjoy it.Do you really want to see the rate?11/10"
656,"Netflix did it again with Stranger Things. It's a very pleasant and easy to follow series to watch. It's like a time warp back to the eighties. A mixture of The Goonies meets The X-Files meets Close Encounters Of A Third Kind. I watched the whole first season in just a couple days. You immediately get hooked on this show. I don't know if the makers will add another season to it and if they do I'm already very curious what it will be about. Will it be a complete other story or will it just continue where the first season ended? It doesn't matter to me, I just want more seasons like this one. The cast is very good. All the actors fit perfectly well in the story. There is enough suspense to keep you interesting all the time. Watch this one, you won't regret it."
657,"The constant presence of Carpenter's bloodthirsty monster, the Spielberg-esque children-vs-monsters-while-the-government-is-chasing- them story, and the 1980s vibe synth-pop are the base ingredients for this fun, gripping TV show. Nicely done characters in set of the 80s with synth-pop is already a good sign for a great show, top it with brilliant atmosphere, fantastic special effects and David Harbour (who does a really good job as the local chief officer) and you get the best show of the summer! I recommend it to everyone who loved 'The Goonies', 'The Thing', 'E.T.', and loved to play 'Half-Life'. You all going to enjoy this fantastic piece of web series!"
658,You'll have a better time watching an actual 80's movie than this overrated garbage.
659,Is it bad? No. Is it great? No. Is it mediocre? Almost.The first season was entertaining but lazy pastiche. I enjoyed it when it came out but I could never understand the excessive praise for the show.Season two was when it died for me.
660,"Very pleasant surprise. Netflix and Duffer bros pretty much nailed it. An elaborate and hard working homage to John Carpenter, Spielberg, Raimi, Stephen King and other horror-adventure masters of the 70's and 80's that also stands on it's own legs.While Stranger Things does lack sometimes finely timed emotional punch and doesn't go full escalation in some cases, it still blinds with quality. From atmosphere to music, nice story, good characters and damn fine actors, this Netflix show is a great viewing.I'm not going to spoil anything, story is interesting and if show's synopsis here is not enough for you, then you'll just have to check the show for yourself. It does play with some sci-fi/horror standards, sometimes diving in completely, sometimes defying them but almost always is treating it's story and legacy with respect. Yes, it is a bit of nostalgia-bate but it uses that as an advantage and not cheap gimmick, which I find important to make it more distinct from other projects that solely bank on cheap nostalgic tricks.I'm totally recommending it and hoping that we'll get Season 2 or something similar."
661,"Right at the beginning - is this a good show? Yes. Is this the best thing since sliced bread? No. I don't think that the show deserves so much praise as it gets. There's almost a pathological sense of nostalgia nowadays and I would ascribe a lot of the series success to it's setting in the 80's. The feeling of the ""good old days"" is so abundant in the audience that they'll swallow pretty much anything with the retro vibe and continue to ask for more. So, let's put off those nostalgia glasses and be realistic. The series deserves praise for the execution since it's good enough to keep you engaged and make you binge watch the whole season. On the other hand, so many things have already been seen in other movies/series that there's no sense of originality (at least for me). If you are a long term fan of the genre, there's almost nothing new to see here. But if you're a newcomer, this will be a nice initiation into this type of movies/series and hopefully it will encourage you to dig deeper and find all the other works that inspired this one. For the beginning start with the one I've put in the tittle. Happy hunting."
662,"OMG! I just watched the entire season in one sitting. It was so much fun! I won't spoil anything but Bro this was just into another level. The acting and the story was so good. The music of 80 was still on point! If you haven't watched the show, I HIGHLY suggest to give it a try!"
663,"Extremely overrated and full of plot holes if you examine it too closely, The main girl child actor is NOT as good as everyone says, i find her actually very untalented. Also the whole show has a ""disneyified"" feel where nothing's actually scary or dark but light-hearted and silly"
664,"I just finished watching 2nd season and I cannot take this crap anymore. I am not a 'Review Person' but this thing was so mind F**K that I had to write. What the hell is wrong with people, how is this 9/10 It was a kid's series all along, I literally felt like we are going back in evolution if we like this. Why would someone make this! and not only that how can this get 9/10, did the owner do some sorta black magic, god I still cant believe!!!"
665,"Surprisingly old school in the most annoying ways, with rather little action this time. There's fat shaming (supposed to be funny); there's some animal suffering with indifference on the part of the characters; there's sexism, harassment, verbal abuse, plus the clichés of female characters using 'girl problems' as an excuse, and being pointlessly manipulative. Ugh. There's an overemphasis on attraction/romance. There's anti-adult conspiring/snottiness. The cigarette smoking is frequent, unnecessary & gross.
For male friends, apologies that express understanding come immediately from other males.
For female friends, if apologies come at all, they come with denials, excuses, and dodging from males.
This season felt a little tired and lazy in terms of writing/plot."
666,"I just finished watching the show I don't really regret however I'm mad cause the all the three season were basically the same!!. Same plot. I liked the first season the second was entertaining although it was the same plot as i said and then the third one made me so maadddd it was the same. And what's with the killing? Why did they killed bob and the Russian guy were they trying to make things realistic and logical? Cause that just made it seem stupid since the others were somehow ""immune"" to death. Anyway did someone noticed that hopper was shooting at the Russians using one hand only? I mean come on what kind of logic is this. I swear to god making a fourth season is a big mistake but I'm watching for dustin, steve, robin, and erica."
667,"Season 1 was really cool, season 2 was alright and then season 3 came which unfortunately is terrible."
668,"Nothing else to say but great cast, excellent graphics for TV, great musical tie ins and a fat Sean Astin!
Not only is the show launching these young people's careers, it is reviving careers that have been dormant for a while. I'm very happy to see that.
Just binged season two again in anticipation of season 3. Can't wait!!"
669,"1. Usual cheap hook of young teens facing bullies (stereotypically always bigger & meaner looking). Script designed for the mostly under 15 audience so main actors fit into that category w/usual mix of behaviors, genders, character types (nerds, athletes), race mix.
2. Lots of filming goofs (e.g. kitchen lights go out, but are on in next scene; 3 kids riding bikes; they all fall off; bikes disappear in next scene) which indicate to me little creative oversight + cheap production.
3. Over reliance on the age old human fears of things different. Always an us vs. them; same vs. not same mentality. Large spidery thingies; parasitic worms w/large mouth & many teeth; dark underground tunnels w/creeping vines to entangle you; lots of darkness.
4. More of the same old corporate/government power ethos of experimenting on people to create super anything.
5. Not creative dumbing down of super psychic abilities such as the overused & tiresome hook of controlling people's minds (don't we wish), and even more so control matter (amusingly w/out stretched hands w/screaming tossed in to represent painful effort). Neither one of which would get a passing grade from any half way intelligent middler schooler.
Conclusion: Too much of a repeat of plot, character done many times before. F for creative writing. Passable grade if under 15 yrs old."
670,this was the best show ever IF YALL NEED AN EXTRA PERSON I'm here i have been in drama since fourth grade and now I'm in 7th and still doing it I'm 13 and this is her grandson Gavin. the last episode was sad cause something happened but 11 she was legit and she was pretty lit and everyone else was so awesome i don't spoil the shows put have a another season if y'all need anyone I'm here for the job but this show was pretty cool so yea thanks for the amazing show everyone of ya'll did an amazing job picking out who they want but i'm not rating this a 10 more like a 20 cause they did an excellent job doing this show please have another season come on because i was sad because there was only 1 season. hold up there is a lot of people being still w.righter is not stupid at all are world has turned into evil but everyone is amazing for real .
671,"First time reviewer here at IMDb but I had to write a review to say how much I enjoyed this show. In my opinion, it's far and away the best series so far from Netflix, surpassing Making a Murderer as my favorite original Netflix production.Stranger Things was not overly hyped by Netflix, and with 'stars' like Winona Ryder, Matthew Modine and David Harbour, it's not a production featuring many of today's hotter Hollywood actors and actresses. Throw in a rather small budget in terms of sets and special effects, and it's safe to say that I did not have big expectations for this show upon watching the first episode.But from the very first 10 minutes of the superb first episode, the show drags you in and won't let you go. Eight episodes in all, the middle few episodes perhaps drag on a bit, but episodes 1-3, and 7-8 in particular are stunners.The basic premise is a young boy goes missing amidst a series of very bizarre (and at times scary) events in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. Ryder is the young boy's distraught mom. Harbour is the well-intending local sheriff who is trying to figure out just what in the heck is happening in his small town. Modine is the creepy scientist in charge of some weird experiments that the top- secret Department of Energy complex is conducting (why they are based in the middle of Indiana is never quite explained).The whole series takes place in the winter of 1983, and as someone who was still a teenager in that era, I can vouch that the costumes, props and look of every episode is spot on. It frequently pays homage to movies from that era such as ET, The Thing, Stephen King horror films and books, as well as newer movies that also took on a similar theme (Super 8).But while Super 8 ultimately disappointed me with a poor ending and acting that never drew you in, Stranger Things succeeds with strong writing from start to finish, and actors who you truly sympathize with and feel empathy for. The series is carried by the young actors, who across the board are great whether they are portraying heroes, nerds or creeps. Topping the production was Millie Bobby Brown as the supernatural heroine Eleven. She is going to be a future star in Hollywood, mark my words. The four young actors playing her friends (and Will, the boy they are trying to save) are also solid but not quite as memorable. After Eleven, my favorite two performers were Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler, a teenage girl trying to come to terms with her sexuality and maturity; and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers, Will's weird older brother who is trying to keep his family sane in a very tragic situation. Dyer could easily pass for Mia Sara's daughter. Heaton looks he could be Bill Hader's son.Kudos too to the Duffer Brothers for keeping the production moving along at a brisk level. And while the series wraps up with a mostly positive ending, there are just a few hints thrown out at the end to suggest that Stranger Things may still be in store in the future of poor Hawkins, Indiana.So if you're a fan of Stephen King, early 1980's tributes, and science fiction, give Stranger Things a chance. You'll be very happy you did."
672,"10/10 Being an 80's kid I loved the setting of this. Giant walkie talkies, 80's jeans (don't miss those!), cycling everywhere with your friends. I loved that everything was 80' even the title and credit fonts, the theme tune that also features in parts of the episodes is fun and mysterious. Casting is excellent which is commendable considering there are many child actors involved. I love the idea of this story showing the kids perspective also. What I love in a series too is when there is a cliffhanger the mystery is opened up in the following episode rather than dragging out story lines for the sake of a longer season. however I also would have been quite happy with a few more episodes as I enjoyed it so much. Can't wait for season 2."
673,"All the previous reviews have said it all: Great, constant '80s nostalgia references, great fun but at the same time truly troubling and terrifying, great acting and storytelling. Yeah, the first episode overdoes the '80s allusions a little, and the Chief is a little over the top as a dorky wastrel, and the kids can be a little TOO kid-ish, but still you have to watch the second episode, and by then you're hooked, and the binge is on.Great, engrossing fun all the way, constant action, some great acting, especially from Winona Ryder, tender-hearted, wise, and doesn't talk down to the audience. Btw, the first binge for my wife and me--we just couldn't stop!"
674,"A glorious retro romp featuring a hugely likeable cast and a stellar performance from Winona Ryder
It's a rollercoaster coming of age drama that never has a dull moment
Suitable for all ages to enjoy, it'll make you laugh and pull at your heart strings...the music is pretty good too"
675,"I really watched all of ST during COVID19.My first watch of season 3 was like meh, ok...Second watching, I'm like woah hadn't expected that!"
676,"Keep Seeing On Internet About How Much Great The Series Is, First Season Set In 1980s Fictional Small Indiana Town, Let's See What Happens Next"
677,"I just rewatched all three seasons for the fourth time. I pick up on new things everytime. If you havent seen this show, you are missing out. I absolutely love the story, acting, tensions between characters, David Harbour and this is the first show I've ever liked Winona Ryder."
678,"This is my favorite series.
the actors are good. and the whole story is very exciting and interesting"
679,"Very good series. Original, thrilling and full of action. Some great acting performances and some good chemistry between characters. The third series felt a bit of the same in places but was still really good, I think they need to end it next series with a good ending and it will be one of the best series of all time if they can do that."
680,Everything is good! Waiting for more seasons!!!!!!!!!!!!!
681,"Is there anything more enjoyable than chasing the strange story third season at home on the fourth day of the summer vacation ... If so, please tell me!"
682,"Time for the baby boomers to relive period of 80's Pop culture and millennials to have a sneak peak of their aging parents' choices of dresses, music, fashion, games and movies (likes of Back to the future)...It took me to my fav days of my life..... it's for fans of films of Spielberg like ET, Close Encounter of the Third Kind, or Gremlins etc. and music of Cyndi Lauper, Duran Duran, Huey Lewis, Wham, Madonna etc...Rest is all fine intermixed with alien looking monsters, horror, thriller, comedy, romance, emotions, drama etc....Enjoyed"
683,"This show has tons of fans for a reason. The perfectly depicted 80s setting, the amazing CGI, the interesting characters, the well done action scenes. It's a recipe for something amazing! Stranger Things explores a mystery of government cover up, supernatural monsters, and alternate dimensions. It is a really fascinating show. Eleven is an outstanding character and the acting from Millie Bobby Brown is stupendous. This show made me feel like a kid again, hunting monsters and escaping danger. It's just so exciting!"
684,"The title is Strangers Things, the genre is horror, drama. The country of origin is the United States of America. This series has 3 season with 25 episodes. In 1983, in Hawkins, in Idiana, Will Byers, a young boy of twelve, suddenly disappeared. Police chief Jim Hopper is set to investigate the controversial MKULTRA project at the Hawkins National Laboratory for the Departement of Energy (DOE), wich appears to be the cause of the appearance of supernatural phenomena. This series is really cool it is scary ans suprising at the same time it is also mysterious. I give im 10 of 10 beacause I love this series."
685,"Season 3 is your regular stereotypical Hollywood crap. Same old story loops, multiple plots for different characters kind of feeling forced. Too much of forced emotions & comedy makes it dull. I don't like how the season 3 has been made more commercial rather than a plot that makes sense."
686,"Season 1&2 are amazingly engaging. Writing, wonderfully done storyline, every emotion and mind-blowing action and screenplay and take anything, all are one hundred percent cohesive.
But donno what happened to season 3, Duffer brothers did an utterly poor job on that one.
Hopefully they take it on top again in final season.
Please don't let it end like GOT pleazzzzz."
687,"It's 2019, but watching this feels like it's 1969. When we can't find another psychopath American scientist to be the bad guy, why don't we get some evil Russian, so that we can make the them dumb as hell? The Russians are ridiculously stupid like they are in a cartoon for kids. Seriously, a high school graduates and a sheriff beat up USSR soldier armed with AK rifle? What's the difference between this kinda story and a North Korean movie 50 years ago?"
688,"Season 1 & 2 are fantastic = 10. Exciting, entertaining, Great cast, cool other dimensions and monsters.
Season 3 is somewhat disappointing, but still deserves 7. Or maybe 6,5... WHY are the russians opning the hole again? Anybody?"
689,"Season 1: 9/10
Season 2: 7/10
Season 3: 5/10Suffers from what many series suffer from: sequel syndrome and riding the success of earlier seasons to make more $$$."
690,"The Duff Brothers' have done most things right with their Netflix hit ""Stranger Things"". The 80s setting is great, the vibe is just right, it's one of those old school coming of age adventures that everybody loves. The cast choices are also brilliant, with Weaver, Harbour, and Bobby Brown making great performances in paritcular. My only objection, it's not much, is that the story sometimes feels a bit repetitive. There's nothing wrong having the threat from the Upsidesown recur through all seasons but sometimes the culminations and cliffhangers comes across as already used. Nevertheless, ""Stranger Things"" is a show with an awesome production value, suspense, and wonderful characters."
691,I just cannot recommend this show enough! It's so good and so addicting!
692,"This was the first show I watched when I got Netflix back in January of 2019 and I was not disappointed. I had heard about this show from some friends and family and thought that I'd watch it to see if it was as good as they made it out to be. It was better.Let's talk about my first impressions. I started Episode 1 and was immediately hooked into the eeriness of the lab. The 80s vibes that are created whilst the kids are playing D&D and riding their bikes are so good to feel and throughout all of that, ""Kids"" from the soundtrack is playing (more on the music later) and the feel you get from that song is incredible. After Will vanishes and the title card and theme starts playing, I was astonished. Never had I seen a theme and card so fitting for a show and the it really creates an 80s mystery/horror atmosphere. I have watched both seasons 3 times and I have not once skipped the intro.Personally, I prefer Season 2, which, after seeing many reviews, I know is not the general opinion. I believe that Season 1 has a better narrative flow but if you took out Episode 7 of Season 2 then everything else is perfect. My favourite episodes of the series are Season 2 episodes 6, 8 and 9 and before I explain why, MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD. Chapter Six: The Spy carries on from where the previous episode finished and, in my opinion, it contains some of the best acting and scenes of the whole show. The scenes with Dustin and Steve were incredibly well-written and the scene when ""Soldiers"" (from the soundtrack) starts playing, is possibly one of my favourite scenes of the entire show. Chapter 8 and 9 show how to perfectly conclude all of the events of all the previous episodes. Bob's sacrifice is very emotionally because he is such a likeable character and Eleven's return is such an epic moment. The VFX of Chapter 9 are incredible and the closing scene at the Snowball sets up some elements for Season 3. I saw an excellent point somewhere before about how if you like ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" you should like Season 2 because the way the events play out are similar in both.I want to talk a bit about Season 2, Chapter 7: The Lost Sister, since this seems to be the most hated episode of the entire series. I do agree that this is the worst episode of the series but in reality, it does need to exist; maybe not as a solo episode but the events of the episode and the backstory provided are extremely necessary towards Eleven's character development. Despite this, the acting in the episode from everyone but Millie Bobby Brown is disappointing considering what we had already seen from the show and the script is so weirdly written and the dialogue was awkward. If this episode was taken out of the series, the show would not work but I do believe that this could have been a much better episode.Moving on to the cast. I believe that this show has one of the best main ensembles of any show in existence and Carmen Cuba did such a good job with the Duffers when picking the cast. Season 1 showed some incredible acting from Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard and Matthew Modine, who I believe is extremely under appreciated by a lot of people. I would definitely say that MBB had the best acting in Season 1 but then in Season 2, we see more of Will Byers, and therefore more of Noah Schnapp's acting is displayed and my God, he is good. I am not surprised that he won the MTV Movie + TV ""Most Frightened Performance"" award. We also see some notable 80s stars throughout the show like Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Matthew Modine, Sean Astin and Paul Reiser.Finally, I'm going to talk about some other elements. To start with: the soundtrack. Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein's music for this series is exceptional and I even have quite a few of the pieces from the show on my main playlist. I've had some of the music playing around people who have never watched the show and they still believe that the music is great. I don't think the show would be as good as it is without their composition. Some notable tracks are Stranger Things, Kids, Lay-Z-Boy, No Weapons, She'll Kill You, Eulogy and Soldiers. The other soundtrack contains popular songs of the 80s and the choices for the songs are perfect. Tim Ives's cinematography is also incredible and everything else is incredible as well.To conclude, I believe that this show is objectively one of the greatest shows ever created and it deserves the credit it gets for being such a good series. Another Netflix Original I watched shortly after this called ""The Umbrella Academy"" and I believe that compared to Stranger Things, TUA show is a bit of a mess (I might do a full review at another date.) Anyone who is a fan of the 80s and/or anyone who grew up in the 80s will definitely appreciate this show and anyone who is a fan of Steven Spielberg's work during the 80s or will also love this show. I cannot wait until Season 3, and I will update my review after I have watched it.My Ratings:
Characters/Cast - 9/10 (If it weren't for S02E07, this would be 10)
Plot - 10/10
Dialogue - 9/10 (If it weren't for S02E07, this would be 10)
Visuals - 9.5/10
Music - 10/10
Direction - 10/10
Overall - 10/10"
693,This show does an excellent job at making the kids really act like kids! Far too often we find movies and TV shows making kids out to be genius or completely useless. These kids responded to most of these situations as kids really would have I believe. Overall the story progresses nicely and the characters are wonderful! I hope to see more from this fantastic series as we find out more about Eleven's past. Hopefully they will present this information in a better way than the one episode throw away in season two with the street gang. The relation to the D&D concepts is a great way to make a lot of syfy stuff easy to understand. It also gives the platform for the kids to explain things to the adults in the series all the while it explains the creature or actions to the viewers. Overall this has been an amazing series. We have discussed a lot shows like Stranger Things on our YouTube channel All Tower Media. Get over and check us out for more thoughts on all sorts of films/shows.
694,"What if in 1983, Steven Spielberg is given a new Steven King novel, with an adapted script written by John Carpenter and then makes a for-TV- miniseries. ￼ The result could be Stranger Things. This Netflix TV show turned out to be the blockbuster of Summer 2016, better than any of the feature films coming out in theaters. It is genuinely scary, finding new and interesting ways to tap into our deep fears.For some reason, there's a 30-year rotation for pop-culture. In the 1980's there was a fascination with the 1950's.David Harbour is a revelation as the tortured town sheriff who must get his act together to solve the big mysteries of Stranger Things. How did they know he was meant to play this character? Give a casting executive a raise!Millie Bobby Brown pulls off the kind of performance that launched Haylie Joel Osment into superstardom after The Sixth Sense. She has an ability to evoke emotions that a child her age shouldn't understand.READ my full review of Season 1: https://wademann.net/television/stranger- things/Season 2 picks up a year later. It figures that a show as self-aware of its derivative nature as Stranger Things 2 would blow the sequel conventions up to the 'enth degree.There is a difference between 1983 and '84. and a show this smart about 80's culture would know the difference. It may have something to do with Reagan-era prosperity spreading. 1984 is a sunnier period, where bad things take on a more epic scope.It's been said that the Duffer Brothers were inspired by James Cameron's Aliens, the ultimate sequel. Eleven now sports a short curly head of hair like Sigourney Weaver's. Paul Rudd's presence as the head scientist and government sell-out is a not so subtle reference to his Aliens character. And although the casting of Goonies alum, Sean Astin as Bob Newby, is a bit on the nose, it's hard to argue with the fact that using Sean Astin in your show always makes it better.READ my full review of Season 2: https://wademann.net/television/stranger- things/season-2/"
695,"The first season was pretty much an epitome of everything that made the 80s desirable and cool for a lot of people. Sure, it created its own universe but most of the elements were taken from other things (among them such very not 80s shows such as Elfen Lied - the whole Eleven story was based on it). However, it was cool and enjoyable. But the story (because of said taken elements) for the most part was a mess. Well, it didn't become much clearer in the second season, but everything else, just holy sh!t, has gained a level. The characters in the first season actually grew as characters and are much more likable than the first time. The performances are all top notch, but someone - and I can't stress this enough - is just above everyone else. Millie Bobby Brown's Eleven is a spectacle and a scene-stealer, everything she's in she totally steals the show. She's alone just worth watching the whole series. Her side story may not please everyone but I think it was important in her quest to become more ""human"". Watch this show if you are a 80s junkie - it has all, the hairs, the music, the setting, the references, the MUSIC, the video games, the movies, the MUSIC! But more importantly, watch this show if you want something good, something enjoyable, likable characters, great set-pieces, a good sci-fi horror setting and action. It has a lot more action than the first season. The only thing that's missing...well, find it out yourself."
696,"Im a big fan of horror movies between late 80's and the beginning of 90's. And what is can say about the horror movies from the last 20years is... ""that horror movies are unwatchable"". But this Stranger Things give back that old horror movie feeling what is missing from the new ones. Big thanks for the Duffer brothers! :) I hope you guys making at least 10 season! :)"
697,"I could probably nitpick, but why bother, this is about as near perfect as film gets.I just call this ""film"", because traditional ""box office"" is dead. Cable (and apparently Netflix) is where motion picture entertainment is at. Box office just serves superhero comics and pseudo-artsy, vapid star appearances. ""Oooh, Leonardo DiCaprio has a beard, that sounds interesting!"". No, thank you, Hollywood.But there was a time when Hollywood was awesome, and Stranger Things extracts all that awesomeness, makes it fresh again, and presents it in a modern, appropriate format. With so many classic influences (I wont try to re-list all of them), it sound like it would be a mess of different genres, but it all really works perfectly together with this story and sci-fi-ish angle. I was expecting something convoluted, but the plot is straightforward and well-explained.The kids were so much better than the usual kid characters. Dustin was funny. 011 was serious (as someone waiting my whole life for a live-action Akira movie, this character gave me goosebumps). Luke reminded me of all my 80's childhood friends who aspired to be action heroes. And, as a side note - most movies today where you have characters of different races, they always have to have some banter acknowledging some racial tension - remember the 80s, when we didn't feel the need for that crap? Winona Ryder is criticized for being too this or too that - but this was a difficult role to play as a character experiencing things nobody can relate to. I thought she did awesome. The Chief of Police perfectly transitions from a typical, believable cop into an action hero you have to root for.It felt like this script was probably intended for a box-office movie, but they decided two hours is just not enough time to tell the story. Im glad it was made in the format it was, it was just perfect. So perfect, in fact, that I'm not looking forward to how they're going to ruin this masterpiece with a season 2. It is a complete story, and I don't feel the need for continuation. But, it looks like they know what they're doing, and I'll end up watching it either way."
698,"When it comes down to 'Stranger Things' I'm in a bit of a conundrum. Never before has a show managed to hit all elements of what people value as entertainment. This TV Show has humor, it has horror, it has mystery, it has one hell of a soundtrack, it has many moments of nostalgia, it has amazing acting (especially from the younger cast which is a nice change), it has amazing visuals, it has sad moments as well as shocking ones -but most of all it has heart. There is a theme of love that's evident across the shows run, whether it's the persistent love Joyce Byers has for her son that allows her to keep on searching for him against all odds or the love of friendship that causes our three protagonists to put themselves in danger in order to be reunited with their friend. The last scene says it all but also the connection and the undefinable love between Mike and Eleven. Also, credit to the writers for creating such interesting characters. Each one felt they had deserved their screen time. Hopper again is brilliant as we never really know his motives but we again root for his happiness. Nancy's story-line felt too separate at the start but it really blended in well with the story and gave the viewers a taste of adolescent life during the 80s. It was nice to see such empowering female leads – each one felt strong and determined but no more than the real highlight of the show, Eleven. The character of Eleven is probably one of the smartest moves Netflix has ever done. They have managed to make one of the most complex characters on television with barely any dialogue. There is constant empathy felt for Eleven. You can tell from her expression that her childhood had been stripped from her life. She is separate from the world but we still manage to connect with her in an emotional way. Like ET, there innocence and circumstance leads us to worry and care about them as time goes on. The last part of the show is one of the most heart-breaking moments of television I've seen – but it all highlights one of the shows prominent themes – love. Also if Millie Brown isn't nominated for an Emmy alongside Winona, I'll lose my faith in the awards system. Age shouldn't be a hinder and if anything she has shown it shouldn't be correlated with skill – putting to shame many of Hollywood's actors. This show is weird, but in a unique way. It would be hard to compare a show like this to that of 'Game of Thrones' or 'Breaking Bad'. It is very much its own thing, taken the styles of some of the best 80s movies to create one golden piece of entertainment. Get ready to experience many different types of emotions within 6 hours. I do hope there is another season however, even if there isn't – this show is worthy to stand on just this one for repeated viewings. I hope this will be a classic for newer generations so they can experience the emotions and feelings found uniquely within the 80s. But I've taken up too much of your time already – just go and watch it."
699,"It inevitably seems a little silly to pile on the accolades for ""Stranger Things,"" Netflix's well-crafted long-form horror/mystery/adventure TV show, but I can't really help myself. It didn't take long after getting into the first episode to sense what seemed like ""Stranger Things"" main set of cues: JJ Abrams' well done homage to '70s-'80s era Steven Spielberg sci-fi/alien movies, ""Super 8."" There are a number of similarities between ""Stranger Things"" and ""Super 8"": A cluster of really tight male best friends; a central activity that they focus on (D&D vs. Movie-making), a small Midwestern town, a sheriff, a girl, and a vast government conspiracy that involves a supernatural monster.Stylistically they're also not that different, but where ""Super 8"" wasn't really allowed because of time constraints to expound as deeply on its thematic elements, ""Stranger Themes"" as kind of a long-form TV novel, has room to range on its big themes: the '80s, the supernatural, horror elements (though not overdone), and crazy government experiments and conspiracies gone awry. ""Stranger Things"" also focuses more tightly on the darker supernatural ""horror"" elements, but in a manner that is much softer than the ""torture porn""-type intensity of today's horror films (though intense horror films have been around since at least the '70s of course). If anything it seems comparatively tame. The first season story arc without giving too much away is about peeling away the onion, so to speak, of the real goings on of a secret government lab - yep - just outside of town. Matthew Modine plays a charismatic, shadowy central role as the lab's head. As the series moves along we learn more and more about the lab and what's really going on there. The disappearance of Will Byers - one of the members of this cluster of friends - in the first episode opens a series of questions that have to be answered throughout the story to find what - or who - happened to young Will. All the actors are quite good - young and old, but David Harbour as the small-town sheriff with a past Jim Hopper is certainly the best in terms of total characterization. Winona Ryder as the somewhat crazed and manic mother of Will and older brother Jonathan who loses her son to - no one really knows yet - is a good fit. Her voice and mannerisms work well for a mother that is on the frayed edges of sanity after losing her son to forces that seem too bizarre to reconcile with anything remotely resembling normal circumstances. The cast of young boys are all great, with the lispy friend Dustin played by Gaten Mattazaro as the most stand-out and lovable loyal live-and-die friend of the group. Millie Brown as the escaped lab patient ""Eleven"" is also fantastic in her own way and has very pure acting instincts. If she stays with it as a career, it should be a long one for such a young and precociously gifted actor. It's hard to talk about the strength of the story and general plot without giving too much away. Suffice it to say ""Stranger Things"" follows a fairly predictable plot, mixing together ample government conspiracies with darkly supernatural elements and, perhaps best of all, a monster from a creepy parallel universe temporarily attached to our present reality. The '80s synth intro and even neon-like lettering of the series title was a seductive draw for children of the '80s like me (well I was born in 1970 but obviously grew up in the '80s too). It seems clear the creators played on this bit of nostalgia without getting too heavy-handed about it - there's ample pop culture references throughout. Ultimately the story, direction, and characters shine and their ability to maintain a strong story line and focus that sucks you in from one episode to the next (yes, we binge-watched it in 2 sittings over 2 days) is typical of modern streaming TV series that I enjoy like ""Stranger Things,"" ""Longmire,"" and ""Bosch."" (among others). Like a good book, ""Stranger Things"" is hard to put down. If for some crazy reason you haven't seen it, you will certainly enjoy it."
700,"I had heard good things about it and decided to watch a few minutes of the first episode earlier this week. After 4 full episodes I decided to call it a night, yes it's that good.If I had to find negatives about it I'd have to say that there are a few minor science mistakes like when one of the kids is following his compass that he's mounted right on a walkie-talkie near the speaker that has a magnet on it. Other than that the acting was magnificent, specially by Millie Bobby Brown that deserves an Emmy for her role as Eleven. Seriously she is a prodigal child actor that I'm already looking forwards to seeing in other productions much like I'm looking forwards to seeing more of Jacob Tremblay.And then there's the soundtrack. Candy for the ears, not quite as good as the soundtrack from Turbo Kid (incredible) but not far off."
701,"This series ticked all the boxes for me, and I can't praise it (or creative geniuses that are the Duffer brothers) highly enough. It's like they took everything you love about movies, TV shows, and books from the 1980's, mashed them all together, added their own origin spin on things, and came up with perfection. The setting is late 1983, and everything from the clothing right down to the toys, feels as if you are really watching something filmed back then – well except the picture and sound are 2016 quality thank god! Genre wise, it's pretty much a mix of everything – sci-fi, horror, supernatural, mystery, fantasy, romance, drama, coming-of-age, and comedy, meaning there's something in there for everyone to enjoy. I wouldn't class it as a family series, but I think that if your kids can make it through the Harry Potter movies without being terrified, then this show would be about the same level of scariness.The acting is flawless, particularly from the young cast. Because of this you instantly grow to love (and care about what happens to) all the characters, from the moment they appear on screen. As a long term fan of Winona Ryder, I had no doubt that she'd be fantastic, and she didn't disappoint. Both the soundtrack (Peter Gabriel, Toto, Foreigner, New Order, and The Clash to name a few), as well as the original musical score (think John Carpenter's Halloween) composed by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein are superb.Think I'll go and watch it again. 10/10."
702,"I can't thank a friend of mine enough for recommending ""Stranger Things"" on Netflix!! My life is richer for having seeing this gem of a series. It is perfection -- a real labor of love that pays homage to the Sci-fi, suspense, and horror genres that we all enjoyed from the '80s. The story line, writing, acting, characterizations, and score are brilliant beyond belief. And David Harbour (who played the minor, but memorable role of Randall Malone for Ang Lee in ""Brokeback Mountain"") is a revelation. I see him as the next Harrison Ford -- he certainly could play Ford's son (kind of sounds like him, too). Watch this if you haven't!!!"
703,"This series is the power of Netflix at its finest! No need for 24 episodes, monster-of-the-week episodes, etc. Just 8 episodes of great storytelling, of a self-contained story, pretty much what anyone wants! Everything is great here, the pacing, the actors are FANTASTIC! the kids are darn impressive especially Eleven! Plus, the way it is filmed is beautiful, giving unusual shots you wouldn't usually see in a TV series. Great music! Yes it's an homage to the 80's cinematography (and music and games), but it's an original story in this world of remakes, sequels, etc. I hope this series is a great commercial success and will convince Netflix to keep going that way and giving unusual projects a shot. If you're a fan of sci-fi, fantasy, horror or the 80's or none of the above watch this! My brother is not in the least interested by any of that stuff, can't fathom what Dungeons & Dragons is about and was hooked on this series. Way to go Netflix"
704,"""Stranger Things"" perfectly encapsulates everything I loved about my childhood cinema experiences. There have been plenty of contemporary films that have tried to capture the feel of the 80s and for a long time I didn't know if it was personal bias, lack of fresh ideas, or just a jadedness that comes with adulthood, but none of them ever managed to hit their mark with me. That is until now. I loved stranger things and am not embarrassed to say that I consumed the entire series in less than two days. Think of it as a healthy combination of the Goonies, Explorers, Fire Starter, and E.T. in all their adventurous wonder and you have a nostalgic concoction that works."
705,"Stranger Things seems to have come out of nowhere, I had never heard of it right up until they released the trailer last month. So if you didn't know, Stranger Things is a Netflix original series created by The Duffer Brothers and is set in 1983 Indiana where a young boy goes missing in a small town where strange things are happening and an unusual girl shows up. So right away, this setting is genius. I never lived in the 80s but after this I really feel as though I was there, they didn't bang you over the head with it shoving pop culture references at you every minute but just how they dressed, their hair, the posters on a bedroom wall, it all seemed so natural and not gimmicky at all. The movie Super 8 did this to a certain degree and I enjoy that movie but Stranger Things seemed to make it more real to me. What added to it especially was the music, from the opening credits to the score itself, the use of synth music worked excellently to bring you this mysterious, fascinating and yet nostalgic atmosphere; so all-in-all they really did well with the setting and time-period and will definitely be checking out the soundtrack, all of which served as a brilliant backdrop to the plot.As I said, a kid goes missing; it's something we've seen many times in television and film but because it is such an urgent, fearful, disturbing event you are instantly following the case because you want to know what has happened and you want to see him back; so from the very first episode I was hooked and I was staying. Now the series is only eight episodes and I think that's a good thing; a lot of American shows have upwards of twenty and sometimes that can lose momentum and become very episodic, which works depending on the nature of the series, but I do enjoy a lot of British shows where they usually have between six and thirteen episodes negating the need for fillers and can concentrate on a good script. Here the Duffer Brothers have crafted a simple but very well written story that feels more like a movie; each episode follows on instantly from the previous with no recaps or 'Next Time' trailers so if you were to watch Stranger Things, a binge is required. The also know when to show things and when to not, they spent their budget wisely and paid wonderful homage to the Hollywood of that time giving you visuals reminding you of things like The Goonies and E.T. These callbacks also never detract from the plot and fit the story well; also despite the 80s adventure inspiration, Stranger Things isn't necessarily for the Spielberg audience with one or two darker moments scattered here and there.Now I can't do this review without mentioning the cast. Winona Ryder and David Harbour are really well cast as the adult leads, from the desperate mother who still holds out faith to the driven police chief taking on mysterious government agents. The rest of the cast are largely unknown including the main kids but they were so talented. Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard being highlights having to display complex emotions and intelligent arcs. I wish I could mention all of the cast because they were so good, from Joe Keery as high school jock Steve to even the teacher Mr Clarke, each person had a life and character you were invested in.In the end Stranger Things is a really well made original series with some of the best cast, music and writing I've seen in awhile that also has some surprisingly good humour that made laugh out loud. I really hope the series gains traction because I can see the cast and crew going places, as well as a possible season 2."
706,"This is the second show I have ever felt compelled to rate however, it is the best series I have ever watched. The show is well written the characters have depth especially 11, and the show does one thing most shows fail to do now days they leave you wanting more.The casting is awesome every character adds to the show, and the main cast is top notch. Winona Rider delivers an award winning performance, but the best hands down is Millie Bobby Brown. I have never seen her before and it appears she is a newer actress but that kid delivers one of the strongest performances I have ever seen in a child actress. I also enjoyed Gaten Matarazzo as well. Although I did not mention the other kids honestly they were all great."
707,So....season three is here! Was so excited to watch it as seasons 1 and 2 were just fabulous and after binge watching season three I'm delighted to say I loved it!! I've read alot of the reviews of season three on here and I get it...it's different to seasons 1 and 2 but still a damn good watch. It had some sillines in it and some real lol moments and yes one or two cringy scenes but it's still great and I hope they carry on with it and make a season 4.Watch it and make your own judgement.
708,"I finished Stranger Things and although I thought it was alright, I can't say there's any chance I would've finished if everybody else wasn't raving about it. I have issues with it that I will now explain. SPOILERSI found the acting to be unimpressive. The children were great for TV child actors, but whenever their scenes came up I was unconvinced and disengaged. I also found most of the characters to be annoying to watch. They continually made assumptions that were silly with the information they had at the time. There are times where characters come to a far-fetched conclusion that is coincidentally correct, but if it weren't the truth these conclusions would make the characters seem dumb and crazy based on the information. Another thing about the characters is the sudden emotional shifts they would make towards one another that seemed so artificial and often out of character. It would be difficult to explain without going through an episode beat by beat, but it's all about the time, reason, and development.Throughout the series, with the exclusion of the sheriff, characters are constantly fumbling through the dangerous situations without any prior knowledge and preparation for them. Yet all of the main characters, except for Eleven who was obviously going to die from the very beginning, never die or take any serious injuries. When characters fumble around and just keep escaping with no effort or plan, slowly all the tension is lost for me. The reason I say with exception to Hopper, is because in his scenes he is the only character who seems at all capable and plans like his situations are actually dangerous.Let's talk about the homage aspect, because that's what it is, not a parody or satire. The clichés and awful, stupid parts of the series were often used knowing that they were clichés, but the series never did anything to show any SELF-AWARENESS. These clichés were placed with the knowledge that they are 80s tropes, but the series didn't show it understood what makes these tropes stupid! It just used them, never satirizing, exaggerating, or critiquing. When the villain of the series is overly evil and underdeveloped, when the dog somehow has the ability to sense the supernatural, it's not making fun of it. If someone can give me some reason as to how the series did show self-awareness, that would be appreciated.Let's address the monster in the room, that monster. It's rules are poorly defined, and the one characteristic they do give it doesn't make sense. It clearly only needs a small amount of blood going by how much Barbara bled before she was taken. So in the weeks in between when the monster first appears to get Will Byer and the end where El turns it into pixie dust, only six people in the entire area had any bleeding?! It's also interesting how Steve had blood on his face after his fight, but the monster never showed up then. I guess we never heard about that one HOSPITAL that got raided by the monster. And I guess all the women in the town never had any periods.The CG is bad. Don't tell me that it is an intentional, artistic decision, you know what the 80s were good for? Does it know what all those movies it kept referencing are known for, practical effects! I burst out laughing when the monster got burned by the CG fire.The ending isn't well-contained or wrapped up with so many loose ends left dangling for the sake of a happy ending from which to jump into a second season. However, the show does show self-awareness about this, when the kids are playing DND at the end they complain about how the campaign ended suddenly on a happy note with loose ends left unfinished. Take that for what you will.As someone who isn't that into 80s electronic music, I thought the soundtrack ranged from really good to OK depending on the song and how it was used. It was well shot and lit for a TV show, but I can't say I was ever impressed just having come out of Midnight Special that is similar in concept, tone, and aesthetic with far more impressive film making. If I wanted to go through the series episode by episode, I could keep going on and on. Just my thoughts on the series, with everyone raving about how fantastic it is I felt like I needed to defend my feelings on it. I'm glad everybody else loves it, but I would be lying if I said I would give it higher than a 6/10."
709,"This is a fantastic horror/comedy. I was so pleasantly surprised as I began watching this. It is funny, scary, dramatic, and heartwarming... Usually all in one scene. The story is really about relationships...The good and the bad ones. Every relationship in this series is complex to say the least. I've never seen something quite like it. The acting is super. The music always fitting. The production quality grade A. There is a gang of kids that reminded me of the Goonies...mischievous, fearless, hilarious, and totally adventurous. I won't say much about the plot, because I watched it blind and am so glad I did."
710,"Have been binging on a lot of series on Netflix and when the first peeks of this series came out it felt this would be something with a difference. And it truly was. Being an Indian I may not be able to identify with the 80s nostalgia of Americans but it truly provides a sneak peek into the trends and events that have been smartly woven into the story line. The costumes, the sets, the demeanor, everything seems reminiscent of those times. Now throw in a great 80s background score and over that potboiler of a sci-fi horror thriller. That entire recipe comes out as a unstoppable unputdownable story line that makes you hold your own right until the end. The smart screenplay holds the entire act right from beginning to end. There seem no slip ups and never in the entire season one feels let down by the superb efforts of everyone. All the actors have given a sterling performance with no voids left to fill. Overall a truly well made genius and hoping for more seasons in the follow through."
711,"The movie is really a mixture of clichés and ""borrowings"" from other series and movies, but somehow it's still enjoyable. I think, mostly due to the great cast and solid acting from the young actors. Visually, the shadows world is a blatant copy of the shadows world from Russian ""Night Watch"" movies. Some scenes have definite Spielberg movies inspiration. Throughout the series you will be like ""oh, I 've seen this already"" but you will, probably, continue to watch because who doesn't love well made old good sci-fi and, also, when the ""plump"" kid Dustin steals the show while on screen, your heart melts. All kids did great really. Winona's role was just too whiny and poorly developed for my liking. In ""youth"" category I really liked Joe Kerry. Though the main villain in the movie is the ""government agency"", I still think Dr Martin character was too sketchy and I did not quite catch what exactly those experiments were about."
712,"I've read the reviews - not all but enough. I've heard my friends talk about it. I was curious so even though I wasn't even remotely interested I decided to watch an episode. What I got was...""stranger things."" Wow. This show is so lame. I've heard people say it has the same atmosphere and feel from the 80's. It doesn't. They say it's like the new ""stand by me"" it's not. They say the kids are going on an adventure..maybe they are - but the adventure sucks. How do I know? I grew up in the 80's. I'm an 80's baby. This show sucks.The story line doesn't make me want watch another episode..it's like watching the X-Files when Chris Carter just gave up and started making those episodes with HUMOUR.Stranger things isn't scary, it isn't funny, it isn't interesting, it isn't anything new. The most interesting part of the show is the little girl and unfortunately the show is just so lame, I can't spend the time to figure out what happened to her because I just don't care. There are so many good shows and if you want to watch one with paranormal activity then watch Outcast on HBO. Now that's a show for an adult with drama instead of this PG13 trash.I'm not sure why people like this show..but it definitely doesn't get a 10..and Netflix did not ""do it again"" or ""get it right"" or ""bring real TV back"" or ""hit it out of the park"""
713,Sadly I couldn't give this zero star for how Terro le it is it's so terrible and it's so terrible that I dont want to watch it because it terrible. Ps its Terrible
714,"I really don't understand all the hate for season 3...I was hooked from the beginning to the end just like the previous two.
This series it's really well done, they put lots of heart in it and the good vibes from all actors involved are undeniable.
The 80s atmosphere is incredibly well recreated: the dresses, the hair styles, the cars, the buildings...everything. It was not an easy task but they did it.
The characters are hilarious and the CGI very convincing. What exactly do you want more?"
715,"Just got through Season 1, so admittedly late to the game. No idea what all the hype is about, nor why it is justified."
716,"Well, season one was great, but season 2 is full of liberalism for the SJW and their propaganda. Women act like men, more minorities than whites, mixed relationships, whites are evil, blah blah blah, same old, same old. Shouldn't the craziness in Hollywood be enough to prove to you people their way of looking at the world is warped!?"
717,"-Writing:1.9/2.5
-Acting:1.7/2
-Directing:1.6/2

718,"To quote Arnold Rimmer, ""I thought it was the worst pile of blubbery school-girl mush I've ever been compelled to endure. I consider it an insult to my backside I was forced to sit here growing carbuncles through such putrid adolescent slush.""How this steaming pile made it to 8.9 stars on IMDb seriously eludes me. The writing was cliché and riddled with plot holes, the pacing was agonizingly slow, and with the exceptions of Winona Ryder and Millie Bobby Brown, the acting was beyond cringe-worthy across the board. As we slogged through season 1, my wife and I said repeatedly to ourselves, ""This has *got* to start getting good at some point,"" but it never made it there. It didn't even come close to the hype we'd been fed. By the end, we threw up our hands in despair and bewilderment at its popularity.To be fair, the one redeeming quality was how the production design captured the '80s look and feel, which we have to admit was done exceptionally well. Beyond that, I fail to see why virtually everyone seems to have embraced this series as Netflix's preeminent title, especially in the face of such mastery that House of Cards brings to the table. I'm normally very forgiving about my entertainment, so I rarely say this, but I honestly feel cheated out of the time I spent watching this drivel. So, for those of you all excited about season 2, I can say only this: I sincerely hope you find it as enjoyable as season 1, and may God have mercy upon your benighted souls!"
719,This is the best tv show ive ever watched.i recommend you watch it its really worth your time.
720,"This show has a great combination of comedy and horror. I understand that most people don't like season 3, but I happened to enjoy it. If you haven't seen this show, don't let the reviews stop you from watching it. I can't wait for Stranger Things 4."
721,We are waiting the 4th season and it will by like orher 3 season. . Fantastic and perfect
722,"This was a TV show that started well. The first season had a decent story, a good setting and a good script. The second season was already weaker, a dish already eaten, but still visible. With the third season we hit the B-movie levels: a weird story and a very poor script. Even the general realization seems much less polished. How could Netflix give green light to the third season made in this way? A real mystery."
723,"Good, good characters, has a feel good quality about it, engaging and humorous. Enjoyable."
724,Season one and two are quite entertaining and the 80's feel is right on the money. Season 3 however has gone off the rails to the point of irritation. The dumbing down of Jim Hopper was a real disappointment. Winona still can't act and the story takes some really childish liberties. Real pity because they were on to something here.
725,"Russians are bad people again! Very disappointing. The season contains so many of American cliché stereotypes against Russians. Viewing Russians as torturers, killers, with no feelings, and evil. With all the creativity in the series they couldn't be, not only creative, but real about the enemy."
726,Its like if steven spielberg directed a stephen king book that turned into a telivison series. AKA perfect.
727,"Season 2 is probably the worst second season I've seen to a show - ever. Binge viewing can't even conceal the fact that this season was a total train wreck.Poor writing. Unnecessary charracters. Unoriginal (overused) 80's references.Just.. bad.
So, so bad."
728,"Why does everyone get so hyper about this? To me it's an alright show, but nothing special"
729,"This series is the only series I rate a one out of ten. This series has a great storyline to it and has great acting in it. This series has really impressed me, and I barley watch TV, but this show had me binge watching till the end. It shows the background of each character, and they went into deep background with one character that was in a government facility most of her life. The show brings true emotion to life, and the story is so engaging. Great job Netflix, great job to the actors and outstanding job to the Duffer brothers."
730,But pick up after worth 6.5 +.star rate 2 to lower the overate.Slow in developments .Disappointed in some aspects of the other dimension.Watchable .Can have been much darker and grittier.Get better later on that level.
731,"As always, it is difficult for any series or film to maintain the high quality standard of the first one. In this case, he has fulfilled it with honors. I have devoured the 9 episodes over the weekend with a desire for more. The eighties will always have an additional enjoyment and not a little will be flooded with that emotion when listening to the musical themes. I recommend the most fans and those who did not see her to do an authentic marathon and see season 1 and 2. They will not regret it."
732,"(Completely Spoiler Free) They did it, thank god. The best thing i can say about Stranger Things 2 is that it is a true continuation of the story laid out in season 1, rather than a repeat. And if you loved the characters from season 1, you are in for a treat.With all the hype surrounding Stranger Things, it seemed almost destined to disappoint in some way. For the MOST part, it doesn't. The show delves much deeper into its characters this time, rather than an overarching mystery. So while it lacks the breakneck binge worthy pace of season 1, it is surprisingly much more heartfelt and poignant than you might aspect. There is still a lot of action to love here but the characters are wisely front and center.The acting has seen a major step up from all of the kids, which isn't to say they weren't already great, but the material they have to work with is much richer this time round. It picks up one year after the events of the season 1, which left a huge impact on all the characters, and the writers didn't shy away that. There are some wrenching scenes here that drive home how much these kids have grown and changed over the year long time gap. Which brings us to the only problem. The cast size.There's no way to talk about it without major spoilers, so i'll just say this. There is one episode near the end of the season that feels like a major misstep. Its a filler episode which introduces a myriad of new characters that you don't care about,  and forces you to spend time with them.  It deviates so sharply from the central plot that it breaks momentum, and squanders any potential emotional impact it could have. Its a weak episode that is made even weaker because of its placement, and serves as the only sign that the writers are overreaching to fit in a grander narrative into what is otherwise a self contained story.Apart from that, the other new additions are great. If you were worried about Maxine, don't be. Go into Season 2 blind, but expect a slower pace. Stranger Things 2 is a different beast from Season 1, but once things gets going it reaches heights that emotionally bests its freshman year. Its funny, creepy, moving and exciting all at once, and delivers an immensely satisfying finale. Bring on Season 3."
733,I love I so much. You absolutely should watch it. The storyline is great. Amazing actors. Mus watch for everyone. It's so good like I honestly promise you won't reret watching it. I'm now trying to get the five line limit so yeah lol this is awkward. Don't mind me because I'm almost there. Great show and season two is coming out really soon so yeah just watch it.
734,"There are three problems which I can not ignore: The character by which everything happens is some one nothing can be given, this is because he has no presence as a character in himself because we always see him interacting with his family or friends through flashbacks, which reinforce the feelings of his family members and friends and how much importance that they has to him, but is never given a scene to know him better.The romance that arises has no basis; love is a feeling that in narrative media MUST be built and put reasons for which it is generated and flourishes. There is nothing that really justifies these feelings between one character and the other and it feels like an excuse to create a more emotional final scene.And speaking of the end of season: It is terrible. After all that happened through the series The bad ones are going to let them go just like that? The police did not ask questions? Journalists? How did everyone react in the village, seeing that everything happened to be a farce? Yes, there is a space to see the beginning of a new problem but everything feels very convenient (and I do not mention the jump time to justify why all the questions are not answered). The series has a lot of potential that, if it manages to squeeze enough, it can be remembered as one of the best Netflix products. Im waiting with attention the Second Season."
735,"The Goonies is just about my favourite movie and Stranger Things recaptures all that excitement of nostalgic adventures and kids believing that life is one big adventure. It's like Stephen King has thrown a dark spin on all the movies I watched growing up. I binge-watched Series One on Netflix and literally couldn't stop. It was exciting, scary, brilliant performances all around and superb design from all departments. I'm not really a fan of sci-fi but there was something about this which immediately grabbed me and made me compelled to keep watching, I think because it sits so well in the 80's. I'd highly recommend Stranger Things to anyone that appreciates stellar performances, particularly from the children, some mystery, intrigue and a nostalgic trip back in time. The soundtrack, production design totally transported me back in time. It makes me want to get a group of friends together, go off to the woods on our bikes and plot how to save the world. Brilliant, brilliant TV."
736,"Allow me to explain myself when it comes to my standards: I want something that amazes me. I want something with outstanding writing, appearance, acting, characters, and I judge my entries with those categories in mind.Writing Stranger Things, I believe, excelled in this area most of the time. The plot moved forward at a reasonable pace. Nothing felt too rushed or too dragged out. However, several things that occur felt too forced in without consulting common logic first. I'm mostly talking about Hawkins' decision to let the chief go free. Let's review: he broke into a government facility, saw some top-secret classified stuff, and his only punishment is a wiretap in (only) his house? This honestly feels like the writers were pushed into a corner with no logical way out. Another point to consider is the fact that nothing is either explained or implied; we, the audience, are just supposed to accept that happens with nothing built on top. What is this Upside-Down? Is it the work of supernatural forces? Aliens? Science gone wrong? What about the Hawkins' laboratory? Are there other kids part of the experiments? How did 11 manage to escape in the first place? How did the chief get to the bottom floor of a top-secret government facility without so much as a gun shot at him? Aside from this nit-picking, the writing is solid throughout, but lacks logic when need be. Score: 7/10Appearances: This is where Stranger Things truly shines. The directing does a beautiful job of bringing out those intense scenes. The visuals are nothing short of stunning. If I had to give a complaint, it would be ""Does the Upside-Down have to be completely gray?"". The music only further emphasizes the emotion and impact of every scene. It's actually a memorable score, the title card theme being the shining example of that. Score: 10/10Acting: A shining, but less impactful element in Stranger Things. The emotions that the characters bring are truly something to gawk at. The main problem with having a primary cast of children is usually the acting, and this is no exception. A lot of the acting done by the kids feels over-dramatized to the point of being hilarious. Winona Ryder I think carried the series with her amazing portrayal of a mother on the verge of insanity. Every time she was on screen I was prepared to see some crazy stuff happen. Score: 8/10Characters: Something Stranger Things fails at is having believable characters. While the plot chugs away doing its thing, it leaves no room for character familiarity or development. The main character, Mike, is a typical middle schooler that plays D&D with his friends: Dustin, the typical gluttonous kid, Lucas, whose only character trait is being jealous of Mike and having a dad that fought in Vietnam, and Will, who gets around 15 minutes of total screen time. Got to include not one, but two sets of two-dimensional bullies! I wish Steve got more screen time, as the series ended just as he was becoming interesting. Nancy has no personality at all. She can shoot a gun, and that's the only character trait she has. Jonathan also suffers from having pretty much no personality. He's shown as being a loner in school and a member of the photography club, but that's all there is to his character. The rest of the characters have even less personality; they're just stuck in as filler characters so the scenes would be less lonely. At least Hopper and Joyce were interesting, albeit also a bit lacking. Score: 2/10Stranger Things has a few things going for it, but not enough to be too excited over. The writing was solidly done, but lacking in logic at times. The appearances are nothing short of breathtaking, each moment being encapsulated with a score and visuals to remember. The acting was all-around solidly done. The kids, however, ruin the immersion of having believable people be part of the story. The characters fell completely flat, as every single one has a few bullet points attached to their name. None of them come off as believable people, just as plot points in a story.Final Score: 7/10More Personal Thoughts: Here's how you check to see if your characters come off as people. If you remember their name hours after you finished watching, then you've at least partially succeeded. I had to keep referencing the cast list because I forgot almost all of the characters' names."
737,"OK, usually I don't bother with reviews from the first seasons. I am that ""holding back"" guy who doesn't like to rush into believe in something. But THIS, guys, was EXTRAURDINARY! The period, perfect! The casting, good. The kids were diamonds! No more than 15 y.o. and already better than most B rating actors. But the most amazing, was the story. Aaaa smells fresh, just out of the oven! Sure the concept is known, sure some characters we have seen them before. But it's not about that. The way they put them together along with the new elements... This writer should be proud of this work! And I am lucky I got to see it. Be prepared to stay on the edge of your couch, sink into thinking, get sad and happy. Be ready to enjoy a truly good series."
738,"This show really deserves 12 stars, not 10, for brilliance in every category. Spielberg fans will recognize lots of references to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""E.T.,"" and J.J. Abrams' ""Super 8"" (itself a huge Spielberg reference), but this is a good thing. Humankind's fear of the dark probably dates back to before shadows flickered at the edges of nighttime campfires in the mouths of caves, and ""Stranger Things"" exploits that fear masterfully. The story combines fear, horror, loss, different kinds of love, and the right amount of heart into a perfectly balanced mixture. Then when you are sure you know what will happen in the next shot, a twist surprises you.Television does not get better than this: there is not an ounce of fat anywhere in the storytelling; the editing is superb, especially the scene transitions; and the entire cast are fabulous. Winona Ryder, always a strong actress, does an outstanding job of portraying the emotional journey her character experiences, but everyone else is perfect in their roles as well -- the casting department deserves major kudos here.If you don't have a Netflix subscription, get one now. And settle in for a binge...and don't blink."
739,"It's silent hill, slender man and ET all combined. I love horror flicks and this series is amazing! This is a drama suspense horror series and one of my top favorites. Whoever Rates this below an 8 doesn't know what they're talking about or didn't really watch it and give it the respect it deserves. When I started the series I could not stop, I watched the full series in on day. What can I say the acting and the whole cast was brilliant. I enjoyed it, I hope there's another season. I also hope the second season is good as the first one or even better. I just don't see how anything can be as good as the first one, but it would be awesome if they could keep it up. The casting, director and the producer were amazing.. great job Netflix!"
740,"Seriously loved this series.First off let's be honest, I'm an 80's man, so this gelled with me with ease.Even the guys who do the soundtrack are fantastic. The author, the musicians the director, the actors. This combination combines to form something which has been lacking for a long time. Something that get's me and that's appealing to both children and adults.This connected with me in so many ways and is off to an absolutely amazing start. I can't wait to see what happens next.The first season is in the vein of Steven Speilbergs Super 8, which was also one of the best movies he's ever done in my firm opinion.This series is like ET for a new generation with the added bonus it's set in an age that eliminates computers and mobile phones everywhere. An age were people connected and actually made friends, not just associates who keep them from there screens.Seriously fun, amazingly chilling and superbly atmospheric. I can't recommend it enough if you grew up with ET and loved 'Super 8'. If so, then your in for a treat. If not, then perhaps you'll find some new magic in story telling."
741,"The show is pretty average and you will like it just for nostalgia sake IMHO. The direction and plot lines borrow a lot from 80's movies like the thing,E.T and so on and there is nothing original there. the first 4 episodes are very slow and drag on a lot. The acting is the most mediocre I have seen. The kids are okay not that great and they forming the most part of the show it becomes difficult to watch. The music is fantastic and that is one positive point. I could not binge watch it and had to watch it in a week. it just does not grip you.if it would have been an original take on the scifi genre it would have helped."
742,"I don't usually get too excited about new T.V. shows I've recently discovered, apart from maybe 'Vikings,' but on this occasion it must be mentioned. If you haven't already I implore you to watch this show. The Acting is superb, the casting spot on, the soundtrack inspired, the pacing and mood totally mesmerizing. I have tried very hard to find faults or weak links in each episode and I honestly can't. It's all those great movies and T.V. shows we grew up watching as kids all rolled in to one, and yet in so many ways better than any of them. They all played a part in our childhood, they still give us that wonderful feeling of nostalgia and that is exactly what 'Stranger Things' does. It reminds us of how film used to make us feel when we where kids, and how could that possibly be a bad thing?Millie Bobby Brown deserves an Oscar, she has more talent in her little finger than half the cast of 'Game of Thrones.' Every one word / line delivery leaves you entirely invested in her performance, every emotion is displayed so intensely and openly in her eyes that she puts most adult actors to shame. This show deserves your attention, it may have taken a lot from the old 80's classics but isn't that what great art is? Paying homage to what came before but also respectfully making it better?"
743,"Sure, the 80s look and feel is great, including the title sequence and the music, but that's not all. Every main character evolves and becomes better versions of themselves. The use of Dungeons & Dragons as a metaphor to help us and the main characters to understand what is happening. This show was very well thought out and executed.I don't like giving 10/10 because (usually) nothing is perfect, there's always things that could have been done better, but the creators of Stranger Things nailed everything. Well done!Let's hope season 2 is just as good! :)"
744,"I have watched hundreds and thousands of movies and TV series and rated them all but its my second review for anything on IMDb. I had feeling that i have to write about it. After Mr. Robot, this TV show ""Stranger Things"" just passed out all the standards of being perfect. Its so addicted that you cant leave without watching whole show in one sit. While watching I was remembering the old classics ""Stand by Me"" & ""The Breakfast Club"" and enjoying the better added fantasy and perfection to it. Seriously i don't know who are the creators of Netflix but those people are really great and should make some historical hits like this. I will save this in my archive of best shows ever."
745,"I went in to watch this series without any understanding of what it's about, and the style of it. Even though I had heard a lot of boasting about this, I figured I'd just try it. When it first started I got chills. It felt kind of nostalgic but new. The style reminds me of Twin Peaks. I was hooked before episode 1 was done, and I ended up binge-watching the whole season. The characters are fantastic, and the acting is really impressive. The story was perfect and left me in a state in which I can't wait until the next season. The Duffer brothers have made this my all time favorite series."
746,"...And now it happened.(I need 10 lines of text to be able to post this review but I have nothing to add.)It's magical, adventurous, never boring. The kids' acting (all of them) is out of this world. Just like the story, the atmosphere, everything.Stranger Things feels like one movie, and still it's too short. An endless story would be exactly right. Every episode my man and I were glued to the screen, almost sucked in. I love how nothing they came up with is too much. Could have been the case, like with so many fantasy/ sci-fi movies (if you ask me). It has just the right vibe.More of this please. Thank you."
747,"OK, so I never understood why people on IMDb or wherever else would need any detailed description of a movie before watching it. For me it was always - worthy or not worthy trying. So all I'm gonna say is: it's worthy. Worthy as hell. Just do yourself a favor and watch it. You won't regret it. But, as IMDb requires 10 lines of text for a review, I'll add it has unique value for people born before the era of smartphones and goddamned Pokemons. It's very nice to watch people living in a still analog world, in a moment when computers are just going to enter our lives. Not that I have anything against computers, I was born in 1979 and enjoyed Atari, Amiga and PC very much, but this show just takes you to your very childhood if you were born somewhere between 1970 and 1980.Once again - watch it."
748,"Netflix really bought an excellent product, it took me directly thirty years ago. Good soundtrack, nice photography. Dungeons and dragons was the first nostalgic memory. The show is full of good 80's references. I never heard the Duffer Brothers name, but this time they really did it. I liked your work pretty much. Winona Ryder and David Harbour were good... but the kids were awesome, Finn, Millie, Gaten and Caleb... Kudos! Goonies, Super 8, ET, all together. An nice adventure, with mystery, love and friendship that you must watch. I enjoyed it a lot. Can't wait for season 2."
749,"""Stranger Things"" is quite an anomaly in today's overly saturated market of media crap and thin drama - and a good one. The 80s are for children what the early 60s were for young men, the ""decade du jour"" of all things good and valuable: friendship, character building, fantasy, adventure, learning the facts and pains of life without overprotective parents and eyes constantly gazing at iPhones. It was also the high point of the second golden age of cinema, when George Lucas and Spielberg were kings and the highly emotional rollercoasters fun films were the norm - and special effects were meant to dazzle and tell a fantastic story, and not distract us.It's a particular sentiment of comprehensible nostalgia that has been attempted to be ""captured"" and ""reproduced"" before by J.J. Abrahams: ""Super 8"" comes to mind again and again when seeing ""Stranger Things"". It's like watching a craftsman building a vintage car from scratch: it's the same thing, and at the same time, it is most certainly not. All of the elements are there, complete with slowly fading credits with film scratch marks, but it's impossible to avoid seeing the modern touches of editing, lightning, CGI, and the eventual winks to the audience that this is a period piece (which is particularly painful for those, including myself, who have lived in that era).""Stranger Things"" borrows from it all: apart from the obvious ""Super 8"", there's bits and pieces of ""ET"", ""The Thing"", ""The Goonies"", ""Fire Starter"", ""Akira"", and even some nuances of ""Neon Genesis Evangelion's"" Rei Ayanami on Eleven's speech and behavior. Sometimes it fails, being a ""paint by the numbers"" replication of those formulas, leaving plot holes and thin characterizations behind like a trail of bread crumbs leading you to what media produces today for the millennial audience unaccustomed with plot and emotion. On some times, it succeeds going beyond that level and portraying an engaging story that invites you to look beyond the clichés and enjoy this series for what it is.All in all, ""Stranger Things"" can be truly recommended, is a guilt pleasure of the most extraordinary kind, and rarely you will find a moment where, albeit flaws, you are not enjoying it."
750,"There is no reason, in terms of story, for Stranger Things to take place in the '80s. But the '80s atmosphere - the dial phones, the chain smoking, Winona Ryder - are there to clue you in on the inspiration for this movie, which is pretty much every supernatural movie from the 80s with a focus on kids. E.T., Poltergeist, that sort of thing.The wondrous thing is how dead-on this tribute. It's not just the clothes and hair, but the style of acting, the scripting approach, the structure, all hold true to their inspiration. You've got the young nerdy kids, the horny, unsure teenagers, the monster, the mysterious one with the power, the bad science/government people, the conflicted investigator, the tearful mom.You could argue that this entire season is simply a pastiche made up of recycled elements, and I wouldn't disagree, but it really feels less like a copy and more like something of that era, as though the writers had fallen into a coma in 1985, woke up and got to working.While it doesn't have the high style of the Spielberg films that are a primary influence, it does have the likability. The story is consistently engaging and fun, the acting is excellent, and the movie has sufficient laughs and tears to satisfy."
751,"When a young boy, Will, disappears things start to go wrong. A girl with superpowers appears and a whole crew of bad guys are trying to hunt her down. Who is she? Why are they hunting for her? But that's not all. A monster is there too. It is hunting... That's a bit of a synopsis of the story told in a very vague and short way, but I want to keep it interesting, so hey? The directing of ""Stranger Things"" was mostly done by the Duffer Brothers, as they are credited, AKA Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer. These two directed six episodes. They were really great. At first I didn't think that they could pull it of, directing with the two of them, but after seeing the pilot, I knew that they could. They made every shot look like a piece of art. But of course, this isn't only thanks to them, also thanks to the brilliant cinematographers. They were great at their job. There was only one shot that I think could've looked better and that was the one in the last episode where Hopper looks up with a bit of teary eyes. This shot just looked a bit of to me. I've praisen the Duffer Brothers, but they weren't my favorite directors of the show. This was Shawn Levy. He only directed two episodes, but he did them well. It was barely noticeable that there was a different director, but some of Levys camera movements were just fantastic. With this I don't mean that the Duffer Brothers didn't have some good camera movements. In the last three episodes they were also fantastic. The editing was handled masterfully, but with some flaws. Sometimes I could see a split-second of another shot, where-after the shot really changed. This I could see around two times in total. This doesn't take away the fact that the editing was great. There were some clever cuts in the second last and the last episode, switching between the perspective of Hopper and Wills mom and the kids. This was also very good, this kept you on the edge of your seat and both sides had different pacings which was very interesting. They were both tense full, but on another way. With the kids it was faster paced than with Hopper and Joyce.In contrast to the cgi. This was fine, but noticeable. Well, it was way better than some of the cgi I see in movies nowadays. I think that they could've made it more scary if they used props instead. I can understand why they didn't do that, though. For practical reasons. But let's not forget that this is still a TV-show - even though it looks like a movie most of the time and that's a compliment - and that it's common that TV-shows don't have great cgi. They did also use some great sets, the sets of the Upside Down world were good looking and had a 'scary' feel to them. The soundtrack was superb. I very much liked the songs, as you can see in the title of my review. I used a part that is song a lot in the movie. The songs fitted the theme quiet well. After this I usually discuss the actors, so let's stay in the trend, shall we? The series has a big cast, so I will select some people out of it. First of we have Winowa Ryder as Joyce or Wills mom. She was very good. She had some bad moments, but these flew away quickly. She showed of her emotional side throughout most of the show and at the end a more relaxed side. It was very cool to watch her switch between both. Mike was the leader of the group if I had to pick one. He was played by Finn Wolfhard. As a kid actor he was fantastic, so were the other kid actors (Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin) I want to mention Millie in particular because she was the stand-out to me. She was really good. She played the character of Eleven. I also find it impressive that she shaved of her hair, that's very brave for such a young girl. Natalia Dyer played Nancy. She too was great. Charlie Heaton wasn't as good as everyone else, but was still good.The script is also very good. Not just the dialogue but the story and characters as well. Each character has depth or makes an arc, and you care about each single one of them, which makes the series only more tense. Weird hu, Hollywood, that when you care about characters the action scenes are more tense and better? Maybe you should try that for once. The character of Steve surprised me the most. He seemed like a douche, but thanks to fantastic writing I started to like him more and he also changed and became nicer. But the thing that I really want to mention is how quickly the show makes you care about someone. Only in the second episode (the second!) I already was near to crying when Jonathan hung up posters of his brother that he had made. His acting was fantastic at that moment and you could see the grief in his eyes, which is also something good. The ways they show how the people handle the loss of Will. How his mother becomes near insane and Jonathan suppresses. But all characters were great, I just named a few. They were interesting and fun to watch and evolve. The story was also interesting and kept you on the edge of your seat. It was complicated but that was its charm.In the end ""Stranger Things"" was fantastic. I am looking forward to next season. There was superb directing, acting and writing, with some of the best developed characters I've seen in a while.10/10"
752,Basically this shows is pretty good besides the fact they copy every 80s TV cliché and movie from that time out there.from Alf ..Back to the future two ...lord of the rings to the hobbit cartoons and big props to poltergeist plus a little Freddy Krueger in it LOLnot kidding very addictive show I watched it in two days eight hours of my time that because Netflix is doing a pretty good job these days surprisingly..with the fallout of Neflix stocks recently and the rate increases LOL JK JK
753,"On the surface, the new Netflix original series ""Stranger Things"" is a science fiction/paranormal thriller set in a small 1980's suburban town where a group of kids and others confront mysterious and terrifying forces. However more importantly, this series is a marriage of elements from classic Spielberg and Stephen King, and acts as a love letter to 80's cinema. Direct or subtle references are made to ""The Thing"", ""Halloween"", ""It"", ""The Goonies"", ""Stand By Me"", ""E.T."", ""Carrie"", ""Jaws"", ""The Shining"", ""Poltergeist"", ""Evil Dead"", and possibly even more films that I did not recognize. Combining these clever homages to classic cinema with incredible pacing, cinematography, soundtrack, and performances makes this series one of my absolute favorites. I highly recommend giving this series a look even if you don't understand the many homages and references just because of how well this show is directed. I would even describe the small town setting, mysterious antagonistic forces, dramatic pacing, and desperate investigation for truth as a more easily digestible form of True Detective season 1, another absolute favorite of mine. Another comparison likely to be made is to J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"", however the narrative similarities are simply due to both of these works accomplishing the same thing, giving an appreciative and nostalgic nod to Spielberg's classic work. If I had to choose some weaker elements of ""Stranger Things"", I suppose they would be predictability in the plot and lack of complexity in the dialogue. TLDR: I loved it, definitely give it a shot"
754,"OK I do not give 10 because that would require me having multiple  orgasms as I am watching and that ain't about to happen. This is a good  little series and well developed and a fine piece of scripting. The  direction is not seen and that is exactly what it should be. My main  congrats goes to the actors. Most of them did a great job and were well  casted. I was very impressed with Winona Ryder's performance which was  a balancing act between many unforgiving aspects of character and she  pulled it off very nicely. I think her weakness versus strength moments  were actually brilliant acting and deserves later recognition. The kids  were outstanding and very much so well delivered and likable. I think  we have a few new starts and I mean real acting stars on that horizon.  As to the plot which also was well developed I have my only concern. It  seems that the big bad government aspect is still a part of American  society that requires more diligent perusal. I do not agree with these  sentiments that the government is the bad guy and we are all at the low  end of the social spectrum This 99% mentality really sux and it is high  time that the citizens of the US wise up and stop blaming the  government for everything and have a look in the mirror first. Because  the craft that was displayed in this series was of such a high standard  I do not wish to labor the point but people, you really need to grow up  a bit about this anti government mentality. It is childish and just  plain ignorant."
755,"This was the nostalgia itch that I didn't know that I needed scratched. After so many reboots and remakes from my childhood that ultimately fail to deliver more than a hint of what made the originals great, I determined that I must be getting too old and cynical to appreciate things in the same way as I used. It's only a matter of time until I become the ""they don't make them like they used to"" guy. Stranger Things laughs at the notion that the wonder and adventure from that time period can't be recreated, and makes it obvious what the other attempts at capturing this have missed. It doesn't show you that you are in that you are back in your childhood by putting a kid in an Indiana Jones costume and dressing teenagers in loud clothes with big hair. It makes you feel it with a hundred little details that you forgot about and I can't thank the creators enough. Somebody still makes them like they used to, and apparently, I'm still capable of being able to have the same wonder, joy and investment that I did all those years ago."
756,"The moment I saw the intro to this show I was transported back to the 80's! I got this euphoria feeling of being a kid again watching those big 80's movies when I still could awed by films... that's when I knew this show was something else.I think this is the best show by Netflix (yes, including House of Cards and Marco Polo, both of which I love) The nostalgia feeling mixed with great acting, story, script, directing make for an awesome series. It felt like a Stephen King story (IT came to mind), hope they make a season 2!Adult actors are all great but it's the kids that run this show... All main kid characters are well rounded and these young actors did a fantastic job.Two thumbs way up."
757,"Netflix's newest monster mystery mini-series, Stranger Things, is a lovingly made homage to the kinds of 80's horror and adventure films that I loved as a kid. Combining John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg and Stephen King, the Duffer Brothers somehow create an entirely fresh feeling and unexpectedly engrossing sci-fi series. The highlight for me is the group of D+D loving misfit school friends (particularly the toothless Dustin) who are forced to get their act together, Goonies style, to deal with the disappearance of their friend Will Byers. There's plenty of comedy in these endearingly nerdy boys that contrasts brilliantly with the darker, supernatural elements of the show. Winona Ryder, too, stood out for me as the frazzled parent of the missing child, providing some very memorable moments. Can't recommend this highly enough."
758,"At first I saw a lot of Spielburg in Stranger Things, then once I got a few episodes in I realized that it's actually inspired mostly by Stephen King stories. Stranger Things = Stephen King (get it?). The biggest contributors I've noticed are Stand By Me, Dead Zone, Creepshow and Firestarter. It's very well done, the visuals are great, the acting is good and the pace is brisk enough that it should keep most people interested. It does help if you're familiar with 80's thrillers because nostalgia is one of Stranger Thing's strengths.It's definitely weird, which is expected. I definitely see this show becoming a quick cult favorite."
759,"Loved seasons 1 and 2.
But everything about season 3 is sloppy. The writing, the drama, the tropes. The acing was good but nothing about season 3 was family friendly."
760,Just Watched first episode of S03 and it's fire I can't wait to watch the rest of the show
761,Pure perfection! The best tv show mankind ever witnessed.
762,"All of the good series on TV seem to die in the same fashion.
Start off with a good first season, then beat the plot to death, last stage is to go all Social Justice to push an agenda and the show falls apart ( Man in the High Castle)
Stick to entertainment- not propagandaSeason 1 ? Great except for obviously being sponsored by the tobacco instituteSeason 2 ? Ummm, Okay. Elle goes punk, same generic bad guys, Black kid gets the white girlSeason 3 ???? Long speech on lesbianism, how popular guys are trash, how women are empowered and don't need men, especially sexist white male bosses. Ridiculous Russians in a secret gigantic underground fortress, running around carnivals with guns while no one seems to notice.Social Justice checklist- Go !Lesbians GOOD- check
All Bad Guys are White Males ONLY- check
Women better, smarter, stronger than men- check
No evil Gay, minority or women- check
Mixed race couple ( Black male/White Female)- check
Smartest kid is Black female genius- check
Communists are really good at heart- check
ProAmerican Mayor is evil- check
Total lack of Asian and Hispanic characters- checkNot to mention the ridiculous product placement- at this point, the producers are just phoning it in hoping to cash out big time before the series implodes"
763,"Oh. My. God.
I've never liked a show so much and hated it at the same time - I guess Game of Thrones - but ...
I loved this show.
And then season 3 happened.
Who wants to watch kids kissing all the time. Gross. So. Freaking gross.
It was almost unbearable.
Didn't even finish the season because it was so lame. They completely lost touch with their audience - which by the way dumb writers - wasn't a bunch of 12 yr olds. It was a bunch of Generation Xers remembering their long lost childhoods.. before cell phones and tablets.
And we don't want to watch a bunch of kids kissing all the time ... and really don't care that they got boyfriends and girlfriends ( which totally ruined it and wasn't realistic at all, which was most of the allure of this show in the first place... yes flying black blobs of evil aren't exactly realistic - but it was the feeling of childhood ... how we remember feeling and how we remember being with our friends. No one started getting into relationships back then in fifth grade. No one. Except city kids and this wasn't about them. )
Lame on you Netflix for ruining a great show. With sex no less!"
764,"Too slow
too slow
too slow..
too slow
winona rider too slow"
765,"I'm not impressed. I'm watching season 1 and it seems pretty formulaic and illogical on so many levels. Some of the actors are just caricatures, like Steve's two friends; they're laughable. Mathew Modine as Dr. Brenner is another uninspired caricature; he's annoying. It's a good ""filler"" show when there's nothing else on."
766,"We finished Season 3 the other day and while thinking about it the past few days, I keep coming back to...meh. It was entertaining, mostly, but I think we've had enough. The first season was new and fresh and fun, the second less so, and now these kids are getting older and aren't quite as charming, and any chemistry they all had as pals was missing in S03 as they spent it mostly apart. Of course, the pitch perfect 80s pop cultural references and songs were fun, but you can't hang an entire series on just that. I enjoyed Max and Erica the most in this season, Hopper was aggressive and ugly, and while the ending is ambiguous, I hope they call it a day and leave us with a pleasant lingering memory of ""Neverending Story""."
767,Many hated this season 3 but i loved it. A pure entertainment... And the final episode is the visual treat. I accept there are few loopholes in the story like why Russians trying to open the gate but that can be explored in next season. I loved Robin and especially Erica... That little girl is talent package. But yea... I didn't like Mike's character development... Felt cringy sometimes... But overall this season is superb. Production design up to the mark.
768,"Ultimate.
Binge watched Stranger Things Season 3, and I have completed it.
I have seen both the seasons before and have loved them equally for which I became a fan of this series.
It's based in a town called Hawkins where the story kicks off by a kid going missing, but what's the reason and what follows is the treat you shouldn't miss.
It was worth the wait and Season 3 by far was one of the best seasons of this franchise.
Acting by Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, David Harbour and Winona Ryder were the best undoubtedly.
Not to forget Joe Keery, Dacre Montgomery and Priah Nicole Ferguson in this season.
This season has balanced it all, be it the music or the rush you've been looking for.
Of all things, it will make you feel things which you haven't felt in a long time.
Don't miss this if you haven't already.
Get some munchies, log in to your Netflix and I guess you won't be chilling a lot because there are Stranger Things in Hawkins that might not let you."
769,"Stranger Things is highly overrated because it's boring,childish,empty and with a story already seen many times and full of clichés.The acting and directing is OK but predictable, being the Sheriff and Winona Ryder the best in my opinion, the visuals are good recreating the 80's and the special effects in the same level.About the 80's..it's not the 80's if the characters spend too much time making references to it.. (Lando....Lando...Lando...shut up..cliché fat-hat-kid with funny speaking.So,after the movie Super 8 making fun of the 80's (i kind of like the movie even if the name JJ_destroyer_of_Star_Wars_Abrams was there.)we have a 80's based show. The 80's are the new 2010's. Well,i love the 80's i was a kid full of dreams about the excellent movies and shows they created but when recreate them today, don't forget to make them unforgettable and full of magic but at the same time simple and full of heart as they were. And...PLEASE, somebody give Eggos to Nancy...."
770,"If you're familiar with Stephan Spielberg's films, and find yourself enjoying them more times than not, then you really owe it to yourself to watch this series. Story: 9 The main plot revolves around finding a lost boy, Will, and a government experiment gone horribly wrong. This plot is extremely thrilling and sucks me into the screen every time the show is focused on it, however, the rather generic high school subplot that laces most of Nancy's story line lacks some creative ""umph"" if you will. But that's where the characters come in. Characters: 9 Stranger Things does an exemplary job of building a believable, well directed, well scripted main cast, yet, the side characters suffer from blandness. The three boys are phenomenally well written, it was a nostalgic rush of hanging out with my friends as a kid. Sound: 9 The techno beats underlying the tense scenes are gorgeous and give this series a unique musical identity. Visuals: 8 The sets were amazing, they appeared and felt exactly like an 80's town. The monster, however, is clearly not where most of the budget went. Overall: 9 You'll laugh, cry, and scream as you watch this cast suffer through and eventually triumph over a daunting mystery."
771,"Much have been written about this series love for the early 80s. And it's understandable. The whole period of John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, teenage horror-movies and cold war paranoia has been mixed together to a real tasty love potion. If you're too young and don't love the 80s for sentimental reasons you probably will after a few episodes of Stranger Things.The story is set in a small rural town and revolves around a missing boy. His friends is soon dragged into a mystery and an adventure. Goonies and I.T. with the BMX bikes, nerds turning into heroes and a friendship story worthy a Spielberg movie. But there is so much more. The older sister have her own problems and her adventure makes an equally intriguing and fun story including all the ingredients for a classic high school horror movie. Under age drinking, skinny dipping and stupid boyfriends. And finally there is the confused and distraught mother and the towns sheriff also trying to solve the mystery.What impresses me the most is how the series manages to keep all three parts of the plot relevant and interesting all the way to the climax. The pacing is mostly perfect and so is the acting. The child characters are all well played, specially Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven and the funny character Dustin played by Gaten Matarazzo. Of course Winona Ryder is brilliant as the desperate mother.The 80s atmosphere is well set with great horror sequences with the mandatory light flickering, scare jumps and electronic music that could have been made by John Carpenter. There is a lot of John Carpenter stuff going on here and it's great. Some of the inspirations for the series are even featured in one way or the other. Stephen King, The Thing, Michael Myers, and a few more. The only weaknesses I can find here is the somewhat uninteresting bad guys. And David Harbours sheriff doesn't do it for me. His character don't add up so to speak. There is something missing there. But these minor flaws are very minor.Stranger Things is defiantly some of the best TV I've seen for the last three years or so."
772,"This show has great actors, a very well-written plot that keeps you in suspense every epidsode. I binged watched all 8 shows in two days. Reasons to watch this show - characters' emotions and reactions are much more true to real life than how most shows are written, 80's nostalgia that isn't all ruffle skirts, sprayed feathered hair, and blue eyeshadow; the episodes are written as chapters of a story and not separate episodes. I also like how not all of the information is given to you right away, hence great writing of a serial show. Episodic shows are stories each in their own tied together with an inner story. This show is like watching a book your reading. I like that and so did my kids. They couldn't get enough of it. I like that each character has their own flaws and there's no perfect hero. I can't think of anything to improve upon. The special effects were great and believable. There wasn't too much of it either. Maybe the only unbelievable part is the character of the the science teacher. He's a little too naive. And the bullies are a little too extreme. Most kids would back down and never say a word if they saw what Eleven could do. Bullies usually back down once challenged. After the kid peed himself, I can't imagine he would go back for more. There's very few people that would keep up that kind of hatred. Love the show. Want more."
773,"Netflix, you've done it again. Another quality production. The cast were excellent, the story-line fresh and new and the script was riveting and exciting. UNFORTUNATELY, ... I got overly excited and watch all 8 episodes in one day. I should have stretched it out but, hey, ... I loved it. I do have a question, however. There seemed to be an opening for another season at the end. Am I right? I realize that may not have been the intention but I know that I would certainly love to see another one. Of course, bringing back El would have to be a foregone conclusion. I would also have to agree with a previous reviewer that mentioned that the government entourage was pretty weak in this series. I would suggest beefing them up and making them more believable in any future effort."
774,OK I just finished seeing the series all in one breath; eight thrilling episodes. You are nostalgic of the 1980s? You like the goonies? X-files? Visitors? Have you played Atari? Do you know what Dungeons and dragons? If the answer is always yes then with this series take center you will have an adrenaline rush that will take you back in time of 36 years. And if the atmosphere in which it's set did not satisfied with everything so well conceived a storyline will take care that you'll be hooked on the chairs until the very last minute. The theme song of the series is brilliant!!! If you have doubt in trying Netflix this series will make you change your mind.
775,"Quality Science Fiction and Horror stories are a rarity, but I've seen Stranger Things. The brilliant 80's style ""Tron"" music and electrifying title set the mood for this epic adventure. Reminiscent of iconic 80's films like The Goonies and ET, but with the sophistication only a modern series could deliver.High Production Value Visually Interesting Above average performances on the wholeGreat for binge watching under the covers on a cold and rainy night. Truly one for a night of Netflix and ""chillin""."
776,"An extremely well written story of a group of young friends whose selfless altruism out thinks adults and lets their brilliance save the day. We spent our entire Saturday binge watching from beginning to end. The acting was masterful and the plot was unique. The only reason I didn't give it 10 stars was the regular, unwelcome diversions from the core story...why do writers think we like the tired device of the local adolescent sociopaths who harass the heroes? I could not grasp why the bullying scenes were necessary, because the core story had more than enough power to carry the series all the way through. Each relevant character evoked either our sympathy for their triumphs, or satisfaction when they earned justice. We cared about what happened to them - good writing."
777,"Stranger Things is another very good offering from Netflix.. it certainly holds its own with the best in the horror genre on TV.. a stronger area than some would have us believe.. Walking Dead, American Horror, Penny Dreadful, Outcast.. strong performers all. As someone who grew up in the 80s the cultural references in this are off the charts.. you can see what they watched and read for inspiration, It, the Langoliers, ET... even Predator.. apart from some fairly obvious reasons heres a great one for fans of the Arnie classic... Jim Hopper saves Hawkins from the monster... My one minor complaint is that at a couple of points the cgi/green screen is a bit dodgy. The make up, sets, acting, direction and writing make up for it though and most of the visual FX are decent.. It is left for a season 2 if there will be one, but not to worry it's not left on a cliffhanger which is always a relief. All in all another great one for a binge session."
778,"Breathtaking. Watched it in one sitting. It really feels like it would be originating in the 80's. Great Costume, Set Design, Soundtrack, Artwork, directing, photography and so on. When i watch movies out of the period the Show is set in, I always think how sad it is, that movies or TV shows aren't made like that anymore. So it was a real pleasure to see with how much love for detail the team reconstructed, not just the look but the whole feeling of an 80's movie. The child actors are great and, if they won't end up with a drug addiction, will have a great career. The last episode was basically an hour of crying. Netflix one again, shows how high the quality of their own productions is and how important they have become as one of the big players. Its definitely one of my favorite newcomers this year and I'm looking forward to the next season."
779,I saw the first season somewhat reluctantly but avoided the second. Now I tried the third but it's just awful nonsense with the most unattractive kids on the planet. I can't even tell the girls from the boys. The show just sucks. Total trash.
780,"There's massive expectations for each new season and diehard fans who will love it all. But I do think it's always going to be about Season one.
Season one was so well produced, perfectly cast, perfect amount of suspense, emotion and humour. The kids are all brilliant, and can't imagine any other actors playing them. The dialogue and humour was always en pointe, and you rooted so much for them.
Season two you knew more of what could expect and it largely delivered, with less of a childlike view on the situation as they age and go through the events. The plot was obviously in line with a preplanned storyarc for the first 2 seasons so worked smoothly.
Season three, just tried too hard and missed the mark a little. Too many side stories and a lack of comradeship between the original four lessened it's charm.
With each season the expectations have increased but the storylines are getting poorer and the jokes a bit stale as it takes itself a bit too seriously.
Saying that, I will still watch season 4 when it comes out and still complain that there was obviously no foreward planning for story arc across 4 seasons..."
781,"Season 1 was probably the best series that i've ever watched. Season 2 was great but i didn't really like the 7:th episode because in my opinion it was boring and if not it i would give season 2 a 10 too. Season 3 was in my opinon just good because of the colorized theme and not the like dark one that we saw in the previous seasons, and I think that the humour was kinda bad and the russians from the beginning was a good idea but they made them bad and unrealistic."
782,"The writing was pure film school, the acting was needlessly overwrought and the directing was nonexistent. I tried to like it, I really did, but I found myself fast-forwarding after the third episode.With the exception of the actress playing Eleven, the child actors were remarkably bad. The lead boy (who was cast no doubt for his physical resemblance to the original Elliott) was especially hard to watch. ""What's wrong with you?"" and ""What do you want from me?"" he screams. What a brat. And poor Winona Ryder, she chews the scenery episode after episode before settling into a quiet, huggy moment with Eleven, and suddenly you remember -- ""Oh, she was once a really fine actress. She was Abby in The Crucible! She seduced a young Daniel Day Lewis! But where has she been? And why is she working for children now?""If this thing continues, the Duffer boys should bring in a few guest directors, folks who understand the craft of directing well enough to tease out a performance here or there. And I'm sure it will continue, and everyone will just love it to death, and who cares about performance 'cause that's how we do it.Is Stranger Things the first I-GEN series? A series lifted ENTIRELY from prior media -- as opposed to, say, one's life experience? Remember life experience? It was the the original strange thing -- a thousand times stranger than media collage. Is Stranger Things thus, the first fully-sampled series? Are its ""writers"" merely humanoid precursors to the A.I.-driven algorithms that will soon be writing all of this stuff?No series should winnow down to multiple choice endings, but this one did, and to their credit (hence the second star), I guessed wrong. I really thought they'd rip off The Fury. I bet you, though, it was scripted that way until someone in accounting perked up and said, ""If you kill off your pervy, Cassavetes villain, satisfying as it would be, you'll compromise the bundle you're likely to make on a second season. The algorithm tells us so."
783,"Pathetic as shit. I don't understand why would any on watch this made up shit and wannabe mystery suspense thriller. In the 50 minutes of each episode we see communication among actors that seemingly building up the suspense and mystery but nothing but dialogues written for wannable and upcoming A list actors. There is no reason to put myself in the actor's shoes and that infuriated me more when we already know we are gonna get nothing from it.This is not even worth watching with family or friends . I felt they lacked enough story content . All the had was some kind of inter dimensional monster that is hardly even scary and take eons to build up the confrontation with protagonists through seemingly suspense building scenes but openly apparent that it is just another commercialization for the filthy rich audience to wow at how amazingly real it is. This is was so very infuriating that it takes excessive time to build up to the main part of the story and also even more infuriating that it happens in a nowhere village set n the 1980's. It was soo boring and people should stop recommending this crap. This has the perfect recipe to waste your time and assist you in your endaveour to become a social climbing gluttonous couch potato. Stranger thongs= boring things.
please stop recommending this people."
784,"I'm a fan of Stranger Things. Its yet another retro series but this one works for a whole variety of reasons where others have failed. First of all its well cast, with characters who have an 80's vibe. There's the stressed out working mother capably played by Winona Ryder complimented by a Goonies style group of kids who really fit their roles, right up to the 80's hairdo's and love of classically nerdy, Dungeons and Dragons. Its good stuff backed up by sound story lines that taps into a myriad of 80's films and television series with a sci fi, horror, conspiracy theory twist. All in all, there's a lot to like here and I hope as this series progresses, the nostalgia train rolls on offering more ""strange tales"" from the era of Ronald Regan, Thatcher and Pac Man. Eight out of ten from me."
785,Its so bad save ur time and the end was not good they just wanna make more money
786,"The tone of this show has greatly shifted from mystery-horror to comedy-horror, which is not what I signed up for in the first place.
S1 and S2 had a good storyline with the twists and turns, and the dialogue's witty, the direction is on point, the whole ensemble cast are perfect, the costumes, sets, score are all very fitting.S3 on the other hand, takes a different turn; most of the main characters are not at acting like themselves; Hopper and Joyce spend the entire binkering and nothing else, Steve can't talk to girls now, and do the parents even care about their children's whereabout anymore?And the Russian angle, urrgh it's so clichè, and they're portrayed as cartoonishingly evil. They pose no real threat, they are simply there to be outsmarted by our protagonists. And You can just go down to the their 'secret facility' whenever you want, and you'll never get spotted.The scene where Dustin and Suzie started to sing, was atrocious, instead on focusing on the protagonist's endangered lives they choose to waste everyone's suspension on basically nothing. It's a similar thing throughout the season that the characters don't seem to show proper seriousness. And also standing and looking shocked while they should be running for their lives, or the lives of their friends.Monster has many chances of killing people off but never do, mostly because every main character has plot armor and will be saved in the last-second-style clichè.While in the previous seasons, and especially in season one, it looked like there was some genuine effort put in accurately reproducing some of the 80's atmosphere, in season 3 this effort was really sloppy and negligent, if not totally abandoned.I really hope this show bounce back with S4."
787,"Season 1 hooked me with the suspense, mystery, and character dynamics. I couldn't wait to binge season two. Then they introduced Max and Billy and I couldn't stand those two. I know they had to be added for the sake of the story, but Max's bratty attitude and Billy the Bully rubbed me the wrong way. I liked Steve and Joyce's character growth in season 2. And Sean Astin, I knew he was going to die so Joyce and Hopper can get together, but I really wished he hadn't! He was so wholesome and good and the other characters needed that with all the darkness going on. RIP Bob. Season 3 started off as your average teen show, which made me cringe a lot. The scene where Hopper was trying to talk to Eleven and Mike about their relationship and Mike totally disrespected Hopper by mocking him - I would have immediately sent that boy home! Then there's the scene in the hospital where Nancy is running from the bad guys and keeps running into rooms instead of for the exit. Seriously?! And she and Jonathan see the two blobs about to merge - why not try to stop that? Throw some rubbing alcohol/something and light that nastiness on fire! Hit it with something?! Don't let it merge and get bigger! SMH. The whole idea that four kids/teens could penetrate and sneak around a maximum protection Russian facility is ridiculous, too. Where are the cameras? The patrols? Oh, and why did the adults allow two kids to serenade each other at one of the most dire times at the end of season 3? They should have just said shut up and give us the code! Ugh! Poor Steve, too. He thought he found another girl he could date (Robin) and she turns out to be a lesbian. The guy just can't win."
788,"Science fiction has finally given people a kind of shocking emotional power. The better it gets later, it fills a small hole but digs a bigger one, and there are still many mysteries in the first hole. A few little actors are very good. Middle school students are a little bit reminiscent of freaks and nerds."
789,"Stranger Things is one show that captures your eyes throughout its entirety. I can also say rather confidently that there is never a dull moment. With all of the character development, plot twists, and melodrama, it is a show that is easy to watch from start to finish without hesitation. The cinematography and videography is, at times, absolutely out of this world. Some of the scenes they created were absolutely iconic and will definitely leave an imprint on future generations. Overall, a highly worthwhile binge beyond all doubts."
790,"I really loved this so show. It is really worth watch. Very great characters. The thing that caughyt me about this show is the work of Jim Hopper. His character was just genuine as a cop. Usually we see in diffetent movies that cops don't play their role clearly but in this show, it is totally great. Very good characters like Eleven, Dustin, Mike, Lucas, Steve, Robin, Max, Will, Billy and Will's mom also did great job.Shows has really great clues and leads and those were all making great sense. I watched this show with my siblings and with them, we really enjoyed the show. At the end season 3, the speech scene was very emotional, it was great actually. Eargly waiting for the season 4."
791,"This show is a masterpiece! Transports you right back to childhood, to the beauty of simpler times. Season 1 is definitely the best season, though."
792,I love Stranger Things with all my heart. Its just simply amazing. The Characters and so great and well developed. I don't have any words to say about this series. Just don't waste anytime and go enjoy watching Stranger Things!
793,Just wow best series ever really glad to see this 👍
794,"God to watch, with good VFX, background scores. Story extending is also good, performances are pretty good. A good fun ride."
795,"Well, this is fabulous. You get involved in it one after another episode."
796,A very interesting series with a interesting characters
797,"Amazing show, can't wait for s4. Love the actors, very well casted."
798,"This is best Web Series Ever made with Good Emotional Touch and Good Building Of Characters. And also have An amazing Suspence, Thriller.Series Gets Even more Good As It Goes Further. This is the only Web series Contains Best Action, Romance, Thriller, Suspence, Sci-fi Plot."
799,I see people are complaining about the third season of this show but it's not justified here. You can't put the 3 stars or 5 stars to the whole show because you didn't like the third season. Be reasonable !
800,"The debut of ""Stranger Things"" in 2016 marked the first real, huge streaming TV phenomenon. Other Netflix shows had made an impression before: ""House of Cards"" in 2013 and ""Orange Is the New Black"" shortly thereafter proved that streaming was coming for cable's gig, hard. But it was the nostalgia grabs and exhilarating monster chases of ""Stranger Things"" that truly exploded in the zeitgeist - which is the only concrete factor we have to go on, given Netflix's famous reticence to disclose viewership numbers.Without a ton of pre-release press (the better to maintain its mystique), the Duffer Brothers' ""Stranger Things"" seemed to pop out of nowhere - a burst of a summer blockbuster sliced into palatable ""chapters"" like an addictive page-turner of an adventure book. Its 1983 setting, complete with myriad throwback references, was perfectly calibrated to tap into the significant strain of TV and movie fans who yearn for the onscreen ""Goonies"" adventures (or even star Winona Ryder) of their youth. For a while it was just about impossible to escape the show's signature images: an intrepid Dungeons and Dragons party (played by Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, and Gaten Matarazzo), a frantic mother (Ryder) and surly sheriff (David Harbour) decoding a wall of blinking lights, telekinetic heroine Eleven (breakout Millie Bobby Brown), glaring with a shorn head, steadily bleeding nose, and perhaps an Eggo waffle for extra strength.
The second season, which dropped on Halloween in 2017, tried hard to capture that original magic with a couple extra twists in the forms of hothead bully Billy (Dacre Montgomery) and his spunky kid sister Max (Sadie Sink). But the fact that the season was so highly anticipated inevitably spiked expectations so that when ""Stranger Things"" stumbled with a classic sequel blunder (""what if we did the same thing people loved so much last time, but bigger?""), it was even more of a disappointment.Enter Season 3. While ""Stranger Things"" will always have its diehard fans, this season has far more to prove about the show's overall longevity than any other. Debuting almost two years after season 2, but taking place several months after, the scrappy kids we first met three years ago are now gangly teens struggling to reconcile their childhood passions with their flailing hormones. Opposites-attract couple Nancy (Natalia Dyer) and introvert Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) are spending their summer interning at the local paper, while exiled prom king Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) rolls his eyes scooping ice cream at Hawkins' shiny new mall. Cary Elwes, an actor dogged by nostalgic fascination not unlike Ryder, taps in as the town's slimy mayor and perpetual Hopper adversary. Hopper himself (Harbour) is gritting his teeth while Eleven, now officially dating Mike (Wolfhard), tests his patience and ""keep the door three inches open at all costs"" rule.
As for what actually happens in season 3...well, it's almost impossible to say. Literally. The list of ""do not reveal"" spoilers Netflix sent alongside advance episodes is as long as it is strategic, prohibiting me from so much as hinting at who (or what) the determined citizens of Hawkins, Indiana are up against this time. The less the ""Stranger Things"" audience knows going in, the more exciting its twists and turns may be, so goes the wisdom following the first season's success.What I can reveal is that by the time the final credits roll on season 3 (plus a post-credits scene you won't want to miss), it's made much more of a case for itself than season 2 ever did simply by trying to be something different. The mall especially proves to be a rewarding new location that sets the stage for more inventive battles. Even displacing the action from the spooky grays of late fall to the saturated heat of midsummer shifts the tone and challenges the directors to convey creeping unease through Technicolor sweat. Later scenes set in the manic frenzy of a Fourth of July carnival are so vivid you can smell the popcorn and funnel cake.The summer 1985 setting also emphasizes time has irrefutably passed, and season 3 does interesting work as it grapples with that fact. For one: Will (Schnapp), traumatized from his time in the Upside Down and always the group's most tender member, tries to slow his friends down as they obsess over girls. Steve tries to find his place in the world outside a high school hierarchy, challenged all the while by his unimpressed coworker, Robin (Maya Hawke). Max, a well-intentioned character who nonetheless often acts as a cipher for the ones around her, takes on the task of befriending and empowering Eleven, who's still trying to find an identity all her own. (Does this include a shopping montage to ""Material Girl""? You know it!)Three seasons deep, ""Stranger Things"" is also more comfortable leaning into character combinations that have proved successful in the past - like the enthusiastic odd couple pairing of Steve and Matarazzo's Dustin - in order to break up the action into separate stories that eventually converge. Before their inevitable final reunion, the core cast is split into four factions with varying degrees of success. On the frustrating side lie Dyer and Heaton, solid but uninspired in an investigation that takes its sweet time connecting to everyone else, and Ryder and Harbour, who have a prickly chemistry that proves grating when isolated. (It's unclear why Hopper also tends to cross the line from ""charming grump"" to ""sour jerk"" more this season, but he sure does.) Conversely, Sink and Brown tap into a giddy energy that makes a forced friendship feel more elastic and real, while Priah Ferguson, playing Lucas' wry younger sister Erica, quickly justifies her convoluted entry into the main cast. Keery, who boasts the show's best comic timing by a mile, gets a worthy scene partner in Hawke; their growing friendship is one of the season's unequivocal highlights.
Beyond that, there's not much more I can say without incurring the wrath of Netflix's Spoiler Upside Down. But rest assured: if I went into season 3 wondering how long ""Stranger Things"" can possibly keep this up, I left it assured that as long as the series keeps pushing beyond what initially made it work, it will have more story left in the tank yet."
801,"I love this show, highly recommended for Sci-Fi fans."
802,It's the best Netflix tv series and the best sci-fi mystery thriller series of all time. From amazing background music to brilliant cast and screenplay. Take a bow Duffer Brothers.
803,"Season 1. 9\10
Season 2. 9.5\10
Season 3. 8.5\10
I think season 4 should be 9\10"
804,"Ok .. I have only seen season 1 and I think it is a bit predictable.I had to just wait for the things to actuall happen in Ep7-8.
I don't think it deserves above 8 rating . It's good but not that good."
805,"This show is one of the few reasons I haven't cancelled my Netflix subscription yet. They've cancelled so many of my favorite shows. Especially in recent years. Anyways, just finished season 3. Stranger Things has such a good story, likable protagonists, good villains, intriguing storylines and some sweet sweet Nostalgia. It's like Stephen Spielberg meets Stephen King.The music is great, the tone and setting are amazing. The acting is pretty darn great. From both the kids and adults. I was legit expecting some so-so acting from the kids when I started watching but they genuinely surprised me. They're just so good. Perfectly cast. Winona Ryder is great. Love her. I'm glad this show put David Harbour in the spotlight. Such a good actor. Glad he's finally getting some recognition. The twists, turns and tension... this show nails it all.Edge of your seat stuff. Amazing action. The effects on The monsters is pretty well done. They look pretty great. The production value is amazing. Just a wonderfully well put together show"
806,"Amazing concept, keeps u engrossed till d last scene each episode.
Season 2 last episode was the best amongst all.Please dont watch season 3, stupid plot and unwanted comedy.I wonder why they didnt built up on Number eight character from season 2."
807,"What happened here?! This show was off the charts for s1 and s2. I absoloutely loved it,
But oh how the mighty has fallen."
808,"Season 1 of Stranger Things is the best season of any show I have ever seen. I am literally in love with the tone and pacing of the show. Every episode had me in it's grips. Season 2 was good. Season 3 had it's moments but the tone drastically changed. Characters changed. And over all the plot was weak. I still liked it it's just changing the show so much was not necessary. and there is so much to explore with the upside down, Will, and Eleven's powers, the organization that created them and the other numbers.Season 3 felt like they stopped trying. It's not the actors faults. They did great. It was bad writing and directing. On a positive note the Creatures looked awesome.9 stars out of 10 with one star removed for S3."
809,"Stranger Things used to be my favourite TV show. Period. It was scary, had very emotional moments, immensely lovable characters with amazing character development and a wonderful story. Season 2 wasn't as strong as the first but was certainly enjoyable and had many great episodes. Season 3 on the other hand...yikes. They dropped the ball HARD with Season 3; creating a cringe-fest of bad humour, questionable character decisions and scenes that were just hard to watch as someone who loves these characters to death. I do hope they can redeem themselves in Season 4. But overall, what else is there to say? It's a fantastic show, even with its third season just being there. It's scary, emotional and very enjoyable. Hopefully Season 4 is better."
810,"We seen so much Friendship in Season 01. But coming to the Season 03 they are broken & fell in love with girls, in season 03 there are so much kissing, so much love sick & no mystery left.. we need season 04 more better than season 03.."
811,"As I said that first 2 seasons are really thrilling and have good story telling. I don't know what happened to that in the 3rd season. In the beginning episodes I thought that it's just warming up and the real story would start soon, but the warm up just continued till the last episode. There is overacting, forced humor, specially with Hopper and Joyce. What were they thinking while sending a little girl through the vent? The kids are really smart.. Fine, but things should be a bit realistic and sensible.
It just looked like there was no story at all. They are trying to stretch the Mind Flayor concept too far."
812,"The whole season 3 is made for money and its surprisingly bad compared to first 2 seasons. quality is bad, story is not bad, the only thing i like about this season is relationship between steve and robin till i realize robin is lesbian cmon dude why they cant do anything without sjw ?"
813,"Stranger Things is a series that took the world by surprise; delivering a simple premise, but executing it in an exceptional way, it became a series of great quality that remains constant in its design, expressing itself both superficially and profoundly in the field of nostalgia and cool visuals.Set in the 80's, does a magnificent job to bring to life the aspects of that era, placing and creating details as small as large that only helps to visualize in a fantastic way the theme of the series. Combining terror with classic archetypes, he manages to deliver a series that is highly entertaining, original and fantastic to admire. Finally also, we have children's characters that do not become extremely annoying or cliches, but on the contrary, we begin to adore them for their fantastic performances and their wonderful chemistry.A series like no other that fills the heart with fantastic moments and at the same time keep us in tension with their story of terror and fantastical narrative."
814,I just finished season one and am in the middle of season 2. This is probably one of the best shows on Netflixs. I read some of the low reviews and it's almost like they were hired by HBO or Disney to slam Netflixs. The kids are believable and the story is fun to watch. It reminds me of Stand by me crossed with a scary movie. If you like 80's scifi then you'll love this show.
815,"I love everything about Stranger Things. Season 1 , 2 and 3 , coming soon , are the best for me. Must watch before you die."
816,"Now, if you are looking for a show to watch this is it! It's the best thing I have watched in years, it will not disappoint, I promise!"
817,I love the 80's and this show has some of the best things of the era. Add some Aliens and meddling kids and it's a good show. I cannot wait for more.
818,"I'm not a lover of sci-fi/fantasy, but I really enjoy this show. I read a lot of reviews saying it's for kids, but I feel like older folks like myself may enjoy it more. All of the 80s movies this tapped into (Stand By Me, ET, Poltergeist, etc) really kinda pulled me in. It felt a little slow at the beginning, but once the pace picked up, the momentum continued to gain speed. It's a great cast, but Millie Bobby Brown (aka 011) is amazing! She beautifully portrayed some intense and emotional scenes for such a young girl. And Noah Schnapp was phenomenal at expressing the trauma he's enduring with his connection to the upside down!I'm not sure why it took so long for me finally binge both seasons, because much of it was filmed in my hometown. I drove past a local restaurant on the way to work one morning and saw several police cars with lights flashing and the sign covered in Oct 2015. So, I Googled what was going on and read about the show filming and thought it sounded very interesting. For some reason it took 3 years to finally watch, but I'm very glad I did. I actually enjoyed the fantasy aspect, and that's saying something!"
819,"Awesome,nice job,Stranger thing is the perfect series I ever watch,really miss that genre,I hope a lot more seasons"
820,"The first season was really good. I never knew what was going to happen, and everything felt fresh. The second season was basically a retelling of the first, but everything is BIGGER this time."
821,"Stranger Things is an original TV show from Netflix which was released in July 15 of the year 2016. The main actors of the cast are Winona Ryder (who plays Joyce Byers), David Harbour (who plays Jim Hopper), Finn Wolfhard (who plays Mike), Millie Bobby Brown (who plays Eleven), Gaten Matarazzo (who plays Dustin), Caleb McLaughlin (who plays Lucas), Noah Schnapp (who plays Will), Natalia (who plays Nancy) and Charlie Heaton (who plays Jonathan).The air of the athmosphere in the Stranger Things is from the 80s , which means the music, things, food, clothes, board games, weapons are from those years.In the TV Show, there are several creepy and bizarre moments that often appear monsters, aliens, slimes and supernatural stuff. All of these bring to us a science fiction TV show which I really appreciated it.I've already seen the entire TV show some months ago, thus I do recommend to watch with popcorn as well as some company.Some extra information: I've been waiting a lot for the 3rd season and I'm so exciting that is going to be debut on July 4 of this Year (2019)"
822,"I really don't understand why people love this series so much.I think it is just ""popular culture"".Some people say they love it even if they don't like it."
823,"This is a great series well worth watching..but for kids today it's historical..this is what we used to do...meet up..ride bmxs...talk..have adventures...
A great series, very well acted.
Turn off your phone and go outside!!!! :D"
824,"The first season of those show was phenomenal. Loved it. Very nostalgic. Unfortunately the second season fell a little flat for me, and that is because the main antagonist (Matthew Modine's character) is not seen in the second season. I think that is what sent the show downward. I think viewers could identify more with a human antagonist than "" the darkness form another dimension etc"" that has no real motive that we can understand vs what we can all understand might be Dr Brenner's motive."
825,"I love it! The acting is amazing,the story line is amazing....It's really unique and interesting!I've been watching movies and series my whole life and this is one of the best series i've ever watched!"
826,"After watching the opening episodes of the German series DARK, it came crashing down upon me how tedious, unengaging and wearily familiar Stranger Things is. I am smack bang in that generation that grew up with John Carpenter, Stephen King, David Cronenberg, Spielberg, Joe Dante and every 1980s pop culture and social reference Stranger Things nods to (or perhaps relies upon) as it crawls along its way. Am I meant to be the target audience, or is it the generation after mine, which had and inkling of these films but instead had the misfortune to grow up in the 1990s and not see them there and then?Or is it aimed at the (pre)teens of today for whom the 1980s are as old as the 1950s were to me? With only a vague sense of what the 80s were, this new audience might only experience a period piece that is quite slow (not slow-burn, but simply, tedious) and a bit old fashioned. It's not really that scary either, especially by today's standards.Consider John Carpenter's The Thing from 1982: an original and (for a monster movie) intelligent reboot of a 1950s 'classic', for want of a better word. Carpenter took the paper thin sets and man-in-a-monster-suit of the original and employed (then) cutting edge effects and (then) shocking imagery to fully entrench the story in the present.Stranger Things, on the other hand, retains everything: the look, the plot, the actors (Paul Reiser, Matthew Modine), the music, the titles, the effects and even the font, which has left a wave nostalgic graphic designers in a swoon. The problem with structuring a series as a complete, faithful recreation of those 1980s sci-fi/horror films, is that most of those films were not that particularly good to begin with. And in the 1980s, the essentially b-grade pay-off to any given plot was revealed after a blessed 100 minutes or so. With ST (and most of these overly long series) it takes 8-10 hours.So my issue with ST is that it seems it's only aim is to emulate the feeling and the cliches of the 1980s sci-fi/horror genre without seeming to add anything more. It has no depth. It's all sauce. Every aspect is so familiar and so faithful to the original source, that it feels as though you are actually watching clips of films you have already seen, when you were 10 years old, that weren't that great, but you liked them because you were still a child.The cast is earnest, but as with the everpresent juvenile casts of the 80s (that ST faithfully emulates), the limits to the acting abilities of an ensemble of pre-teens are often apparent. And any scene with Winona Ryder is simply painful.If you haven't yet begun to watch Stranger Things, I recommend that you not start. Instead, head over to the town of Winden on the other side of Netflix and give DARK a try. It's not Germany's answer to Stranger Things. It's simply better. And they speak German. So it's good."
827,"This show is like so good and gives us fans all we really wanted! Finn Wolfhard and the cast is so good! The Plot Is so Intriguing, and Interesting! Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven Is Fantastic! I Love The 80's Era so Making this show set in the 80's was Great! I Love The Idea Of An Alternate Reality or Universe! David Harbour is so good As His Character Jim Hopper. Overall This show DESERVES Praise for it's Unique Idea and story! 10/10"
828,"El's entire life has been unimaginable horror. Despite that she still has a good heart and we want so bad for her to have a normal life. I love watching her learn about friends and more normal human relations (the good and the bad).All of the kids are great so it was hard to shine so brightly in that company. She does. El is by far my favorite character and Millie does her perfectly. She gets communicating through facial expressions, the blank naive look, little smiles once in a while, and when Mike is hurting the anguish on her face sucks me in every time.I can think of a few other examples of the perfect actor getting the perfect role; Richard Harris' natural quiet authority as Dumbledore, Marisa Tomei as the smart confident Mona Lisa Vito in My Cousin Vinny, the entire cast of Firefly, and of course Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia... Millie Bobby Brown as El is at or near the top of that list.I've been around a while and seen a lot of sci-fi. I rarely comment publicly. I had to for this performance of this character. Ms. Brown, I fervently hope you are rewarded by your profession for this work."
829,"Even with the old concepts of ""upside down"", and people with special powers, the show seems refreshing and doesn't disappoint at all. It catches your attention in the very first episode, and you get really hooked to it gradually.The characters are highly believable and strongly thought of. Even though the story line seems a bit familiar to a lot of old horror movies and stuff, somehow the show manages to make it fresh and interesting.The mix of adults, teenagers and kids all investigating their own way finally leading to the common ground works really fine. Even though there are sub stories of the characters going on, the show remains focused and also makes things exciting enough to keep you glued in.With the introduction of 11 and 10 in strong ways the future of the show looks bright with a possibility of all the special kids coming together in future to fight a common enemy. Whatever happens in the show next, it is able to garner curiosity. This show is truly one of the best this year."
830,What is there not to like about Stranger Things. Its like E.T. and the X Files birthed a show. The nostalgic 80's feel and the sci fi make this a must watch for anyone who enjoys Science Fiction. The young actors are incredibly gifted and you will fall in love with all the characters in the show!
831,"There were many things about this season that were quite different from the first season. The first seemed to be more of a mystery where this one was more horror. All in all, there were good scenes with both character and story progression. Eleven's story, at one point, seemed to move in a different direction, but it came back to the main by the end of the season. The final episode makes some slower episodes worth the wait. I am anxiously awaiting the next season!"
832,"Stranger Things 2 occasionally struggles with balancing its time between new and old characters, and the first three episodes have to labor through a degree of catch-up that slows down the pace. Once the series picks up momentum, though, it's a thrilling ride. The Duffer Brothers have acknowledged its tonal debt to Aliens (the casting of Reiser seems self- conscious in that regard), and they show a deft ability with the stylistic and structural traditions of horror. But they also demonstrate a commitment to going deeper into the darkness—to use it not just for cheap thrills, but for true psychological investigation. In that, Stranger Things 2 is much more than a sequel. It's a thoughtful and compelling trip into unknown territory."
833,"I actually do NOT want to put a spoiler in here.watched this show with my 12 and 14 year old boys and we were enthralled by it...made movie day and watched the first season in a weekend. Highly worth the watch and waiting for season two!The acting is so realistic it could have been MY kids! The plot is a bit out there and keeps you guessing, but hey..that is the point...."
834,"By far the best series I have ever watched and I can't wait for season 2. Just watch it, you wont be disappointed. The casting, the acting the 80's feel, it all makes it better. The sci-fi and horror works great. The cast is really good and so the overall quality is. **Spoiler Allert**Eleven dying at the end just before kissing the boy made me cry."
835,"Stranger Things is what I consider to be the best Netflix original series to date. Not only does it include references to the works of Steven Spielberg, Wes Craven, Stephen King, and many other prominent creators of the 70s and 80s, But also features relate able, and well developed characters that are all given so much to do. No one in the series feels unnecessary or just thrown in, they all have good character motivation and they don't just do things for no reason. Even when a character does do something that is kind of dumb you can at least see where there coming from.There are much more things about this series that's great, but, I don't want to spoil anything, and I kinda wanna keep this as short as possible, so all I can say is that if you're a fan of any of the writers and directors I previously named or just science fiction in general, then this series is definitely for you."
836,Stranger Things did in 2016 what 13 Reasons Why has done in 2017!! Took everyone by surprise and turned out to be one of the best new shows in their respective years!! 😎😎The four kids in Stranger Things act in a way not even the adults could... and that's what adds to the awesomeness of this show!! Consisting of only 8 episodes in the 1st season... a little less as you may think... but such less itself leaves you spellbound!! 😍😍The 2nd season of the show is scheduled to arrive in the second half of 2017 as the rumours say... which will be keen to set new landmarks for the supernatural genre for the TV shows!! ✌️✌️
837,"honestly didn't hear anything about this show and just decided to watch it on Netflix as something new and i fell in love with the series, the story is a new take on a lot of older tales but done in the most intriguing way, the cast (while some were unknown before this) are all absolutely fantastic, the characters are human, interesting and actually have a believable quality which makes you root for them all the way, the quality, sets, soundtrack, acting... everything just fits together like a puzzle perfectly showcasing this awesome story, i cant wait for more i have binge watched the 8 episodes twice over and i never once wanted to stop, amazing show, amazing cast and i hope that if you haven't given it a watch try it! it may just blow you away and if not then i hope you find something that gives you as much joy as this show gives me"
838,"Not only because I come from Durham, Stranger Things gets my vote for best and most creative new development in film and video in many years. The brothers Duffy have woven a masterful story over 8 one-hour episodes, and maintained both quality and attention throughout. My only beefs are the (nowadays usual) use of near-whisper or unintelligible sounds in the dialogue, and an over-use of Shalyman-like darkness in too much of the critical ""other-world"" scenes (and in some of the regular-world ones, such as the swimming-pool sequence). The use of blinking overall-lighting and flashing light-darkness is also overdone, and distracts from several critical scenes. For film-makers this early in their game, these shortcomings are distracting but slight compared with their success in the storyline and general excellence in production. Hoping to be around long enough to see their talents develop fully."
839,"Those who criticize the show stating that it lacks originality are right - it's yet another scary story about a monster hunting residents of a small town. But if you serve this unoriginal plot in a way it has been served by the Duffer brothers, the results is pretty amazing. The soundtrack, which accompanies most of the key moments of each episode, doesn't let you forget that the action takes place in the 1980s, and in my opinion it is one of the most important factors that makes the show great. Another advantage is the way all the key characters are set up. In the very first episode we can get to know their personalities due to an amazing performance of the exceptionally talented actors and the witty dialogues between them. I've never thought I'd be into that type of show but I'm more than happy that gave it a try."
840,"Let's get it out of the way: yes, it's not perfect. There are some special effects that don't look so special. Few details here and there, for sure. Original? Not quite. But this is a 10. It cannot be less than a 10.First of all, it's pure nostalgia. The bikes, the clothes, the music, the board games; the vibe of that era is all there. Make no mistake, the main character of this series is not 011 – it's the 80's. The casting is stellar – everyone, but specially 011, shine on screen. The direction, the photography, the pace – everything just works. And nothing feels like filler.It takes something special to have Stephen King and Guillermo del Toro praise it. Believe us; it is.By the time of this writing, Netflix is yet to confirm S2. Even if it doesn't come, this was a breath of fresh air to television (it's not really television, but you know what I mean.)"
841,"It is set in 1983 Indiana, where a young boy vanishes into thin air. As friends, family and local police search for answers, they are drawn into an extraordinary mystery involving top-secret government experiments, terrifying supernatural forces and one very strange little girl.The Duffer Brothers have done an amazing job of combining the differing tones of Mystery,sci-fi , super natural elements,friendship,family,comedy,horror.It keeps you on the edge of the seat throughout the show.It creates an environment from the first scene which helps viewer to involve in the narration. There may be other equally great shows to watch , but I guarantee you won't have more fun watching any of them than you will watching Stranger Things."
842,"Only two episodes in and it's very apparent that a lot of love went into this show. The casting is blowing me away. The sets are incredible. Just awesomesauce everywhere. They have teens doing at least half of the acting and they come across as so authentic. Winona Ryder is the most recognizable face in Stranger and she is completely immersed in her role. Zero ego, she shines as a single 80s mom in an impossible situation. He emotional performance makes the story come alive.There is a nearly perfect blend of drama, horror, sci-fi, and all balanced by a fun sense of humor. The 80's nostalgia is strong. I hope they borrow a page from American Horror Story and come with different themes for many seasons to come."
843,I don't understand how can someone over 14 yrs old like this show.
844,"This show is essentially pandering to the masses who want something mindless and nostalgic that wraps up in a predictable, anti-climactic bow. Stranger Things does not deserve to share the same ratings with a masterpiece like True Detective. The acting is annoyingly terrible. The plot is predictable and disappointing. But if you're looking for a a feel-good, nostalgic 80s vibe - yet want to also feel like you're watching something edgy and creepy (which this isn't) then go for it. There was a point in one of the episodes where Nancy and Jonathan are shooting bottles and I said ""He's going to miss, then she's going to hit the bottle on her first shot, turn and give him a coy smile, and then its going to immediately cut to the next scene."" And that was literally shot for shot what happened. Is this a testament to me being psychic, or that this show is utterly predictable?The only thing that kept me watching until the very end was a hope that there would be some sort of interesting, clever turn - some sort of intelligent explanation for the events that beg all of the questions. But nope. The explanation that they give is so dull that my eyes nearly rolled out of my head. The whole concept of the sheet of paper, and the ""upside down."" Look, I love fantasy. And I'm all about accepting when there are things you aren't meant to know, but this was just annoying. And don't get me started on the child actors. They can't conduct a scene without escalating to full blown yelling within 20 seconds and frankly - its annoying as hell. Of course you can't expect Oscar winning performances from children, but the Directors here could have provided at least the simple direction to not be yelling 99% of the time. I literally made an account on IMDb just to make this review. I feel like I'm the only person out there who sees this show for being the total crap that it is."
845,"Glacially-paced show plays like 30-year-old Spielberg outtakes – without the fun and charm. Cliché characters and scenes right from Close Encounters, E.T., and Goonies. And Poltergeist too. A Jaws poster hanging in a kid's bedroom is a nod to the show's vintage roots – and a scene that follows soon after. (Come on down here and chum some of this sh**!) The premise has got more than a little of Stephen King's It.Every cliché in the book is here: the d**chebag boyfriend and idiot friends, the cute virginal girl who is coming of age and her geeky big-boned friend, the Goonies-like tweens and the bullies that persecute them, the creepy introvert, the slow sheriff who grew up in town, and the a**hole G-Men. It's deja vu all over again – in not a good way.Winona Ryder's shrill, hysterical, nicotine-addicted mom grates on my nerves like nails on a chalkboard.Millie Bobby Brown, who was so cute in Intruders, is going to be a huge star very soon.It's great to see Matthew Modine. When did he turn 90?Add a star if you like 80s hair styles and pop culture."
846,"Enough said. But since I have to write a review, I will say this series is NOT in the league of Game of Thrones, which IS worthy of the high 9 rating. Sorry to say, but it's pretty much every cheesy 80's sci-fi B/Horror movie wrapped in one, with equally cheesy Goonie-ish actors. I gave it a slightly above average rating for the acting ability of the Eleven..the other kids constant, loud bickering and cliché teenage love/angst was getting unbearable by the 5th episode with no reprieve in the episodes that follow... Ryder & Modine did a decent enough job. The only thing which really irked me with Ryder was the awful shaggy haircut she had."
847,"The best season in terms of quality, humour and especially the story developing. The cast is amazing and the addition of robin and erica proved to be a an ace of spades. If you have watched the first two season, you are going on an amazing ride which leaves you crying and moving forward!"
848,"I loved this Series a Lot. It's full of Thrill. The way the Story Runs, it's become more interesting. Millie Bobby Brown is the Highlight of the Series. The Screenplay is lit 🔥. The Characters played by Mike, El, Lucas & Dustin are also good. I think this series deserves more Respect. As we know some illiterate will rate this Series 1/10 because they Don't know English 😂. At the End, This Series is Superb and Entertaining. You Should watch this Series Because it's worth watching."
849,"There are always people that complain when anything gets to creating sequels. When a show, movie series, band (etc.) get round to creating a second and third they are always hounded with ""why has it all changed, why can't it all be the same as the first time"". It is not even that they dislike it, if it came out stand-alone it would be adored but for some reason, because they have changed in some way, it is an abomination. This series moved on from these characters being children to teens, slowly taking on responsibility and feeling less invincible. You can see comparisons when the now-teen gang talk with a much younger newer addition and how their mindset has changed to allow for accountability. The idea that anything has to be like the simpsons, where no one changes or adapts, grows up or has a personality altering experience baffles me. If you take a step back, look at the progression and potential of the characters and the realism sewn into the dialogue and emotions of each character, and get away from ""it's not the same, wahhhhh"", you might actually begin to enjoy sequels. The mentality that nothing can live up to the original damages the industry and is wholly untrue. Directors, producers, writers and actors grow and it will never be the same feel, you can only take a step back and enjoy it. Granted this can go horribly wrong (GOT S8, ew) but in this case it is truly growth and development of characters that push this show into a strong standing for a season 4."
850,"I won't write long, because it is my first review on IMDb. I've just finished watching Stranger Things. I am so agitated... I need more. Oh God, I need so more. I haven't watched so good series for a long time. Everything in it is perfect, even music. The girl who plays Eleven is perfect. I don't know if someone could play it better. Millie Bobby Brown did a great job and now her ""star gate"" is for sure open. Friendship between Mike, Dustin and Lucas is so believable and realistic. Like I was watching best friends on screen. Dustin! Dustin is such a great guy! Gaten Matarazzo did also great job. Oh Lord. I don't know what else should I write. I think that's it. Now I'm gonna lay down on my bed and think all Sunday about everything. This is the series of 2016. And YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS. NOW.IMMEDIATELY."
851,"Netflix delivers another amazing original series with Stranger Things. The show mixes science fiction, horror, adventure, mystery, and teenage romance while throwing in lighthearted comedy and a deeper emotional core. It hearkens back to the Spielberg films with an optimistic undertone and a small town 1980s setting. I enjoyed every episode and the momentum rises all the way to the last shot of the first season. I sincerely hope this show returns for another round.This Netflix series is just great, fun, entertaining, stunning special-effects, and a plot that will blow viewers away. The acting is wonderful and brings to life characters that are easy to root for. Plenty of laughs to be had throughout and each episode ends with a cliffhanger that makes this show incredibly bingeable.The show has plenty of intense scenes of horror and utilizes every moment of the eight episodes to push the story along. The Duffer Brothers have delivered a gem capitalizing on nostalgia and delivering a fun, yet complex plot. Anyone with a Netflix subscription should check this show out and I'll be shocked if you don't enjoy it.After season 2: Netflix's 80s tribute and sci-fi adventure returns with another great season of monsters, twists, and a charismatic cast. The film begins with a bizarre scene where a group of punks flee including Kali (Linnea Berthelsen) who shares a similar tattoo to Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) continues to reach out to Eleven over the radio but he never hears anything. Eleven is hiding out in a cabin with Jim Hopper (David Harbour), kept isolated from nearby Hawkins. Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) are obsessed over a mysterious MadMax who continues to beat their high scores. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) has some residual effects of staying in the upside down for so long and will warp into the other dimension to see a giant monster approaching. His mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) worries for her son and has started a new relationship with Bob (Sean Astin), a technology expert.Mike's older sister Nancy (Natalia Dyer) continues to try to learn more about her missing friend Barb, enlisting of Will's older brother Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) much to the detriment of her relationship with Steve Harrington (Joe Keery). The new characters in town are Maxine (Sadie Sink) aka Max who has been beating Dustin's high scores and her bully of a stepbrother Billy (Dacre Montgomery). As the monster slowly creeps towards Will, stranger things happen around Hawkins even as Chief Hopper makes an arrangement with the Department of Energy's new project leader Dr. Sam Owens (Paul Reiser). Pumpkins patches are dying and the scientists continue to try to burn out the encroaching substance from the dimension hole. Halloween comes as the boys dress up as Ghostbusters. Jonathan is supposed to watch Will but he leaves to hang out with Nancy at a party where she has got obnoxiously drunk and fought with Steve.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
852,"I've finally decided to write my first review, because I think the reviews of Stranger Things need to be balanced a bit from someone who doesn't think it's way up there with all the 8, 9, 10 star reviews.Stranger Things opens just great. During the first half of the first episode I was really impressed by the look and feel of the show, and the story just brought me in. They nailed the 80'ies feeling quite well. The intro and music feels very authentic (although in shining HD). One of my favorite things was that they've toned the actors down to look less like movie stars, and more like ""regular"" people like you or I. The look of most 80'ies homages feel a lot less authentic than Stranger Things, where you feel that they've only just added enough of an 80'ies style to get away with it, but it still feels like everything's been modified enough to feel modern. Stranger Things avoids this and that's a very good thing.Now, for the story, I don't think it quite held up all the way through. I found myself losing interest after a few episodes. In my opinion, they gave away too much, too soon. The mystery disappears after a while, and over time the show started feeling more like a low-budget show. The direction of the show also felt somewhat all over the place. The story is told mostly through the eyes of kids, but there's enough violence and scary parts that I don't think kids are the target audience. Like, for example, The Walking Dead, it's violent and horror-y in a way that's toned down just enough to feel safe and PG and I found that quite distracting. I get a strong Super 8 vibe from this show, but it feels less consistent in what audience it's really trying to appeal to. Obviously, this show has turned out to appeal to most of you, so my opinion is probably not all that common, which is one of the reasons I felt I should write this review.The acting is decent most of the time. I don't think it'll win any awards or anything, but it doesn't distract, with a couple of exceptions. Winona Ryder feels surprisingly misplaced and I had expected a lot more from her. I didn't really like the acting of Charlie Heaton either, but I suppose it could have been a matter of directing as well. All of the characters are somewhat cliché, which I don't think is a problem. Actually, I think that's what they have been aiming for. This is a homage to 80'ies horror and I think it's a good choice that the characters are the typical characters you find in those old films.Got to mention again: the intro, wow! I love it. It's incredibly good looking and it sets a great mood immediately.I gave this a pretty average score, on the low side, because of two things. One: The script. It lost my interest over time. In the long run, it didn't keep the mystery that the opening episode promised going. Two: it was very unclear to me who this was aimed to appeal to. It feels very matinée in quite a few sequences, but I think the target audience is supposed to be adults.Anyway, I didn't hate it, and as I'm not one of those guys that raves about it or totally hates it, I tried to be a bit more nuanced in my review. But I'm very certain that I won't be seeing this again, and I think that in a year or so, this will be a show that I have pretty much forgotten about."
853,"I am giving it 1 rating just to balanced out the too much high ratings. Honest rating would be 3/10. Pathetic acting (except vininna Ryder). Weak plot, funny special effects. Stretching a simple story too much. Italy be good watch for 7-8 year old kid not beyond that. It's funny they keep in bringing the same story again and again just number of stranger things changes"
854,"Its a great show from netflix.
I has moment which will made you laugh, and some for horror, so its perfect for binge watch.
For binge watch i like shows which has some suspense ( because its the only thing which hooks me till the ending), but it should also have some comedy so that its not frustrating.
So overall its a great show, for binge watch."
855,"The writing is so good. The characters are amazing. I like all 3 seasons, but season 3 is not that good than first two. Cast is pretty good."
856,"Back when Millie Bobby Brown has turned 13 years old, I started watching Stranger Things in the living room, then I went back to watching it with my parents. The first time I saw someone wearing Stranger Things merchandise is that one girl from my Art class. She is wearing a black t-shirt with white letters that show the characters' names. But when Season 2 came out, it was awesome. I like how the boys were wearing their Ghostbuster uniforms. It wasn't long before Season 3 had arrived. Let me tell you about the series, I really loved it! While new characters like Alexei, Max, Erica, Billy and Robin have arrived, I am starting to like them.I loved how Steve and Billy has changed throughout the series. I hated how Steve is a total jerk, but changed as a pretty cool babysitter. The same goes to Billy, except that he is now a lifeguard. I understand why do people whose name start with the letter ""B"" keep dying in mysterious ways. Erica can be like an annoying little sister to Lucas, but I am so glad she changed.The episodes are awesome. My favorites have to be ""The Body"", ""The Upside Down"", ""Trick or Treat, Freak"", ""The Gate"", ""Suzie, Do You Copy?"", ""The Mall Rats"" and ""The Battle of Starcourt"".And as for the fashion, well, the outfits in the first season reminds me of the 1970s, the second season reminds me of the 1960s and the third season totally screams '80s (especially everything Max and Eleven wears)!Oh, and didn't I forget to mention about the scenes? I loved how Eleven stole all of the Eggos, the van getting flipped by Eleven, the Snow Ball scene, the Party trick-or-treating, and of course, going shopping with Eleven.The series overall is like a mix of The Goonies, the Alien franchise and The Thing with a touch of every other Stephen King novel/movie and Steven Spielberg movie ever."
857,It's a thin line between sciences and nature. and good portrayed of modern relationship through humor
858,"In a small town where everyone knows everyone, a peculiar incident starts a chain of events that leads to the disappearance of a child, which begins to tear at the fabric of an otherwise peaceful community. Dark government agencies and seemingly malevolent supernatural forces converge on the town, while a few of the locals begin to understand that there's more going on than meets the eye."
859,What a amazing web series and specially Eleven is my love and crush she is so cute. Season 1 and season 2 is really awesome and creative. Love relationship mike and eleven is beautiful. Dustin was a funny character. Love relation between max and lucas is so funny but i loved it. Wee see a pain of mother and brother its very emotional. This web series proof power of friendship . Season 3 is so much suspense and emotional when Billy and jim was dead i cried. And the climax scene was so heart touching and painful when all friends got separated. My tears were not wept. All over I am speechless about this web series. FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE
860,This show is the best there is it has a little bit of everything for EVERYONE theres action theres adventure theres sci fi horror and even romance please watch this show you will not regret it
861,"Okay. First, let me confess, I didn't want to watch it because I've a little 'uggghhhh' feeling inside towards zombie-type movies, maybe because they don't make sense at all. That's why I find most zombie movies as silly. But Stranger Things, wow, this is not like conventional zombies v/s human world movies but rather more advanced & immersed version of that.Stranger Things takes you back to the '80s where a couple of friends & families of Hawkins, a fictional town based in Indiana, becomes the victim of a flunked scientific experiment carried out by Hawkins Lab. Right from the Season 1, it got me hooked in & completely invested in the story. All lead characters are well developed & are amazingly played by the actors, you may end up get attached with a few & start feeling what they are feeling. I loved the talented child crew that plays Mike, Justin, Will, Eleven, Dustin & Max. They are the real elegance of the show & infuse the right amount of charisma & banter.The show maintains its unpredictability, thrill & horrors for the first two seasons. Few moments might also leave you on the edge of your seat & get your fingertips cold. But Season 3 is, what I personally think, where the show starts taking off. It's filled up with lots of things which hardly make sense including the non-seriousness in a very tense situation, children playing the role of agent 007 & the monster which reminded me of zombies which I already mentioned I hated. S3 stayed predictable as well most of the time. Still, I loved it all the way through. Loved the ending which was relatively sad.It's must-watch stuff if you love being startled. Stranger Things is scary, fierce, thrilling, and will leave your heart pounding in the chest. I would keep it at 9/10."
862,Each season became more and more epic to me. I feel emotionally connected to the characters and am always on the edge of my seat not knowing what to expect! The acting is wonderful and the filming has a fantastic colourful quality that I can't get enough of!! Great show all around! Can not wait for season 4
863,"I love this show, and think it is well written and well- portrayed. It is a a great reminiscence of the 80s ( even though I'm not that old I can appreciate it) 95% recommend because it's a tad scary, and it's only going to get worse from here because of the nature of the show. But it would still be good even if it were worse because it was that good to begin with. you know?"
864,"El and Jim are soul of the show...
The story evolves and gets better with every season..
Excellent Screenplay..different parts of the story unravels simultaneously and finally, the pieces combine to form a complete picture..."
865,"I typically don't like Netflix shows. But this, this is amazing. I feel like I'm in the 80s, as corny as it sounds. I love the characters, setting, the demogorgen (I'm sorry if I spelt that wrong) the mind flayer, the story, just amazing and truly, the best of netflix."
866,Acting was mediocre the only person that stood out was hopper (well for the first 2 seasons) and then season 3 made him a grumpy dad who didn't care about anything. The Story is decent but not the best I felt it kept dragging especially in season 3. Some of the dialog was cringe and mike is so annoying it hurts I tried to rewatch it and I barley made it past season 1 because of mike. Overall worth a watch but just don't analyse
867,"Seasons 1&2 so perfect!!!!season 3 I like it very much and reminds me one of my favorite movie of 80s..""invaders from mars""(1986)...I can't wait season 4..."
868,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Stranger Things first appeared in our lives back in 2016 with its phenomenal first season, followed by a less amazing yet still entertaining Season 2. I was pretty excited for the third adventure with one of the best (if not the best) young ensemble casts ever. The acting in this show is unbelievable, even more when considering the age of most of the kids (14-17). Millie Bobby Brown is 15-years-old! Fifteen! Weirdly, the show will only be eligible for next year's Emmy's, but if she doesn't get nominated AND win, I sincerely don't know what she needs to do more. The seamless ease that Millie has in showing emotion and delivering those subtle expressions that only the best actors can achieve after years of experience ... She's going to break the Oscar record for youngest Best Actress / Best Supporting Actress winner. It's meant to happen.I started with her because last season I handed the highlight crown to Noah Schnapp (Will Byers) who also gives an excellent performance, even if his character has less to do this time around (similar to the debut season). Of all the young actors, Millie is so much ahead of her fellow colleagues that she indirectly diminishes Sadie Sink's (Max) performance. They have completely different emotional responses to similarly painful events. Not that Sadie isn't able to transmit her feelings (I enjoyed both her and her character a lot more this season), but jumping from Eleven showing 200% of her emotion to any other character is always going to feel that the other actor/actress isn't at her level (truthfully though, they aren't).In addition to Millie, the other standout has to be David Harbour as Jim Hopper. This might be the funniest season so far, as well as the most emotionally powerful. Both are due to Hopper's arc and Harbour's award-worthy performance. He's hilarious, happy, sad, angry, drunk, frustrated, proud, ... His arc is definitely the one that serves as a pillar to this season's structure. Without him, this season wouldn't be near to the quality it is. Harbour's chemistry with Winona Ryder (Joyce Byers) is palpable, and that's basically enough for me to have a great time. However, The Duffer Brothers really deserve a lot of credit. The writing is some of the best I've seen in the last few years.Everyone hated Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) in the first season, but his development got such a fantastic treatment that now everyone loves him. The same happens with Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery). I genuinely hated him last season due to how cliche and lazily written he was. Now, even though his backstory isn't anything innovative, he's undoubtedly seen as a more compelling character, which proves that Stranger Things really doesn't have a single bad character (main or supporting, at least). Max also gets a better script, plus her on-screen time with Eleven helped the character become more interesting. Nevertheless, how's the main gang?!Well, Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin Henderson) spends less time with his original friends, but his side adventure with Steve, Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson), and Robin Buckley (Maya Hawke), the newest addition to the show which is also the best surprise of the season, is also pretty entertaining even if it's connected to one of my issues (more on that soon). Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin), Will, Eleven, and Max have a whole romantic subplot that I surprisingly enjoyed mostly due to how realistic and heartfelt The Duffer Brothers wrote it. Obviously, comedy is always a must inside this group, and I wasn't disappointed, having dropped more than just a few laughs throughout the episodes.Finally, Charlie Heaton (Jonathan Byers) and Natalia Dyer (Nancy Wheeler) also have their own inspiring journey, the one that addresses the most how people had to live in the 80s. Dealing with discrimination, workplace injustices, and different lifestyles are put in perspective always through unforced dialogue and/or events. I really loved this season structure. How each group of characters has their own side adventure so that in the end, they can all team-up together to defeat the evil within Hawkins. I never felt bored or less engaged in a story. Season 2 had that horrible episode with Kali (Linnea Berthelson), and some episodes seemed to drag. Season 3 not only has the perfect runtime for each episode, but the story that they cover during each chapter is always remarkably captivating.Of course, I always felt more entertained when Eleven and Hopper were on-screen, so their subplots obviously became my favorites. However, they don't take anything away from the remaining stories or characters. Evidence number one would be the best ending of the show. It's hard to hold off the tears during those last few moments, especially if you went through the same event (which 99% of people definitely did unless you had literally zero friends growing up). Technically, the show proves that you don't need a big budget to provide visual delight. From the appropriated costume design to the addictive 80s' style soundtrack, everything is on-point with tons of practical effects being employed. The CGI regarding the monsters and everything that comes with them are convincing enough, and the action sequences are mostly shot well. The editing gets a little sloppy near the final episodes, but nothing too serious.My main and only issue with this season has to be the actual main plot. The thread that connects all of the subplots and groups of characters that I've been praising so much. Besides being very similar to the last season (monster comes, possesses people, and you know the rest), it's worse regarding the ""how"" and ""why"" the monsters came back. There's a whole story involving Russians, secret bases and codes, that feel too cheesy and over-the-top, reaching a level of absurdity that even affected some action scenes ""a la Fast and Furious"". It's unusual for the main plot to be as cliche and uninteresting as it is, while the side stories are astonishingly good.All in all, Stranger Things delivers yet another fantastic season. Its debut continues to hold the #1 spot, but Season 3 is so much better than its predecessor. Once again, the characters are what make this show a massive success. Even separating everyone into different groups, the cast's phenomenal chemistry remains intact. Millie Bobby Brown takes her crown back from Season 2's highlight, Noah Schnapp, and guarantees herself tons of nominations and hopefully a few awards, due to a perfect display of her emotional range. David Harbour is right behind her, and then comes the rest of the ensemble cast, one of the best to ever grace a TV screen. The Duffer Brothers are masterful screenwriters, presenting extremely developed character scripts, as well as funny, exciting and entertaining side stories. Despite a less strong main plot, Stranger Things finishes this season with the best ending of the entire series. If you're not crying during the last 10 minutes ... I don't know. Can't wait for Season 4, even if I would be more than satisfied to see it end its run now."
869,"I have to say that I didn't hate season 3 but it wasn't as good as season 1&2.It seems like the once really anxious writers lost interest in the series and half-assed the job.The first thing you notice is the massive change in the behavior of Jim. He was an introverted, slightly depressed but warm character in the first seasons. Now he is a clumsy,hoggish, irascible macho that shows no sign of tactfulness. He threatens Mike for being Elles boyfriend, constantly argues with Joyce (who he is in love with) and is constantly violent to people and even kills a lot of Russians with a machine gun without caring at all. Luckily the kids didn't change too much and the character of Murray develops to a real jewel.Speaking of russians. Yes, there are russians. A lot of russians. I guess the producers wanted to consequently install more typical clichés of 80s movies but imo they overshot the mark. All the time you see some russians who just kill and punch everybody, americans and their own people, who take the smallest peep at them. And they do without getting into trouble with the police or other authorities at all. And they are all dumb as f... Are they? Okay, they managed to build a huge research center disguised as a mall right in the middle of the USA but kill their most important scientist when an experiment is just half successful just to tell his replacement that he is next if he fails too (and they do). That really doesn't seem quite effective or smart. How the hell did they get the mall finished? And why do they want to open the gate again?But the most unnecessary thing is a Schwarzenegger-doppelganger on the russian side who moves, looks and talks like Arnold in the Terminator movies. This is not an 80s reference. This is dumb copying. Even one of the characters says in one episode as a joke that the guy is Arnold Schwarzenegger. Not very subtle.But I don't want to smash season 3 here. There have been some funny and exciting moments and alltogether I was entertained well. However I hope that the next season gets better again. If the writers proceed like this the show will go down the drain in no time."
870,"I'm not that good at reviews but I thought I'd leave one for Stranger Things. To be honest it took me 2 years to start watching this show and now I'm wishing that I started watching it when it first came out as I love this show. The acting is amazing, the graphics and everything is so good.There are some characters who make me so frustrated like Dr. Brenner, Billy, Tommy H, Carol, etc. But what show or movie doesn't have characters who the viewer would rather punch in the face?I also think they got it right, the 80s I mean, like I've noticed some 80s movie posters on the boys bedroom walls, like The Thing, The Evil Dead, Jaws, etc. The Terminator playing at the local cinema in 1984.There is just so much that I like about this show. Also how some scenes remind me of certain movies like Stand by me, Firestarter, ET, etc.That's pretty much it. Though I do have to say, if you're looking for something new to watch and have never watched this, then watch it. You won't regret it. This show is one of the best shows on Netflix."
871,"Becomes interesting from 1st episode itself and you just don't feel like stopping. I don't know why everyone here is not happy with season 3, I didn't feel it was any different from 1st 2"
872,"The show is a true gem. The way it slowly builds up the hype is amazing. This really impressed many, no doubt. The acting, execution, the dialogues, the VFX, the children, everything is just very good."
873,"Its a great show so far, currently I am on season one episode five, and im loving it !! love the old time feeling ! the kids are great actors and great characters ! its not too ""scary"" but still manages to be ""adult enough to watch while i think a young teenager could enjoy it just the same... and a bonus the blu rey/dvd at Target for seasons 1,2 looks like a VHS tape !! i hope Target keeps that up for as long as the show runs !"
874,"I'll start out by saying that Yes I will watch the 3rd season when it comes out. It has been an entertaining show but throwing around terms like ""masterpiece"" is wildly off base. This show fits perfectly in the box of ""decent shows to watch when you are running low on Netflix series to watch"". Lots of hype, which feels to me like people just hyping it up because some else hyped it up. Kind of like Andy Warhol art. At some point someone has to have the guts to say the art sucks. So, bring on season 3 and I'm sure I'll watch it out my left eye while I'm doing something else on the computer."
875,"Well I don't know how to explain. This is how every TV program should be like. Plot was amazing like reading a story book of Stephen king. Story was perfect, well performed, well acted, well directed, dialogues and performances of child actors are really appreciate able. I would 100% recommend Stranger Things to the people of every age."
876,"This review is for season 2, First season was a 9.5 for me. Its almost like they wanted to repeat season 1, but slightly different. So there were no real surprises, mystery or even suspense.Often parts were overplayed and overacted, cant say too much more without spoilers, but for me was somewhat disappointing.Edit: Just gone done watching season 3, and boy is it back on track. Wonder if they realized they ran off the rails for season 2.Season 3 every bit as good as the first."
877,"When the first season has garnered rave reviews & has developed a cult following, expectations from the second season of Netflix's hit Show were abnormally high. The Duffer brothers had tough job at hand & had to present a bigger & better second season in order to satiate their show's huge fan base's thirst for quality entertainment. But the Duffer brothers luckily do not disappoint. Netflix has perfected the art of producing quality drama shows & then churn out several seasons of their hit shows. The second season starts off on a high & answers a lot of questions unanswered in the first season. The script is excellent. The show manages to keep you involved & intrigued throughout. Finn Wolfhard (Mike), who probably shot for IT simultaneously, must be given credit for portraying two characters who are polar opposites of each other. Such maturity in acting at such a young age is commendable. Series regulars Winona Ryder(Joyce Byers) & David Harbour (Jim Hopper) continue to perform to our expectations. A few new faces are introduced & we are even told that a much loved character will be a part of the second season as well. The second season delves deeper into Natalie Dyer(Nancy Wheeler)- Charlie Heaton(Jonathan Byers) & Joe Keery(Steve Harrington) as well. The demons are bigger, scarier & more powerful than the first season. The camaraderie between the four friends will make you miss your childhood friends & bring back some pleasant memories from school. Gaten Matarazzo(Dustin) is endearing. Noah Scnapp(Will Byers) who did not have much of a role in the first season has a prominent role in the second season & gives a fine performance. Caleb Mclaughlin(Lucas Sinclair) does a good job of supporting the cast, although he doesn't have much of a role himself. He is probably cast for adding some ""color"" (pun intended) to the show. The makers have even added a dialogue on these lines. On the whole, the second season will remind you why you feel in love with the first season. The Duffer brothers have to be thanked for not letting us down. Netflix has been kind to add a recap before the first episode starts. The last two episodes are out of this world! We are having withdrawal symptoms already & cant wait for the third season!"
878,"Stranger Things is an impressive show with a beautiful homage to the 80's and clever sci-fi and horror themes mixed together. It feels like a Steven King story made by Steven Spielberg.Right from the beginning of Episode 1 you're intrigued and eager to find out what happens next. The story is a little slow, but it has plenty of twists and turns to keep everyone interested.The casting is extremely well done. The kid's acting is very impressive, especially from Millie Bobby Brown.My only problem is that Season 2 wasn't as good as Season 1. Don't get me wrong, it's still quality, it just can't live up to the expectations after such a fantastic first season. The Duffer Brothers said that the second season was going to be 'bigger and darker' and it seemed to get a bit out of hand. The plot is a bit lack-luster, and the stakes don't feel quite as high. It gets off to a slow start and is a bit confusing to follow. The finale was good but I was disappointed in the lack of screen time that the Mind Flayer got.The Eleven story arc is not only confusing but also disappointing, and her solo episode was unenjoyable and boring. This was upsetting because she was outstanding in the first season. Still, the second season is very well done, with each new character fitting in seamlessly. Max especially was a welcome addition to the team, adding a bit more fire. It's still a quality show and overall well worth a watch."
879,A perfect TV show needs 1)Breathtaking screenplay 2)Perfect score 3)Continuity in story 4)STORY***** Stranger things fulfills most of these things and it's great to see that.Sharing similarity with Stephen King novels it is chilling and mysterious... It is very similar to the movie 'IT' they share the same theme.. i loved the first season.. second season could have been better..
880,"Great show where everything is done right: casting, music, writing and visuals. The most eye-catching performance in the first season is a superb Winona Ryder, the second season doesn't have any particular star but introduces some interesting newcomers. The show is chock full of flashbacks to the 80s and not just because it takes place in 1984 but often winks to sci fi classics from the 80s via movie posters, toys (of course, everybody has the Star Wars Kenner toys) dialog references, little TV fragments (The Thing) and what not.The small town setting, which much attention to the personal woes of it's locals, is reminiscent of Stephen King but the focus on it's nerd kids screams Stephen Spielberg louder than E.T. could phone home. It's horror concept of the Upside Down parallel world and it's monsters is very H.P. Lovecraftian. And it's depiction of high school problems is very John Hughes.This is where the criticism comes in: it's very derivative and constantly points out things from the 80s that you loved, or loved to hate, to get that sense of familiarity. For instance, the second season shows the Dragons Lair Arcade game infamous for it's excruciating difficulty and Terminator running in the theaters. You constantly get that tap on the shoulder: ""hey, you liked that though back in the day, didn't you?"" But if the answer is: hell yes you bet I did"""", then there's no problem really.While it would have never been made without the inspiration of many 80s sci fi and horror classics, Stranger Things has enough strength on it's own and has proved with it's second season there's more, much more where this came from. While the first season was too reminiscent of E.T., this second season went into new and interesting directions. Can't wait till the 3rd comes!"
881,"Well, first I want to confess that I am a die hard fan of stranger things and I waited for the past 15 months for the next season. I must say that I am swayed. It was awesome. There was never a dull moment in this show, not once. It is quite an achievement for the creators for making such a show. First of all I want to mention Millie Bobby Brown, she is such a delightful actress. She has much more dialogues in this season than the former. Spoilers: She saves the day, or rather should I say saved the world. The other child actors were also very good. Dustin stole the show in case of comedy. Now the thing which I missed : 1) Eleven or el is not with Mike, Luke and Dustin for most of the season, which really bothered me. Though I guess they are going to make it up to us in the next season. El was mostly alienated from the group for the first 8 episodes. She came to Help Hawkins in the last episode, which was awesome I must admit. 2) Mike has much more screen time in this season. Comparing to the previous season in which he more or less played the lead. 3) I really didn't understand the love triangle among Luke, Dustin and Max(mad max). It seems kind of forced to include another female character. Several time was taken to make her understand the first season. Her stepbrother and her destructive relation was also created for useless suspense. Though they are great actors. Maybe they are going to play a pivotal role in season 3 and maybe they have ulterior motive. P.S. Will played by Noah Schnapp was brilliant. After being reasonably absent in the first season for most of the time. He is a lead in this one. And well he acted superbly. There was several scope for him to portray his acting, several emotions were depicted and he played the part just right."
882,"A great story, with plenty of scope going forward.The visuals, which were captivating from the beginning, have sucked me in each episode. To be honest, I wasn't sure how I would react to a show with a cast with such a varied age range. These kids steal the show, and if it weren't for their chemistry the show wouldn't be what it has become. Since watching the 2nd season I am still in awe of these kids and their abilities. They truly are exceptional. I'm still not sure which demographic this series is aimed at, but for pure nostalgia I'm loving it. The Sci-Fi aspect also a plus. What's not to love about this show? Glad to see series 3 & 4 already confirmed. Kudos to the Duffer brothers, they really know their craft!"
883,"As you read some of the negative reviews for Stranger Things, you begin to realise just how messed up modern society is when it comes to judging the quality of movies and TV.There seems to be a completely false misconception that in order for something to be good or 'original' it needs to be filled with brand new ideas that no one has ever seen (or thought of) before.Frankly, this is rubbish and the people spouting utter codswallop about it on this site clearly have way too much time on their hands or just enjoy being negative.It genuinely feels as though some people are just panning this show so they can demonstrate their knowledge of movie and TV history, mentioning a moment in the decades of movies that have gone before, where a scene was similar to one shown in Stranger Things. If that is how we judge things nowadays, it's a bit of shame.Apologies, rant over.This show is excellent. Really it is. I personally found it so engrossing that I was – for the duration of each episode – transported back in to the 80s. Credit goes to the actors - especially the kids, for making it seem so real despite having no first-hand experience on which to draw from.The way this is filmed, the lighting, the vast amount of electronic music used, the graininess in the opening credits, the cars and technology, the bicycles, the clothes and the haircuts – it's all first rate. Actually, let me just say that again. The soundtrack is awesome.As mentioned, the acting is also good. I agree with another reviewer who said that our old friend Winona Ryder wails like a slightly mentally unstable person for the majority of her time on screen but this just about bearable given the context.David Harbour is excellent as a run-down but hard-nosed local cop and all the kids are outstanding. Mathew Modine is a little under-used, but he almost feels like a last minute addition to the cast anyway so it's no real loss.The CGI and special effects are pretty solid. I think the dark settings and low lighting obviously helps. Indeed, as we get to the later episodes and the CGI becomes more important and more frequently used, you start seeing the inevitable shortcuts that were taken to support a TV series versus a blockbuster summer movie.For me the best thing about this series is the fact that it made me want to see more episodes. I found it hard to stop watching. And the interesting thing is that I couldn't quite put my finger on one single thing that made me want to watch. It really was a bit of everything.Yes, I could see where the story was heading from fairly early on, but I still wanted to see it unfold because the experience was, well, a whole lot of fun.And I guess this brings me full circle to my initial rant.There are countless references to countless 80s + 90s movies and TV series. If you're old enough, you'll spot most of them. But this didn't pose a problem for me, nor did it reduce the level of enjoyment of watching. On the contrary, it made me smile and briefly think back to my own childhood.The whole series treads a very unusual line between thriller, horror, and retro-spoof. Now, you can could say that drawing all these genres together is boring and unoriginal, but I beg to differ.Putting them all together in this way is not something I've seen before. Maybe it has been done, but I haven't seen it, and I watch plenty of series.The fact that so many people are giving this 10 stars speaks volumes, so please don't be influenced by the negative reviews without first giving at least one episode a go.This series draws you in and it's enjoyable, funny, cheesy and mildly frightening right to the very predictable ending/intro to season 2. To be fair, I'm not entirely sure how else they could've ended it.You can choose to miss it if you think everything that comes of out of Hollywood needs to be something we've never seen before – but honestly, I dare you to find a single thing on a planet of 7.6 billion people and countless series, books, movies etc. that no one has thought of or done before.Watch it. Stranger Things is fun because it's different to most of the other things out there."
884,"out of word , the story very simple, yet succeed keeping all the mystery until the end. every episodes well ended makes me want to keep continues . well written, the cast was good, and the atmosphere just brilliant , it is hard to remember this is a series because the picture is great. Lot to explore in the futureone of the best series yet ."
885,"This series was far more than I expected and delivered far more than was possible. Possible one of the best series to be launched in some time. The acting of the kids especially sort of takes you up by storm and you end up feeling an attached to them all. Can't wait for the season 2 to be launched, and for those who haven't watched. Open up netflix and start watching it as soon as possible"
886,"Stranger Things. Long story short: I loved it. I watched the first season in two days only. However, before I start watching it, I didn't know if I was going to like. I mean I didn't watch any trailer or read any review. I began without knowing what it was. I watched the first episode, and then I could not stop. The actors play very well. Moreover, I'm a big fan of David Harbour. Then, the story is perfect. In each episode, there is more suspense and we want to know what happens next. I really love the way that the series is shot. The thrill is maintained and the feelings are forwarded. So I can undoubtedly tell you that Stranger Things is one of the best TV Shows you'll ever see."
887,"This show is very exciting and interesting. In the following i try to explain why I think that. The show 'Stranger Things' is pretty new and kind off reminds of shows like X-factor etc. The show tries to create a certain 80's horror movie vibe and does it well, especially with the setting and the time it plays in. Every episode is well thought out and filmed in a way that every minute is exciting. The music and the sounds highlight certain events very well and gives the show an intense feel to it. You can always watch this show, even with your family. This show fits many personal preferences so many persons with different preferences can watch this show together. (Like in my Family) The characters also very well thought out and I always love it when when you get to like certain characters and to dislike certain characters. All in all you can say that this show is very good and exciting."
888,"Having heard great things about this show, I decided to finally watch it. I have to say that I'm super happy with my decision! It is best to go into this show not knowing too much about it.The show begins with a fantastic first episode, leaving you wanting to know more and making you wonder what the heck is actually going on. The season continues with a lot of suspense and mystery, giving off a science-fiction kind of vibe with a touch of conspiracy.Not only is the story itself super interesting but the characters are actually pretty interesting as well. This is a show where you really do care about the characters (especially the group of young cast members). I also really like the time period that the show is set in. I find it adds to the show's appeal.Overall, the first season of this show is great! Definitely worth watching! I only hope that season 2 will be just as good."
889,"There's not much one can say about this series other than that it's made for true fans of this genre. If you like the 80s, Stephen King novels, Dungeons and Dragons, are a little geeky and have a good imagination then you'll love it. A small, non-descript town is the perfect backdrop for this story. A group of adolescent boys uncover a mystery surrounding a young girl with super powers who has been part of an experiment to reach another dimension (as you do). The girl is played brilliantly by Millie Bobby Brown who has an emotional depth I've never seen in a child actor before. The story is beautifully told and is entwined with themes of friendship, the importance of family, effects of loss, a mother's love and the drive of friends to live out their fantasies and adventures together. Apparently the Duffers brothers have an affinity for Stephen King and I loved the homages to his novels throughout – I almost felt like it could have been based on one of his books. This series is like comfort food for the soul. I've watched it twice already and think I still have a third viewing in me."
890,"And the reason for a higher rating is people actually like it. It's OK for people to like something you don't even if you don't understand why. That's actually OK. The rating apparently used to be higher and would be higher than it is if it weren't for all those killjoys whingeing and whining. If it doesn't meet your high expectations don't watch it.I'm rating this 10 to bring the score back up as it rightfully deserves the high rating as one of the most unique celebrations of 80s nostalgia. So what if some people don't care for it, this isn't made for you. Sorry about that. I also enjoyed it as much, as I did Boardwalk Empire and Daredevil. Why do we watch TV shows? Because we enjoy the story. If you don't enjoy it where half to most other people do is that your fault or the creators? I'll leave readers to answer that themselves.I've been revisiting a lot of 80s movies in 2016 and someone told me about Stranger Things - I held off watching it until December and held back from binging the short series to prolong the suspense, even watching a couple of the episodes twice in a row. Far from perfect but I'm very impressed with the ambiance and vibe and pacing. What an accomplishment. So what if it has mundane parts. So what if it has filler, it's stylish. Whatever flaws are present, and I'm sure there are tons (many of which have been articulated comprehensively by indignant IMDb haters), are more or less invisible to this viewer perhaps due to an 80s bias (I grew up in the 80s being born in 1979 - etch-a-sketch, chopper bikes, Garbage Pail kids etc despite being British of course I embraced the indulgent romanticism of 80s American coming-of-age movies) HOWEVER - I'm not a great fan of 80s horror and sci fi (with a few exceptions) and I can't really stand SPIELburg's overly-sentimental and crass contributions to cinema especially ET and Close Encounters. I do respect the work of Stephen King though prefer his dramas to the horror. Despite or maybe because of all this I instantly recognised and enjoyed the parallels between this TV show and 80s titles which the creators were very deliberately and conspicuously paying homage - Stand By Me, The Goonies, Alien, Scanners, the list goes on and on (there are several blogs and entertainment sites listing the titles as well as recommendations for other post-80s films and other more recent releases). Thus the intention of this series is not to be original, as expressed in the polemic of some of the haters, but the intention is specifically NOT TO BE original. In this way the Duffer brothers have tapped into a whole generation with fond memories of retro technology and a time when such technology was in its infancy and entertainment was less cynical and the world in general seemed simpler as we were less connected and consequently more ignorant than we are post-millennium. After all ignorance is bliss.You'll notice I've not really mentioned anything about the content of the show. I'm assuming you've seen it already but if not - check it out and make your own decision. I noticed that the majority of 1 and 2 star reviews (some of them admitting that they would review it 6/10 but they deliberately rated it down to lower the mean rating - which is a cretinous thing to do) the majority of those reviewers it appears had seen the rating, or heard people saying how great it was and so then had the highest expectations - but for some reason these expectations weren't met. Personally I didn't know anything about it at all before I watched it except that it had something to do with the 80s, didn't read any reviews and wasn't aware of IMDb or any other ratings - and I enjoyed it. As a fan of comedy and fantasy but not so much of scifi horror, this show perfectly filtered and watered down vintage horror and added a watertight cast, 80s kids movies nostalgia and topped it off with a lovely ambient synth soundtrack.So this review is for the haters. This show is not perfect but it is entirely comprised of elements that some audiences, myself included, have wanted to see for a very long time. Keep on hating, I'm waiting keenly for season 2 and if it disappoints, so what? It's not even that important! The important thing is that for whatever reasons for the Duffer Brothers, whether they wrote it or not (whereby as they didn't write it according to IMDb reviewer bradcheng; ""their auteur status goes down the drain""), this is a labour of love - demonstrated by it being rejected fifteen times before Netflix - and their love for the material shows in the work, whether it makes sense to some viewers or not, if viewers have the imagination to enact, in the words of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, willing suspension of disbelief (a term which was coined in the discussion of texts like this, involving the supernatural). Like Peter Jackson the Duffers are unabashedly invested in their subject matter and though might not be pioneers of horror/fantasy/scifi they worked hard to realise their vision regardless of whether audiences think they were successful or not. Some audiences like these works - some don't. if you don't, I'm sorry for you, that you don't get it, that you didn't enjoy it. At he end of the day this TV show will quickly and quite rightfully become an instant cult classic, in the words of another historical Englishman ""warts and all""."
891,"What's inside of a secret government lab located in Hawkins, Indiana may hold something far beyond comprehension. Consisting of a portal to a parallel world and a carnivorous demogorgon prowling for the next victim. ""Stranger things""-a sci-fi thriller, is about a young boy named Will that goes missing one night, and the courageous and adrenaline filled acts that are done to find him. The lead cast is fabulous and plays their part perfectly. I've personally never been a fan of sci-fi shows or movies, but ""stranger things"" has me hooked The idea of multiple dimensions and aliens has always intrigued me. Some people think the show is ""too slow."" The fact the writers could put a whole story consisting of as many things as it does, into an 8 episode season is really impressive and proves each and every episode is packed to a max with content you're looking for. The second complaint was ""the aliens and super human abilities are too much."" If you like sci-fi alien movies/miniseries that are: super good,suspenseful, and keeps you on your toes, then this is the one for you."
892,"I cannot express how dam good this show is so I'm going to be very informal.At the beginning of the summer this year, my Facebook updates were jammed with constant articles and posts about the mysterious new show Stranger Things on Netflix. I at that point had not much interest, and now I want to beat myself up for that. Then just last Thursday I started o episode 1 of this so called ""Stranger Things"" and immediately as soon as it finished I was having leg cramps of excitement (seriously I did get leg cramps).Stranger Things follows the community of the town of Hawkins, who come together when a young boy Will Byers sinisterly disappears. While the local police carry out their investigation, paranormal and supernatural occurrences begin to haunt the town. We follow the adventures of: the three best fiends of the missing boy as they try to look for their lost pal, the brilliant performed hysterical mother by Winona Ryder, the curious girl who more than meets the eye, and the typical high school sub storyline, which is interesting than first considered.Created by the Duffer Brothers Stranger Things pulls together all 80s nostalgia and classic cinematic adventures such as Goonies, ET, Steven Spielberg, and Stephen King. You fell very familiar with what you see, but by the end you will be so mind blown from what you just witnessed. A very easy to watch show consisting of 8 episodes of 50 minutes, makes Stranger Things the most binge watchable show ever. Just an afternoon's work.The show is very creepy mostly ( the score is out of the is world literally), but has its sweet, funny moments as well, so has something for everyone. It has sub genre as a horror but not conventional sense.This is seriously a show worth watching, even if this is the one show you watch its definitely worth paying for. Stranger Things is a fantastic, traditional and original piece of perfect television ( the best out of the whole year I'd say). A must watch 10/10 OBVIOUSLY!"
893,"The show Stranger Things has many, many electric and suspenseful moments. Some of the moments when the electricity starts going crazy is when the demogorgon comes around. Also, the demogorgon comes around when it's triggered blood. For example when Eleven killed her Papa and his workers, there was a lot of blood so it triggered the demogorgon. Another example when the electricity was going crazy was when Will was communicating with his mother through the lights in his house. Some energy moments that happened in this show was when Barb was sitting at the pool alone waiting for Nancy. Barb was bleeding so that triggered the demogorgon. We didn't know what happened to Barb. Was she alive? or was she dead? Another suspenseful moment was when Will fell off his bike and ran into his shed, and the lights flickered and then he disappeared. Was he okay? Who or What took him?"
894,As i watched stranger things i would say this series was excellent and had very good suspenseful Moments. While watching the show i noticed that every time Will tried to contact his mother or either his friends it was done using electricity. Electricity played a big role in this cause in the series Will was basically trapped in an underworld that was considered different from our world everything was much more darker compared. They also made friends with with a girl named Eleven whose named was shortened to El. In the show she was a test subject in a psychiatric ward by her farther. She met Mike they started too fall for each other but she also ended up helping him and his friends get back into contact with will.In one part of the show it shows the viewer how these people are brought into the underworld it is also well enough explained how one must get there by creating just enough electricity that nobody not even humans could possibly make.Believe it or not this all started over a game involving a demogorgon .Overall i feel like this series is good for any mystery and suspense class its fun and addictive.
895,"I agree that viewers can fill in some details, but there are so many logical flaws in this show which contradicts with itself. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the show is bad. Actually I pretty enjoy the show, the costumes and scenes are pretty real. The actors are acting well, especially for those kids. However one of joys I have during the time watching the show is to see how many logical flaws it has. Here is some I can remember now: 1. Why did they (lab guys) kill the big cook but not sheriff? The big cook (at beginning) just met a lost girl and report to government. They can simply pretend as government employee (they do have the power to do it) who are supposed to take care of lost kids and pick the girl up. It's definitely not necessary to kill a guy. OK, we can just accept this as an assumption in the show: they are evil guys. Their working style is killing people to cover up the truth to make 100% sure for their secrets. Then why they didn't kill the sheriff? He definitely knows much more secret since he has already got into the lab and seen a lot of secrets. Is it just because he is one of the main characters? 2. Why did the lab guys want to make a fake body of lost kid? First of all, why did they think the lost boy had any relations with their lab or secret. The boy was caught by the monster, the lab guys should not even know it. During that time, they didn't even know much about the monster or if it has offensive action. (They sent a single guy without power weapon or good supports later and didn't expect the death of that man.) OK, we can accept that they are too nervous and believe the lost boy is caused by their secret project. Then if they really want to cover up their secret, they need to let as less people involved as possible and treat that accident as a normal lost kid case (Sending some Amber Alert on highway or similar...). Then after several months, no one except the parents would care about it. However what they did was calling up tens of cops and several ambulance to perform a big show (for whom?), making a big news to let everyone in the world knows the accident, and then they made a fake body by some kind of silicon skin with cotton stuffing... Are you serious? 3. How did Will contact with his mother? It seems that several assumptions had made for this: (a) The upside down world has exact same objects as the real world (street, house...); (b) People in the upside down world can hear the sound from real world, but cannot see anything in the real world (people, fire...) (c) When people in the upside down world getting close to light bubble, the bubble in real world will on. However how did Will figure that he can light on the bubbles in the real world? He cannot see anything happened in the real world. Then how could he know to light the bubble on by going close to it? Alright, we can assumption Will is a really really smart and brave boy and he was staying home all the time and listening to his mother's response to the light and eventually figured out this mechanism. Then how did he send words to his mother? I mean when his mother paints the characters on the wall, can Will see the same character at the same position in the upside down world? Can Will see the same light bubble there too? （I didn't see them at the upside down scene.) If yes, did he see some bubbles flying in the air when his mother setting these bubbles? Did he see the door opening and closing by itself when his brother getting in and out the house at real world? Why they cannot see something like fire, bat or all these stuffs when sheriff and Will's mother came to his house? What will it response in the real world if they damage something in the upside down world? All these basic assumptions about environmental correlation between two worlds are full of flaws. It seems they made assumption at first and then twisted it whenever the story needs. There are still a lot flaws I didn't mention. Such as: 4. How did the monster travel between two worlds (Need the gate or not)? 5. How could sheriff get into the big lab building for the first time without any preparation or guide then directly get to the most inner and secret room? (The building was full of camera and guards). 6. If three teenagers with only a small gun, a trap, gas fire can stop and beat the monster away, why not tens of trained guys with machine guns cannot do the same thing? What's more ironically, even 3 kids with a small slingshot can slow down the monster. 7. If the monster is sensitive to blood, the first thing it would get probably is the fresh meet in kitchen, right? (Now I'm kidding :) )"
896,"I had heard a lot of praise for this show, but I wasn't all that interested, at first. I knew it was, basically, a love letter to classic Spielberg and Stephen King, both of whom I am a very big fan, but I had seen J.J. Abrams' Super 8, and, while it was good, I felt it was a bit lacking in the magic that Spielberg and King had always perfected. Not the case with this show.One night I just decided to start it, because I was looking for a good 80s movie to watch. Very first shot, with the guy in the lab coat, running away, I was instantly engaged, wanting to know what was happening. In my opinion, the girl, named Eleven, steals the show, even from well-known actors like Winona Ryder, David Harbour, and Matthew Modine. The three main protagonists, the boys, are a close second. These four kids are just amazing and have really good acting chops. Many plot points are taken from classic 80s movies, with a lot of throwbacks to Alien, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. and countless others. There are people disappearing in a small rural town in the 80s and there are some ""strange things"" happening. The suspense, the mystery, the horror, the emotion, are all spectacular and it's all set against a perfectly realized 1980s backdrop. I can't wait for season 2!"
897,"I didn't believe the hype when this show first hit Netflix. Everyone was talking about it and I figured it was just some stupid show. I was completely wrong. I just non-stop watched the whole first season and it blew me away. It literally is as far up my alley as something can be. It's got an 80's setting complete with synthesizers and a slight film grain, thriller drama elements, super powers, monsters, an alternate reality, top notch acting, an excellent score with the appropriate 80's soundtrack and an insanely good gripping story. I enjoyed this show so much and I encourage anyone who enjoys being entertained to watch this show. After finishing it I feel weird and attached to the characters in a way that only the best movie and TV shows can do to you and I can not wait until season 2. The Duffer brothers have an enormous and well deserved success to follow up and hopefully they can pull it off."
898,"I admit that When you watch the first episode, it makes want to watch them all. At the end, you wont waste your time, but you want get some masterpiece of a show that you may be searching for. The casting is very good. I also liked the whole 80s atmosphere that creators want to get. It has perfect soundtrack, something that makes the show more likable. But nevertheless, at the end of it all you get the feeling like it is ""Steven King wanna be"" movie or ""Twin Peaks for kids"" or ""Darker version of E.T"". While you watch it, it brings nostalgia for all that 80s movies. And the creators get that feeling very good. You kinda think that it was really shoot at the 80s. Not the best show on earth, but worth watching. Seven from ten from me."
899,"Love this show. The acting, character development, setting, characters, tone, and writing are fantastic. The dynamics between the characters are sweet and interesting. I'm glad to finally have an intense and clean show to watch. The music and sound add to the mystique and horror. I really hope they do more seasons. My husband even loved it and misses watching it, which says a lot because not many shows hold his interest. He can usually figure out shows too soon or find all of the holes in the plot, but he was very impressed with this series. Again, I really hope they continue this series on Netflix and maybe make some more quality shows like this one. Love the 80's nostalgia."
900,"You must be out of your mind to miss this.If you grew in the 80's then this brings you back to those cool times playing with your mates, building dens and just being out doors. No phones no internet. Really listening to music.To those of you who missed the 80's this says it all. Obviously our monsters weren't as real.The feel of this series is great, brilliant story lines keeping you hooked at every corner. Perfectly cast.I've just watched episode 7 and not once through the series so far have I reached to check my phone to look at crap I don't really need.Oh how I wish I was back in the 80's. We had style.Love little mum dent"
901,I never write reviews here.But this show deserves one!It is great to see something that is being produced today that gives you that real feeling that you had when you watched movies in the 80's or 90's. No filters no extreme computer animation just this raw movie feeling. I always like to compare this to the first Die Hard movies. Because they gave me this feeling to.The show itself is amazing good acting and a truly great story. An absolute must for everyone that likes mystery and Syfy.I hope that more movies and series in the future go back to this old school style / technique.
902,"In India, Netflix isn't a phenomenon that people would have easy access to and we only hear of good shows either by word of mouth or social media. Thanks to FB for propagating heavily on 'Stranger Things'. Read few lines about the show and browsed through IMDb to know all that could feed my interest. Finally started watching it online couple of days back and already started with the fifth episode. Honestly, I never thought there could be a show to hook me like TWD did. From the performances, to actors and the whole environment of the show is what you need after very decade or two to take you back to the good old days of fantastical childhood. As much as it has been said, the show kept reminding me of Goonies and ET and Super 8 and Stephen King and Steven Spielberg and blah blah. I can only thank Duffer Brothers for not being shortlisted to direct the new 'IT' film or this jewel of a show would have taken more time to come to us. It has a sense of sweetness, calmness and dread and thrill at the same time. There is something about 80s that never gets old and looks even better on screen. After I am finished watching it, I am definitely doing a marathon of it for Halloween with dim lights and my pumpkin pie.For those who are still contemplating about it, just don't wait and try watching the first episode. I promise, you would be glued to it like I am and many others."
903,"I found that I didn't really enjoy this series as much as I was hoping to.It was obvious the creators had put a LOT of thought into the entire thing, it really shows, but if their intention was to create a show aside from the whole '80s thing, a lot of the effort was misplaced.While it does do a great job of being an '80s homage, if that's not something you're already excited by, this show may be a little disappointing. While interesting to see an '80s world on TV ~30 years after the '80s, if you don't really care about the '80s that much or have a heap of nostalgia for it, it may feel like the show is dragging on a little. I will say that this eases up after the first 2-3 episodes, and a lot of this could be regarded as ""World building"" or ""Setting up the plot"", but a lot of it DOESN'T contribute to the plot, and as such, it feels like there's someone following you around saying ""... hey.... guess what..... this show's set in the '80s."" in literally every moment of every scene. While I enjoyed the final 2 episodes very much, I feel like the things that occurred in the plot would have had just as much impact with about half of the build up... in about every story line that was followed. I also feel like it would have played into the whole '80s homage a lot more if there was much more ""Spielberg Kiddie Flick"" action outside the final 2 episodes as well. One thing I will commend the writers on is the characters themselves. Unlike the plot, the balance between character and '80s trope has a really good balance, with the joys of modern standards written in really well. No character is overly stupid or overly smart, they're all stereotypes of another era, but they very rarely actually feel cliché or annoying. Props to them for that! Probably one of my favourite viewings in regards to characters.In the end, I did enjoy it, but with much of the plot ignored for nostalgia-tugging, I don't feel this is as much of a watch as others are saying it is."
904,"This show got me hooked right from the get go and after binge watching it and the re watching it again it still is an amazing programme.The story-line this show has is probably one of the best ones at the moment as it makes sense and isn't confusing to watch, I haven't seen a show that has gripped me as much as this one did so quickly and that it didn't take forever to get an answer as well made this show perfect for me to watch. The way this show has been made and the effects and visuals honestly were amazing to watch each and every episode, the art work in this was amazing. I honestly hope they are making another series of this as I love every second of it."
905,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****Review made most out of episode 1.So. After about 2 years of conveying from a friend of mine (you know who you are) I finally got the interest up for watching a series. I turned it on. If you like me were around 10 years of age you certainly will see and experience things (stranger things? pun? Yeah!) in this one. After just a couple of minutes I recognize so much that I just were astonished. - The opening scene; the font as taken from McGyver or something. Spot on! - A doctor escapes a laboratory... a lethal hunt. - A gang of teenagers (see Goonies, E.T. and Stand By Me) in a role playing game. Dungeons and Dragons... here I come! - On the wall besides the game: a poster of the movie ""The Thing"" with Kurt Russell. (In episode 2; watch the wall as the guys is listening to Clash; there, the poster of Evil Dead!) - They all ride bikes with big light bulbs... hilarious! (Back to Goonies...?) I even got a bike with a long seat like the one in here. And... Ralph Macchio in ""The Karate Kid"" - A boy running away into the woods from some kind of monster. Cut to forest with a lot of...yes, that is correct; fog, fog and fog. Brings back memories from the horror movies in the eighties. - The music as the kids leaves on bikes brings memories back from the music era... and also into the game of ""The Last Ninja"" (first stage ""Into the Wilderness""... just listen on the synthesizers! Marvellous!) - A desperate and ""horrorfying"" situation with a phone... of course occupied on the other line and... yes.... dropping the old phone just hanging by the thread. All above in the first episode before the proper introduction come in play. - The introduction with the red neon lights and the music pushing the cast forward... wow... put me right into the movie of Manhunter and a nod to Michael Mann! - A strong ""filmatic and movie-ish"" strobe effect on the entire production and editing! Oh... give me back my child heroes! The Goonies... Sloth....were are you!? - My first big laugh: about 13 minutes into Stranger Things, episode 1. In the movie ""The Goonies"", there is Chunk. He has to do the dance before being let inside the house. Everybody is laughing. Here, the guy in the hat does the ""arm thing"", as a nod to Chunk! The character of Mike... like ""Hey, Mikey!"" in The Goonies! Excellent! - Oh...28 minutes into episode 1: ""Tickets to Poltergeist!"" Bazinga! Oh...sorry, I meant bullseye! - In The Goonies, when they find One Eyed Willy; the music is played out gently. Listen to that and listen to the keyboard sounds at 40:35 in episode 1. - Being personal here; I am a huge (and 62 exclamation marks) fan of the global phenomenon of the epic rock group TOTO (that also made Michael Jacksons ""Thriller"" around 1983, as for the year of ""Stranger Things""). And... voilá! 42 minutes into episode 1: ""It's gonna take some time to do the things we never had"". Magic... true magic! Like David Copperfield from 1983 touched the production there! Time: 42 minutes and 59 seconds; ""You're beautiful, Nancy Wheeler!"" and right into ""It's gonna take a lot to drag me away from you..."" Then ""I bless the rains down in Africa..."", and cut to the rain outside of the house! Goosebumps, clap, clap, clap...goosebumps, clap, clap, clap! Wonderful screenplay, epic screen writing and a really fine moment of movie magic! - Episode 4; bad place... Sweden...sub zero! Laughed so hard!Keep your eyes open for references... Moments of Twin Peaks and Halloween. I am back into the eighties! Thank You, Matt and Ross Duffer!Over to the series as a product: - The production : Let me use an over used word: awesome! The music, the soundtrack, the sound effects, the camera angles, the costumes and clothes, the environment, the surroundings, the bicycles, the language, the phrases and slang... properly in place and genius! Hats off to this one! The title ""Stranger Things""... a better and more suited title would have made the production more rounded up. - The actors : Winona Ryder; question mark? Well... why Winona? I had preferred some other more intense and in depth actress. The rest of the cast is all in place, is delivering and that in a nice and great way. They all got their clear parts, and they sell it to the crowd and viewers. David Harbour is grasping the role perfectly; a tormented father that lost his daughter and now is the head of the town police. Slow and heavy, produced a solid character there, David Harbour! Matthew Modine evolves in the character and creates a both mysterious and dangerous role. - Entertainment : Starts off in a slow pace... mysterious...fiction...horror... nostalgia... and... boom! You are right in the middle of the story. Excellent entertainment. - Age : 11 or 15, depends of the company and the maturity of the individual.8,6 out of 10."
906,"This show is one of the best shows of 2016. The 1980s time period was captured quite well. The town, the clothes, the hair styles stayed very true to the period. At first I didn't know if Wynona Ryder was going to be good in this kind of role, she did fantastic. It's in the vein of movies like The Goonies or Monster Squad or Lean on me were the children play an important part of driving the story. By the end of the season as you finish the last episode you will be sad that you will have to wait to see the next chapter in the series. The Netflix all episodes available at once model makes this a buffet your upset when it closes."
907,"If your not a Netflix subscriber you've probably never heard of this show, but from what I can see it's getting advertised quite well, so I could be wrong. ""Stranger Things"" is an 80's style sci-fi/horror type of drama, as of today there are eight episodes so far. Winona Ryder is an excellent choice for a pivotal role in this saga. She is a tour de force, watching her on screen brings smiles to my face because she really hasn't been in anything remotely good for a really long time. The series really has a mixture of everything that was cool back in the early 80's it was like I was watching this through the eyes of a 10 year old boy with wonder and amazement. We are introduced to many characters, with roles similar to either ""The Goonies"" or ""Stand By Me"" There are also hints of the film ""Firestarter"" as well. I really don't want to give too much away. So I won't make this a spoiler review. Just a generalization. Every episode seems to have a theme, but sticks to the basic underlying plot and some great tunes from the 80's to go along with it. With the likes of the late David Bowie and so forth. There is also some elements of the X-Files from time to time, but it's not very pronounced and in your face, just a very subtle feeling from that show, even though it was based in the 90's, it still has that feel. It was nice seeing Matthew Modine in this show as well, I haven't seen him in so long I could hardly recognize him. Unknown to me Charlie Heaton plays a really strong role as well, he has a lot of talent. The three main child actors Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin, Gaten Matarazzo bring to their roles such passion they make you feel like a kid again.""Stranger Things"" is a well rounded show, that has allowed forgotten actors from the past to breath new life into television again, with so many shows based on Zombies and Reality, it's nice to sink your teeth into something fun and mysterious such as this show. ""Stranger Things"" could go anywhere, and do anything the gates are wide open, and it's just amazing the talented writers in this world can still master the marvel of cinematography. I recommend this show to anyone above the age of ten. Some kids might find some scenes frightening, but all in all a definite winner."
908,"Noir 80's feel for the whole series combined with some amazing storytelling and script. Great acting, directing and some pretty cool set pieces.The atmosphere was there, and it seems that all the actors actually enjoyed taking part which made the whole series flow much better.The best way to describe it without ruining anything for those that haven't seen it is.. Well, throw in a bit of old school 80's horror, add a dash of Alien with a sprinkling of Nightmare on Elm Street. Stir in bit of poltergeist and lightly finish off with a touch of The Goonies. It's one of those gems of a series that you will enjoy.. Heck, even my mother who's in her late 60s loved it.My only complaint? It could have easily been fleshed out to more episodes and more time spent on the missing boy (those who have seen it will know what I mean) and for that reason only, it loses a point. Otherwise a sure fire 10/10.Even so, Everyone who took part should be proud and take a deserved bow.Here's hoping for season 2..."
909,"This show is really addictive. Once I started watching, I just couldn't stop! The cast is just amazing. The way the kids bond, their crazy comments (especially Dustin's) are so hilarious! Everything lovable in good movies seem to be in the show. It makes you feel like you're part of the story, like you're pulled in to that small strange town, observing from its other dimension. If you're a big fan of Spielberg's and King's stories and their wonderful way of telling stories, you're in for a treat. There are only eight episodes. So, it's easy to just gulp down the entire season one in one night -- which I did. I can't wait for season two to see how the unresolved problem will develop and how the characters will cope with it this time."
910,"This has been described as a ""love letter to '80's cinema"", with its cheesy gooey monsters and boundary-crossing research on humans that drive the plot. I don't watch this genre, but fell in love with Stranger Things. There's the main plot of trying to find a lost boy, and then the plots and relationships that develop around it - a group of kids that form their own search party to look for their friend, and their relationship with another kid who is running from mysterious bad guys and whom they enlist to help them. I love this show for the epic monster-battles and the loyalty that the kids have for each other. It's one of those things where they have their own little world, separate from the adults, and is the cutest thing to watch.*Possible spoiler* The solitary reason I gave it 9 stars instead of 10 is that the friendships take a predictable turn in one way. Nevertheless, I give it major points for not being afraid to make their bond more complicated than being perfect all the time, which makes it realistic and all the sweeter for it. Absolutely fantastic."
911,"It reminded me of my childhood!I was excepting it for a long time since i heard of it!! It was more than I expected! All my best movies in one, combining mystery, fantasy ,weird humour and great music!!! Perfect scenery, great cast, i am so happy to see Winona Ryder!! The atmosphere gets you so much in the eighties mood that we love so much!! I hope more series like that will come!!I already put it first on my list with my favorites !! I definitely would suggested to everyone seeing it! It leaves you with some questions that makes you wonder.. May be a season two will come.."
912,"Just finished this. This has been one of the most amazing things I have ever had the pleasure of watching. The cast,the score,the direction....everything is literally perfect! I found myself creeped out/intrigued/heartfelt/amused.....just absolutely absorbed and invested in every single word spoken and scene shot. Aside all of this,its set authentically in the 80s where kids on bikes are the heroes (Think E.T/Goonies etc). The character dynamics across the board were faultless and having Mobys 'When its cold Id like to die' in the final moments (A hugely sentimental piece of music to me anyway) was just genius and don't think any other moment of anything else could warrant using it. Bravo to the Duffer brothers for an absolute masterpiece from start to finish. I don't impress easy but this is a straight up 10/10 without hesitation"
913,"I read an interview with the kids in this show in which they called it a period piece. Calling Stranger Things a period piece is an oversimplification. No, this show is an honest to goodness time machine. It may as well have been made in the 80's. Sure, there are some modern special effects, but they are modest, and not really distracting from the feeling that you really are back in the 80's while watching this show. The music. OH the music. That deep synthesizer reminiscent of so many classic Sci-Fi and Horror movies of the time. From the PERFECTLY done opening titles, to the sparse but immensely timed score, it sets the tone, and prepares you for something great. That said, the acting is what makes this show something truly special. It took me at least 10 minutes of screen time to realize I was watching Wynona Ryder. To a one, the cast is phenomenal. Finn Wolfhard (the most awesome name ever) as Michael is the second coming of Henry Thomas' Elliot in E.T. The kid is awesome, but there's no way, at that age, that he could be such a perfect analogue for Elliot. That's great casting, an adult who saw a you be actor who was just like Henry Thomas at that age. Toothless is SO the ""Wolfman gots nards"" kid from Monster Squad, and he kills it. El...Millie Brown Bobby is the next great thing. She communicates so much with just her facial expressions, you just want to love her before she even says a word. Stranger Things is also mature, thoughtful, and sometimes terrifying. It spends ample time on its characters, and it makes their lives relate-able in that way we never want to relate. Kudos to Netflix, once again, for taking a shot at an underdog and coming out a Champ."
914,"Netflix has commissioned some great shows of late, Making a Murderer, Better Call Saul, Narcos, Bloodline and now Stranger Things. When you see the trailer you think, OK a homage to the 80's but so what... Well I've not seen a series of it's genre that not only shocks, scares and thrills but actually builds likable yet flawed characters through great writing, directing and acting (and very well edited of course). The main stars of the show are the children who are natural, funny and utterly believable. Think Pans Labyrinth meets a Spielberg film but darker and better! Give it a go."
915,"The Duffer Brothers have nailed everything from the location and soundtrack to the cast with David Harbour fronting the way. Together combined to make a excellent 80s nostalgia experience without ever trying to force it. My best way to describe it would be you could throw it in the mix of some of the best back then and you wouldn't even noticed it was produced nearly 40 years later.The story has you hooked straight away and hits all the right buttons to create just a right amount of suspense, joy and maybe a few tears.I for one have been crying out for a series like this to come about so I am really looking forward to see where it goes next."
916,"Netflixes original content of late I've personally found a little disappointing so was a little dubious about this series and wasn't really planning on watching it anytime soon, but yesterday couldn't find anything to watch so decided to give it a try with my expectations a little low,. After the first 20 minutes I was hooked and done something I rarely do and binged my way through the whole series.It's not without its flaws, the characters from the government provably the biggest as they all seem very flat and under developed, CGI is a little ropey at times and a few actors on occasion go a little soapy with their acting. But all of this can be forgiven for how genuinely brilliant the show is. It's taken everything what was wonderful about 80's family adventure flicks and rolled it into one.Winona Ryder, Natalia Dyer and all the child actors for me steal the whole show, the soundtrack and score were top notch, but what really impressed me was through all 8 episodes there was no filler scenes every single minute of the show added to the story or character development. Truly top notch and if it doesn't go on to win awards it would be a travesty."
917,"THIS SHOW IS AMAZING. There are so many amazing actors and actresses which all deliver Oscar worthy performances, combining that with the mind-blowing plot the writers have given us this is a must see. The characters are believable, and grounded in reality and yet when something Supernatural happens, they try to solve the mystery but the actors do it in such a way that you BELIEVE that this could be really happening. I really liked how they just tease you with the small bits and then at the end they just go and give you everything they have, which was just amazing.They made some very good casting choices and the kid actors were surprisingly possibly the best part of this."
918,"The cast? Amazing! Every single actor seem to be perfect in his/her role...you start wondering, are they acting or they really live it? The kids are all great in their acting with the leading girl being breathtaking. She expresses all kind of emotions without to even talk.The director did excellent job, everything is balanced, nothing is out of proportion, every scene is giving you all range of feelings and makes you attached to the characters.The story is simple and yet complicated, sci-fi and yet is touching every day human problems and behaviors....I just love it...I wish there is a second season!"
919,"Oh boy!!! What can I possibly say about this fantastic show that no one else already has. Murder, mystery, suspense, thriller, horror, comedy, action, drama, sci-fi etc all beautifully wrapped up in a perfect 80's theme. It is Christmas come early on Netflix with this show. Every character in this show is spot on, and the kids especially are fabulous. They are the real stars in the show, and the way they are portrayed epitomises everything that was brilliant about the 80's.You will want to root for them till the very end as they bring out the kid in you as well. The dialogues are really good and the suspense keeps you at the edge of your seats. I absolutely adore the theme music and the musical score throughout the show is spot on as well. This show is a must watch for absolutely everyone of all tastes, and it really deserves all the praise. Spread the word that stranger things are definitely happening."
920,My first review you all. I promise I will get better. Stranger Things first season 8 episodes of pure dream like bliss. A series that deserves its high ratings. It brings back so many memories of similar contented movies from the past but still has you guessing. Netflix is producing some talented shows. The duffer brothers have some serious skills. The setting is perfect and all the cast play out well. I could only fault the series once as like all shows its not perfect but I do believe that's how movie and TV shows of the Eighties rolled. I could give you a list of movies that this show reminds me of. I think in all honesty if you have read a Steven King Novel or especially a Dean Koontz novel you will drift of in a dream like state and be hooked from the first episode. The only time you will be disappointed is when the end credits role at Episode 8 because you will be wanting more. The sights and sounds of a time past come back to life. Enjoy.
921,"this is the best TV Series I ever watched. It gives you many feelings and I can't really explain in letters what feelings I got with the character eleven and the other 3 boys, my favorite is the toothless kid he's pretty smart and he's swearing really gives a funny yet perfect character to him and yes in the story it's in the 90's which my favorite part because everyone likes old school right? and how they used the 90's songs in the story really matches and gives a perfectness and much more I can't explain it in letters so you better just watch this :) and best part about movies and these kind of TV series is that it's fun because you can get feelings that you can't actually get usually. and it's like FightClub LetMeIn those kind of old movies gave me emotion and feelings and made me think and gave me many feelings. sorry for the many ""feeling"" sentence but you might understand me once you watch this TV series.-should I stay or should I go~ :)"
922,"More than Spielberg, this show is closer to earlier Stephen King (""the Body"" and ""It"", to name but a few), in style and in spirit.Strange things are happening in the small town of Hawkins, Indiana. When a young boy disappears, a group of misfits, of young kids and teenagers, together with a paranoid mother and a Sheriff with a traumatic past, stumbled upon a government conspiracy involving psychic manipulation and experimental parallel worlds. And in the process of rescuing the vanished kid, sanity will be questioned, friendship tested, teenage angst overcame. In other words, all the elements of a 80s genre masterpiece were safely in place. Simple but likable.The sets and production design very accurately recreate the air of the 80s classics which the series clearly draw its inspiration from. Special mention must be made to the acting. Nostalgic without overly clichéd, the characters were all very well-written and portrayed, true to their 80s inspirations in an innocently unpretentious manner. Unlike other genre efforts to ride the nostalgia bandwagon which most often ending up parodying their sources, this series treats its inspirations as genuine and organic, rather than just a phony commemorative exercise. After a promising start, the story came to a satisfying conclusion after a 8-episodes season. As a standalone season with just a few loose ends to be tied up, this is an overall quality, sometimes amazing show which deserves to be seen and appreciated by the general audience."
923,"Absolutely fantastic! Brilliant cast. The young child actors all deserve huge praise. One maybe a little more in Millie Brown. This is a talent you don't see often. Flawless would be an understatement. Winona Ryder shows her acting chops have only gotten better with age. Amen to the Duffer Brothers. The directing , writing, music and cinematography are all on the money. This show relates to all ages which is pretty rare to find these days. Stranger Things provides you with just enough laughter yet pulses on the horror/drama aspect to perfection. Now this is a way to bring back the 80s. Anybody who likes good television don't hesitate to order Netflix immediately. Besides you're already missing out on House of Cards & Bloodline. Z"
924,"Stranger Things is really very good, captures all the magic of the 80s and all the nostalgy, but missing something crucial, the music. The music of the 80s, A-ha, Mr. Mister, Cindy Looper, White Snake or something like that, at a certain time only is heard ""Africa"" and the series really came alive in the 80s. The series needs more music known of the 80s, just for this is not excellent.

The series needs more music known of the 80s, just for this is not excellent."
925,"This review is of season one. No spoilers. ""Stranger Things"" doesn't only feel like a Stephen King story, it feels like a collage of them. If you're familiar with King's classic books and stories, you will recognize many things and feel right at home. It's like a homage from people who KNOW what makes those stories and characters tick. The resemblance is uncanny, and that's probably why the man is referenced in the show a couple of times. I want to add that this doesn't feel like watching an average Stephen King adaptation, but more like reading an above-average story of his. That is a plus. While I focus mostly on King in this review, ""Stranger Things"" is full of references from E.T. to some more modern stuff as well, often to a point where you feel bombarded with it, if you're very familiar with a few decades of pop-culture. It won't bother young people that much, but the older you are the more you see it. The sheer volume and unabashed use of these elements can be distracting at times, and at no point is this series original.That said, ""Stranger Things"" manages to be quite good. This is a fairly simple show with a lot of effective storytelling to make it more engaging than most supernatural horror shows. Time is not wasted on filler, so if you think you're watching filler, you're likely to be surprised soon after. There's a lot of setup and payoff, lots of simple metaphors, lots of exposition that's written well into the story.The pacing is to be complimented too, because the story never stops and you aren't forced to care about trivial happenings, trivial people or their relationships. The writing/directing is often spot on concerning this. If the story makes you suddenly intrigued about something, that's exactly what you'll get, not endless hours of dancing around it.Many things, including several characters, are very simplistic - almost in a way that many people would call dumb - but I mean this in the best possible way. I loved the simple nature of things: if a character looks like a douche, it's a bad guy. Sometimes your sympathies shift, as if to make characters seem more deep, but it's just simple manipulation. That's it, no forced subtlety. Things are charmingly blunt, and it works to the show's advantage. The actors and characters deserve some praise. Either they're straight up good, and if sometimes they're not, they're still entertaining. David Harbour is charismatic and pleasing to watch whenever on screen, and Winona Ryder's got a somewhat entertaining nerve-wreck of a character to play, even though her performance sometimes annoyed me a little. But none of this could work without Millie Bobby Brown, who does a good job. Child actors usually make me cringe and take me out of whatever I'm watching, but she handled her role very well with a certain sense of powerful restraint. Her character, ""Eleven"", is the dramatic heart of the series, which makes her performance that much more important. Most of the time I could enjoy the other child actors too, and the trio consisting of Wolfhard-Matarazzo-McLaughlin made me often think of ""Stand By Me"" or ""IT"", that certain way how Stephen King writes his child characters and their friendships.Where ""Stranger Things"" fails is in some of the special effects and the lack of original, beating heart. I know this is a TV show with a budget. That is why I can't fathom why they chose CGI so often instead of practical effects. Because when it's practical, it's quite good, charming and interesting. When it's not, it takes you out of the moment. In the '80s (which is the time period for the series as well), the rule of ""not showing too much"" wasn't just because of building suspense, but also because what they had to show was often horrible, so they had to be creative with several methods. And this is where it becomes more baffling: there are instances in this show where the effects are very, very good. There is a certain thing they do with lighting, water and a weird contrast where everything is black instead of where the light is. CGI was only used to slightly enhance the effect, it wasn't the effect itself. It looked amazing, and it worked storytelling-wise (although I hear these visuals are ripped off from ""Under the Skin""). You could put that into a 200-million dollar X-men movie any day. So more of this, and less of ""CGI creature moving into a flat shot"".The lack of originality can shine through at times, be it story elements or visual shots imitating someone else's work. Even if the story was pretty good, at times I felt like I was watching well-made fan fiction and it took me out of the experience. You either embrace it, endure it or hate it. My feelings shifted between like and endure, but I can't blame anyone for hating it either. In the end, I liked ""Stranger Things"" a lot more than I thought I would. It's great escapism and while it's quite simple and blunt in the end, it does what many shows don't: It cuts to the chase, doesn't dance around the subject, doesn't treat its audience like idiots and it boasts a variety of effective methods to tell a story. No artificial prolonging (at least yet), no filler, no nonsense. Recommended not only for fans of throwbacks and Stephen King's classic stories, but for everyone bored of shows that don't know how to handle their material.edit: I've been hearing that season two will be about the same characters, and about continuing the same story. It certainly seems like another case of not knowing when to quit. It's a plague that's killed many stories, series and franchises. ""Stranger Things"" season one is good, but I'm very cynical about season two."
926,"I just finished watching ""Stranger Things"" on a two-day binge. I know, not hard for a series only 8 hours long... but who cares, right? I binge watched it. That meant it was good enough to keep my interest. If it weren't for needing to be up early this morning, I'd have finished it in ONE day.I noticed several negative reviews - on Netflix and on the web in general.Yes, this movie has a whole lot of familiar tropes in it. YES, it hearkens back to the days where everyone knew what ""The Shop"" was. It calls to mind everything from ""E.T. The Extra Terrestrial"", to ""It"", and even - in my eyes - to ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". And - no - this isn't an alien movie. Not by my book, anyway. This is an all out thrill ride of fun-loving tropes that call us back to the days of slightly more wholesome but still just as terrifying (because many of us were still kids watching movies like ""Poltergeist"", some of us more sensitive than others to those scares or the more minor ones in family friendly movies like ""E.T."") as when we were young kids throwing popcorn into the air because we jumped so high.I know it sounds like something stupid, but those were moments of sincere ENJOYMENT for many of us 80's kids. This movie takes place in the 80's, calls to mind (very deliberately and straight to your face many times) that era... and still manages to keep a modern audience entertained. Now, I don't call for total originality in a story line. I am perfectly fine with the very familiar and been-done concepts that are common horror/fantasy/sci-fi tropes nowadays. As long as it isn't boringly so, I am able to be entertained by something I've seen before in one way or another.This is not quite that movie. It is filled with all those very familiar things ... but it manages to mix them up just right, and lacks many (if not all) of the cringe worthy dialogue and tropes that we know so well from overuse. And... it left it with plenty of closure that could mean trauma from the events in the series will always haunt the characters just as they hopefully will the audience - or that there will be more to come.Dear God... I know a season 2 will probably blow it... but let there be more to come!!!!!!"
927,"As some of you may know, when Netfilx produces a series each season is available to watch in full, at once, as opposed to episode by episode... I happen to prefer this method of delivery as it allows the viewer to complete a whole ""book in a series"" (for lack of a better analogy), in their own time rather than ""chapter by chapter"" at the behest of any given network... I find this especially helpful when a series reads more like a movie and follows the characters and how their relationships shape events... As opposed to a storyline that is strung together by a series of events within the same genre and where the main characters' lives only add a background element to the story (think CSI or Law & Order)... With that said, I was hooked after ""Chapter One"" and enthusiastically completed the first season within 24 hours!!When it comes to nostalgia, the 1980's are my favorite cinematic decade. So many great classics were created and produced by iconic filmmakers such as John Hughes, Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Rob Reiner, Ridley Scott and Tim Burton, just to name a small few And I have yet to see a remake or updated version of an '80s flick which has even come close to doing the original justice! However, there is something positive to be said about the rise of television shows in which the plots are being meticulously created and told within a relevant era from the past I believe ""Stranger Things"" has done a stellar job of accomplishing just this feat.In this first season, the young cast does the show a great justice by drawing the viewer into a very relatable and memorable decade from our past. Through the use of various inspirations from '80s pop culture and by keeping true to the look and feel of this particular time period, the writers have created an impressive world for viewers to connect with and get sucked into! Without giving too much away and inadvertently spoiling this season for you, I'll simply describe ""Stranger Things"" as ""The Goonies"" meets ""E.T."" in a twisted, interdimensional game of Dungeons & Dragons (as if written by Steven King and directed by Spielberg) This is, of course, my own personal take on the plot So, I can't promise that you'll agree with my comparisons, but if anything you've read above has peaked your interest and/or you enjoy being warped to another time and place, then I definitely urge you to check this show out for yourself!"
928,"Usually, I'm not super excited about new shows on netflix when they pop up on there. But this one seemed alright, so I gave it a shot.And ohh my God was this a phenomenal show!I read a review that described this show as a mix between Steven King and Spielberg's works from the 80's and it totally feels that way.It is a mix of genres, drama, horror, mystery, sci-fi, supernatural thriller and so on. But knows what it is going for and what it is about, so it is more of a synergy than a hodgepodge of genres and tones.There's a certain metaphor that runs through the season with the kids that I found brilliant and comedic at times. It sort of tied the series and its events together, but I can't give any more details.The acting was superb, from the kids to the adults. No weak performances whatsoever. The direction was also excellent. This had real weight. You cared about the characters and their interactions and attachments with each other. You felt the drama. It wasn't just thrown at you trying to make you feel something like many dramas can do.What I found original was that there was three layers of main characters, each with their own part to play in the mystery. The adult main characters, the teenagers and the kids. And each with their own arcs in relation to the other characters in their level of age.I loved the synthesized soundtrack, that truly set the tone and setting. If I had to nitpick, I would say that the bullies were the standard antagonists to drive the plot and drama with the kids, but the actors in those roles still acted well and they were secondary characters.This is one show that truly deserves the hype and ratings it is getting. I don't know who these Duffer brothers are, but they may be destined for more."
929,"After watching season 3 I was simply amazed by the change of genre intensity which was going on..
Many may dislike season 3 is plenty more violent and dark. But hey if Harry Potter evolves from a child teen fantasy movie to a violent and action driven adult movie no one complains.
Stranger Things indeed got more this way and I love it. Really gives that Main dark shadow theme suspense !
If you wanna see happy 80s Kids dating around go watch something else!"
930,"Season 1 hooked me, season 2 was still binge worthy, season three was watchable but better as a daily or weekly dose. So 7 stars is the average of all three seasons. Who knows, season four might bump it up. Complements to the cast and crew for creating a great period piece that made me feel like an 80s teen again. I feel like season three lacked the edginess the first two seasons had."
931,I want this to never end love it so so much after watching this the characters are like real life persons
932,"The first two seasons were really exciting, but the third one... What happened to the creators of the series? Why did it turn into a comedy with caricatured and frankly ugly characters, completely unlike what they were in previous seasons? I'm now watching the fourth episode of the third season and I am seriously considering to quit, because it's not ""Stranger Things"". This is trash which is kinda: look, eighties! we are eighties!
I rate it at six points. Ten for the first season, eight for the second and one for the third."
933,"I watched the first series and at the end it was just stupid. Much ado about nothing. The kids in the series wanted $50.00 per autograph at Fan Expo, and I think this is a flash in the pan. In a few years we won't remember who they are."
934,"Finished watching Stranger Things 3 and wasn't impressed, lazy writing cliche and expected scenes, way too much violence.. just a big letdown, only redeeming quality is the chemistry of the kids. Too bad they stuck to what they think is a ""winning formula"" it isn't, just a repeat of a white washed version of seasons 1 & 2 which doesn't make it good. They could have done this in 4 maybe 5 shows not 8.Oh well Netflix sold out to formula and waaaay too much product placements to the point of distraction.Was hard to watch this season IF there is a season 4 hopefully it will be a turn to originality and not a sell out.Eh well guess it's entertainment"
935,"Even though I grew up in the 90s, this reminds me of my youth. Biking around, making ""scary"" movies with my parents Hi-8 Sony Video camcorder. I'm not usually a huge sci-fi gal, but I love this show. Beautiful story telling and talented actors."
936,"Why nancy just crawl in that tree without 2nd thoughts. And barb is just dead and nobody seems to realy care but nancy.
Defenetly worth watching tho :)"
937,This series is one of the most overrated Netflix series
938,"Wonderful homage to the films of the 70's and 80's. There is heavy leaning on John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus, Joe Dante, and Tobe Hooper among others. If you are of the correct generation, Boomer myself, you can watch for the numerous allusions; and applaud the set and costume designer for the collection of memorabilia you can spot. Pretty sure I saw an AMC Pacer and Gremlin on the streets. The story moves along at a brisk pace and each episode ends with a cliff-hanger that just about demands you stay and binge watch the entire series: thankfully there were only eight episodes because my wife and I were up until one a.m. finishing off series one. Both of us were impressed with the acting of the young ""Goonies""; and we argued over who David Harbour reminded us of: I am holding to my opinion of Jack Nicholson. And Winona Ryder just disappeared into Joyce Byers. Overall, a fun roller coaster that comes to a satisfactory stop, and the promise of a bigger and faster ride coming for those of us in the queue."
939,"Now I know they have a lot of reviews about this Netflix original show but not many shows do I give a 10 stars too so I thought why not explain my admiration very quickly about this series. I'm 36 born 1980 so these kids were pretty much my age when this show was set which is a throwback 70's 80's horror mystery. Now it's not the terrifying slasher knife wielding or ghostly horror yet it does involve some creepy scenes with disgusting gooey dimensions and a monster. But it is all done masterfully and with perfect timing. now in a few of the early episodes I felt myself getting impatient wanting more but then I realized I needed to slow down and give the story a chance to unveil itself properly and it definitely does. I don't wanna give anything away because the acting of everyone in the series was superb the score gives you the eerie feeling without being corny the writing directing and filming I know will win awards and it's a series that will reel you in no matter what genre of movies your into because it has it all horror ,mystery,comedy,action and a touch of romance now I always ask myself why do I continue to keep my Netflix account with the repetitive movies and the delay in new arrivals but then I always remember I have about 10 shows I love and they are all Netflix originals and now ""Stranger Things"" is at the top of the list. Since this series is more like a long movie I don't know how long they can keep this up but I am rooting for this to be the first of many more to come."
940,"Much lovable tv series ever, stranger things will be one of best Netflix originals, recommended for every age group.. after every episode it's get a way more better than the previous, this science fiction has that thrilling drama but not that scary.
More Than Expectations
Never Better Characters
Netflix And Chill"
941,My Friend Suggested This To Me And Now This Is My No.1 Favorite Now. Season 3 Was Awsome And Now I Can't Wait For Season 4. It Is So Addictive And I Loved It!
942,"I've loved the show, the first day i watched it and it makes me want to be an actor!"
943,"Season 1This series sets environment right from the start of its first episode. The plot of the series is very interesting. Storyline keeps you engaged. The Duffer Brothers has directed the series so well. Each and every scene looks completely new. As the series progresses the environment becomes so tense and scary. It keeps you at the edge of your seat.The acting is outstanding from the entire cast. Each character has portrayed its role with absolute perfection.The background music is excellent. Visual effects are also good. In the tense and scary scenes background score makes your spine chill.Overall, ""Stranger Things"" is a must watch series!Season 2Second season is a good continuation of the first season. Storyline is good this time also. In second season bond between characters is shown beautifully. There's much time given for character development so we feel more connected to the characters this season. Last few episodes are very tense and you will be thrilled by the climax.Season 3Despite being Netflix's most streamed series (65M+ views for the third season), I wonder why people criticise this third season. Strange things get on a bigger level in the third season. Problem is now bigger to face. This season is very interesting to watch.
Waiting for the fourth season..."
944,I have been impressed with Netflix original tv series and been binge watching all the episodes and seasons and I have to say this is very well written series if you need something to watch I recommend stranger things you won't be disappointed because the twists and plots get interesting and the characters are great
945,"I did not expect to be so entertaining. Fantastic script, scenery and acting!"
946,"Who doesn't like strange things combined with the 80's? People need to stop complaining as this show is great! It's got tongue and cheek, big scary monsters/monster, great cast, story line, killer music and keeps me coming back for more!!! Cannot wait for the next season."
947,"Season 1 is brilliant. It will constantly be turning your head upside down
The theme of the old school feel in the show is amazing, I loved every minute of it."
948,"Loved the first season, watched the second season, hated the third season... hopefully season 4 gets better"
949,"I, like most people, enjoy shows the most when they have a combination of certain elements; quality acting, a topic of interest to me, a fitting soundtrack, proper character development, etc. Above all of those qualities though, sits the most important aspect of a television series or movie - the ability to draw emotional involvement from the viewer. A select few have had the capacity to foster the bittersweet happiness that comes from finishing something you've been so invested in. It's an odd thing when something can evoke sadness - and yet a sadness you don't wish to push away, but to wallow in, if at least for a little while. Stranger Things has met that mark.A particularly interesting part of this series is the journey of maturation the child actors are partaking in. It goes without saying that Millie Bobby Brown is a shooting star in the acting world and is far from her zenith. The rest of the party performs laudably, and seeing them get their big break is a fun thing to behold.David Harbour complements Millie's performance with a terrific effort as Chief Jim Hopper. Both excel in portraying the qualities which define what it is to be human; the idiosyncrasies, the varied nature of our individual capabilities, and the ways in which we cope with these strengths and weaknesses.The plot of the show, while not bad, fails to live up to the far-reaching standards of the other aspects. Especially in Season Three, it seems a struggle to find ways to continue the plot; sometimes resulting in contrived and lackluster turns. Despite these shortcomings, this show remains a phenomenon which I'm happy to have experienced."
950,"There are 3 seasons, and all 3 were the same. Something happens to Will, then Joyce feels it and investigates with Hopper. Everybody else joins the investigation. Eleven does that thing where she sees the bad guy, and of course the bad guy is somehow connected to the Upside Down, everyone figures out what the problem is, now they sre trying to figure out how to destroy it. Of course, not everythinf goes according to plan, and when they are about to die, there she is. Eleven comes and solves the problem with her powers and they live happily ever after... Untill something happens to Will again...
All in all, it is an interesting show, worth to watch, but it gets boring. They better change something in season 4"
951,"Season 1 up until 3 was a masterpiece. The suspense was there, the humor, and don't forget the monsters. A full package of a work of art."
952,"Absolutely enthralling. Great cast and story lines, wanting to immediately press play on the next episode as soon the previous ends.Superb writing mixing sci-fi, drama and horror in an 80s setting.Thank you Netflix's for providing a high quality alternative to a lot of the poor domestic telly shows.Bring on season 4!"
953,"This is my favourite show and it truly is the best show out there. it touches on thriller and comedy and even romance and it shows the children growing up and evolving alongside each other whilst their town is being taken over by darkness,it has such a great cast, not just children but adults too, i couldn't think of more perfect actors for those partsmillie bobby brown, who plays eleven, really becomes her character and makes every connection look real and i start to believe it at some points that the connection with hopper, mike and other characters aren't just acted, if you know what i mean. because some times people just don't click on screen but millie it makes it happen!!!!if you have yet to watch this show. i really recommend! i love it so much and i can't wait for season 4"
954,"I have watched alot of Netflix shows and non Netflix shows and NONE of them can touch Stranger Things, Noah Scnapp (Will Byers) , Gaten Matarazza(Dustin Henderson) in my eyes did the best but every character in this show was picked absolutely perfect you couldn't find better actors to play these Roles! I've never acted but if I was able to pick one show to be in this would be my pick no doubt, if you are gonna watch one show on Netflix to watch Stranger Things need to be your pick or Trailer Park Boys my next favorite show! Lol"
955,"Not enough is written about casting directors. I, like most, have watched and absorbed a tremendous amount of content in recent years. And like many, I've followed directors or writers or show runners. This is not a bad way to find good content. If you like Soderbergh, you might like the Safdies. If you like Sorkin, you might like Palladino. If you like Larry David, you might like Mike Schur. I urge you all to start to pay attention to casting directors. And you may want to start with Carmen Cuba. To make a crude comparison, you could turn to sports. NFL coaching trees are an interesting comparison. Great NFL coaches, generally, beget great NFL coaches. The same can be said for directors and writers.
To this point, check out Carmen Cuba's ""tree"". And check out the work that she has done. And Stranger Things May be her magnum opus (although I hope not). Think about how difficult it must be to cast children. Trying to envision not just now, but 2 or 4 or 6 years down the road. It takes an exceptional talent to create an ensemble like Stranger Things. From revitalizing a career, to jump starting a career to making a career.
Cheers to you Carmen! I can't wait to see what you do next."
956,"Watched during the quarantine. Like the show. Saw the whole series. The first 2 seasons are very good.
Rating....
Season 1 - 10/10
Season 2 - 9.5/10
Season 3 - 8.5/10In the third season you got many illogical correlation and references but its entertaining.Overall rating - 9/10 & yeah thats good if you are a sci-fi ,thriller genre fan."
957,"I have never been so hooked to a show!! I bingewatched it all the way through, all 3 seasons!! It is an 80's based series that focuses on Will's disappearance. I don't know what other show is like this show because it is so unique. 10/10!"
958,"All 3 seasons are amazing, the plot is full of surprises and non stop twists, never have seen a show with that kind of breathtaking pace to tell a story. It should be a 10 for a tv show like this, but Winona Ryder's stressful performance in every second makes me...... STRESSFUL! Simply overacting! Hope to see less veins from her face in the 4th season."
959,"I was born in 1967. I turned 13 in 1980 and 20 in 1987, making me close to Steve & Nancy's age. Our generation was the generation that went from our parents 50s culture to the beginning of the technology revolution. I remember when Space Invaders, Dinkey Kong's and PAC-Man came out. We were amazed! The 80s were and age where there was danger but it was still closer to the safe era that the 50s are portrayed as. Everything in this series screams 1980s! I grew up in CA and my parents divorced in 82 when I was 14. I got to spend time in Western NC with my dad & actually went my Jr. year of high school there in 83-84. Our style in CA was completely different than NC and I find it incredible how well they got the IN 80s culture down to a T! So that being said, I like S01 to be the best and a mixture of all things 80s. S02 was a letdown but still watchable but definitely suffered the sophomore slump. S03 was a definite improvement! I give S01 a 10. S02 a 6.5 & S03 an 8. S01 was completely perfect. I found no flaws in it and it was the best thing I had watched since The X-Files with Mulder & Scully. S01 could have been stand alone but I feel like they did the right thing and kept going. S02 was a letdown yet still palatable. I felt it was rushed and awkward in many scenes. Sean Astin was great as usual but a bit too nerdy and clean cut for Joyce, Winona Ryder. I did not like the Dart dog as a pet and the rotten pumpkin fields and tunnels and 11s sister and her scenes were totally unwarranted unless they use her in S04 to somehow to save Hopper or fight 11 if she goes dark. 11 visiting her mom made no real sense. Like I said they could have done completed without S02 but thinking about it they did need something there to let the kids age a bit and to tell some back story. They definitely could of done a better job. S03 is close to being my favorite as the kids we're closer to my age at that point in time 1985. I graduated HS at 17 because I was born in late November. So I was really between 20 year old Steve, same age probably as Nancy & Jonathan & 2-3 years older than the rest. But yes in 1985 Russia was our WORST Cold War enemy! It's not like now where the Middle East is our boogie man. Everything was about beating the Russians and their Godless communist way of life. My kids who were born in 1998, 2000 & 2004 ask me what being a teen was like then and I'd have to say it was closer to our parents 50s teen years then our kids teen years. I told them homosexuality was not out in the open, talked about and no one definitely came out and this was 2 hours North of Los Angeles not backwards small town Indiana! We don't didn't have cable and if you did you got like 13 channels. No cell phones, no answering machines, not even cordless phones! We had video games at the arcade, the very 1st Atari home game came out and life was simple. No CDs, no VCRs, formulaic television almost to a Tee. The greatest movies and music came from the 80s. Big hair, fashion, smoking weed, drinking, house parties! Life was so much simpler back then and the Duffer brothers capture its essence perfectly! We loved Friday the 13th, Halloween, Nightmare on Elm St, the 80s were a prosperous, relatively peaceful time where you could go to school and not worry about school shootings or all your friend being addicted to opiates and dying from overdoses. Yes kids did die from drinking and driving and suicide and it was tragic but it was rare, not an every hour occurrence that it is nowadays. The Duffer brothers capture this and a good mash up of all those great 80s movies and music not just in the horror or pop music genres. I lived my entire teenage years in the 1980s and I feel blessed. This series captures that magic with horror but also comedy, romance, mystery, excitement, everything you could think of like an 80s smorgasborg. The few thing I didn't fully agree with Robin being a lesbian, not that I care or that it wasn't there, I just don't see a high school teenage girl telling a guy she was gay in 1985 Indiana. Really thinking about it that was about it and it was very minor. All in all this is a 9.5 as a series just because S02 could've been much better and explanatory without all the useless stuff. My advice, take a chance and just accept it for what it is. An entertaining look into the past that was the 1980s but also a great horror/ adventure movie."
960,"This is an interesting show.It feels like a 80s mash.No,the plot is not generic.That is not one of its strengths(it is a mash of movies).The strength is that it mashes movies and makes it good.It uses the all the good stuff in the eighties and mixes them together into a blender.And it is a hell of a blender."
961,"It starts really well. You get attached immediately, you start admiring the direction work they did, environment, characters, everything... But it doesn't last so long. When it goes over the different seasons, the series starts to get some weirder villians, the script, the series itself demands it to be so, but they're so weird that you don't understand how they can appear; and it's not improving when it comes to their abilities: they seem imposing, but stupid and good-for-nothing when fighting."
962,"It was wonderful
To amazing
But number 3 ending was weird
But hey there will be a 4"
963,"The whole decade of the '80s was excessive, cheesy, and over the top. Most of the reviews I see on here are either young or forgetful. The same people that love Scarface (which is a terrible movie). Let's be honest it's got the same feel and bad acting as a sex ed video in health class. I can name many many more. It wasn't perfect but it was fun. And fun is the reason you watch. Be pretentious on how underground music is better.
While I'm here remember the Cold War? Russia was the direct threat. I can name 50 movies in the 80's that address that circumstance."
964,"Honestly felt like this was the best Season out of all 3, was never a dull moment and it flowed really well to the point, it was finished rather quickly.. which was sad for me. This Season was amazingly entertaining and was much scarier than the other seasons! There was product placement for the 'New Cocacola' but it's not available in the UK, so I didn't think too much about it. Don't know why there are so many negative reviews tbh, must be an IMDB domino effect because I haven't met someone in person tell me they hated the latest season, and you can really see the passion from all members of the cast and how hard the whole show must've put in to make this Season as good as what it was!"
965,"It's no doubt one nice tv show to sit and binge watch. However, I feel the quality and consistency of the story and some characters development have been neglected more and more in season 3. Look at the sheriff's performance, in season 3 he just became this reckless and annoying character trying to be funny and screaming all the time - it's like all the adults need to be comic but it seems forced and unnatural. Season 1 was funny and yet more well balanced with great performances.
And some of the dialogues seem to be there just to fill out the blank, pretty lame.
From all the characters, the kids performance are the ones that keep me watching Strager Things - they are doing a great job and it's rewarding to follow them growing.
Finally, I wish they would explore more of the 80's cultural references - as it's, in my opinion, what brings the nostalgia feeling and make this tv show such a success."
966,"Give this a try it is Riveting! This is a show for everyone, I havent met one person that doesnt like this show. Everyone who watches it loves it. If you dont like it trust me your the NOT in the majority. If your one of those people dont embarrass your self by saying you dont like it because that a lie it has everything that makes a fun, exciting and entertaining show."
967,"This review is based only on the first series.Script: This series captivated me for the first 4 or 5 episodes. It seemed to me like a very intelligently written occult thriller. I was wondering about what relatlions would be laid in all occurrences. Then, somewhere half way, holes appeared in the intelligent written story. I remember the first occurrence where the sherriff succeeded in getting all by himself into the core of a heavily guarded secret millitary base, after which he was put to sleep and brought home instead of killed (while the millitary had no problem in killing the snackbar holder). Next was Nancy creeping into the gate while she knew a monster was lurking there. From there all intelligence was thrown overboard and the story turned around from an intelligently written occult thriller to an unintelligently written monster-science fiiction story wherein hardly any answers about former occurrences were given. The plot in the last episode was the climax of the dumb turn the series took. Where the series started out with a beautiful slow pace the ending was absolutely hurried off.Acting: The acting was overall good. The acting of the little girl Eleven was superb and the grown-ups did a good job too. The acting of the other children was not always convincing. I got much distracted by the anorexia of the teenage girl. Why did they cast her? She really looked unhealthy and I hope in real life she is getting some help with that.Context: With this I mean visuals, audio, etc. The series overall created a very atmospheric and creepy context around the story. They did a good job with that. The monster however was absolutely uninspired.Conclusion: I started out being extremely enthousiastic about this series but in the end it was a let-down. 7 stars thanks to a very captivating first half of the series."
968,"To me, a project is either good or bad. A Yes, I would recommend it to others or a No, don't waste your time.
My reviews are based on my experience and are only my opinion.
I hope they help you when deciding what to watch and what to avoid."
969,"I think that Stranger Things is an awesome show. It keeps you wanting more and its a breath of fresh air to have really talented children as the main characters in a show that is not necessarily aimed at younger viewers but adults as well.I do however think the show has been so hyped up and slightly overrated when there are shows which don't get the recognition they deserve and are just as good, if not better than Stranger Things!"
970,Im 26 years old and I've been told of this show so much that's it's amazing and I just got around to watch it now (2018) and the moment I watched the first episode I got hooked! I binge watched the whole seasons and I can't wait for the next one!!!!
971,"As a huge Stephen King fan, I definitely wanted to check this out. This series was the only reason I got a Netflix account actually. I don't usually like TV shows or too many series-with the exception of ""Orange Is the New Black-but this was ABSOLUTELY worth it!! WOW!!!!!!!!!!! I cannot say enough about the cast, the score, the sound effects, the cinematography, the story line, the characters, the acting, and the way they make it totally FEEL like I stepped into a time-machine. I grew up in the 80's and I read everything Stephen King wrote on those days. I'm IN LOVE with this series!!!!"
972,"More like a rip-off to Super 8 (2011), but still you won't get any rip-off's for 80's classics like this, television series Stranger Things : Season 01 is an amazing homage to the 80's films with such style and specially it's techno music.And why this becomes personal is as a childhood fanatic of young adult books of ""R.L. Stine's Goosebumps"" and ""M.D. Spencer's Shivers"" this is a dream come true.Reminds me of the 80's and specially Steven Spielberg's E.T.Overall - 5/5"
973,"1st series
8/10
Superb
80s feel
Just a great series.. acting isn't bad at all.
The chemistry between characters is great.Series 2
Slightly different
I'll give it 5/10
Did seem to fall compared to The first series..
But not unwatchable."
974,"This show has everything - great actors, a great plot, a great setting, great characters, and so much more. I started and finished the two seasons in less than a week because I couldnt stop watchingAnd I can't wait for season 3!"
975,"This show is one of those shows where you don't know anything in the beginning, but in the end, you end up falling in love with the plot, the music, the characters, and everything from the show. The performances from the adult cast, the teen cast and the kids cast are astounding and fantastic.Every new chapter is nail-bitting, suspensful, bone-chilling and magic and fantastic.ST is one of those shows that demands - and deserves - to be called ""an instant cult classic from beginning to end"". If you're a Spielberg and King fan who is so in despair for looking at this project that mixes the two together, don't worry, your search is over, because now you have Stranger Things. Rush it and see it alerady. You won't be dissapointed. You can thank me later."
976,"This is the best show ever. Once you start watching you will become obsessed. The actors are wonderful. It's a drama, horror, coming of age, inter dimensional, truly amazing show. I guarantee you will love Stranger Things!"
977,"This show is the best in my opinion since Grimm! Like all tv and music I totally have my head in the ground - and never heard of Stranger Things until I stumbled upon it on Netflix and started binge watching!!! I loved every single second of it!!! I watched all two seasons in about 5 days. The young and older cast are superb- as an 80's kid all my favorites are in it Winona - Mikey from Goonies, and of course Paul Rieser - I mean come on!! So good- definitely and 80's vibe- and kind of a Goonies vibe. Can not wait for season three!!! Well done all.... I don't get the one star people- really- just admit it is not your genre and move on. :)"
978,"This is awesome! Just watch it! The children are fantastic actors and are going to achieve lots in the future! Winona is still achingly beautiful! The clothes, the music, the hair, the cars, the houses, the wallpaper, the carpets, the decor, the kids arcade games, etc, etc, etc, it all works and is totally wicked!!!"
979,"Best series ever! This is my favourite, and Mileven:)"
980,"This is like everyone else says a extreme case of ""the 80's"".
It does an amazing job of boiling it down and is to me a type of time travel. 
While im hardly knowledgeable enough to know exactly what it is they copied i recognize it without knowing its names.
They do a impressive job of it, while the 80's certainly had its flaws it had loads of charm and it produced some cute and horrible movies and shows.
BUT and here comes my own issue with this series its a mashup of ALL types of of 80's shows comedy horror and drama.
In the 80s you could never have made this Frankenstein of horror-comedy-drama show the mixing makes it feel almost modern.
As a chef if you want to do a asian dish you dont take every single spice from the whole asian kitchen and then add it all into a single dish, this is common sense right?Toke me forever to define it into words what i felt in my stomach while watching it.
Still even so the nostalgia did its trick on me and even flawed i had a great time watching this.
For my age group this is likely some serious catnip irresistible stuff"
981,"This could be easily, the best TV show of the genre in the most recent years.The plot is interesting and makes you want to keep going, and the actors' outstanding performance, especially Noah Schnapp's in Season Two, is just amazing.10/10 Already Re-watching for the third time"
982,"By all the series I have watched. This one definetely tops them all. I love this series, haven't watched anything as good as this before. If you are not into ''aliens'' like my sister said she weren't, then watch it anyways, because it's not aliens. And this series offers so much other. I also love the characters, so good acting! Funny as well. Both seasons is also a bit different from each others, which is such a good concept to do! This series is amazing, watch it whatever you like."
983,"Stranger things is quite the show, an 80's setting, nostalgia, lovable characters, plot twists, and a phenomenal plot where you don't get lost in it. But the absolute best part of this show in my opinion is the sound, you may not even realize this until you go back and watch the seasons but sound is crucial to our emotions throughout the show in both seasons.At several points in the show, it cuts to a scene and you only hear one sound and that sound is then used more frequently in that same scene and most often these sounds can and will lead to expectation subversion at some point. Overall, the sound and music all works well together, and only betters the show."
984,"First of all let me tell you this; this series deserves its ranking from top to bottom.It can never be expressed well enough how well-done this series is... You are gonna have to watch it yourself. The intellectual, retrospectual, fiction and horror elements in this series with ingenious directing and acting combined made possible an overwhelming experience that catches audience off-guard. The slow but definitive pace of progression starting with Steven-Spielberg-ish elements, turning into a more like Stephen-King story gives you thrill and shivers through out the series. Story is so amazing, you feel that you are so familiar to it but you still do not know what will happen next and what happens next is so satisfactory in many levels, you cannot stop thinking how much you love this series. It is one of the best series i watched lately without any doubt.10/10"
985,"This show will be a classic, well it is for me already. it takes place in the early eighties! There is not much greatness in the Eighties but this definitely changes opinions. Like all Netflix shows, the actors were on point, they all seamed to have perfect chemistry. The show was sort of dark, eerie, but had humor here and there, all in the best kind of way. ever since watching this I've been curious to watch the x files series because that's what it reminds me of. I seriously cant wait to watch season 2, especially after watching the trailer for it, so much mystery I highly recommend this show to everyone, now find out for yourself!"
986,"Alright, I gave this a 7, but I truly loved the show and hope that there will be more to come. Let's start with the negative: - One of the things I disliked from this show - and from a great many other shows - is, what seems to me, the use of useless scenes, or ''fillers''. The teenage ''romance'' between Nancy and Steve is entirely unnecessary, and just slows down the pace of the show for no reason - except for wasting airtime. As such, it falls short of other tightly-written or directed TV series such as London Spy, The Night Manager, Humans, and The Man in the High Castle - to name a few. Every scene and word in these shows are clues and propel the program forward. There is not a single word wasted. - Another thing that annoyed me was the cartoon-ish acting of some of the characters: the two policemen, the librarian, and other minor characters. While this may be funny in comic books, in my experience, real-life people don't act or talk that way. - And my last negative point, which some here have pointed out, is the constant annoying whining from Joyce (Winona Ryder). It almost makes us not feel sorry for her plight. Now, on to more positive things!: - The acting of 11 is almost beyond belief. It was almost like a fully grown adult had inhabited a child's body. When I went (had to) go dig up some info on her and found out that her parents were Brits, I wasn't surprised. Great acting and presence is somehow in their DNA! - While I loved the music, I found that both the electronic and the pop stuff were out of place for this show. The electronic score would have better suited Tron or something slicker. I also doubt that Echo & the Bunnymen were the hit of the year in small town America. Then again, Jonathan was an ''different'' - so who knows. I'm really looking forward to how they will continue this. Or maybe, they can do like the Brits, and just end it on a high note, and make something entirely different."
987,"Hopefully Stranger Things will add a second season, as the first was one of the best series I have ever enjoyed. Throw out any preconceived notions about whether it's ""hokey"" and try watching just two episodes. You have a better than 90% chance of enjoying it. I rolled my eyes at first, thinking: how could an 8-episode series of an '80s throwback be something worth watching? The previews showed influences of Close Encounters, E.T., Goonies and even Silent Hill, and I wasn't interested in embracing the nostalgic aspect. The opening credits really dug right into the 1980's, and even the title slid in as if it suggested that Stephen King's own name would burn into my LCD screen. I'll just get right into the meat and potatoes. All the players work, all the scenery, action, editing, and photography really create a great series. I can't think of any one episode that they could have thrown out, because they all really go well together. As for the kids, the one fear I have is that these child actors are getting older. They can't keep riding their bikes and talking with lisps. So I can't imagine that Stranger Things will have a long run, unless they wind up doing away with them, or changing up the story altogether. And that would be a shame because the talent of all those kids is DEEP. Take for example, Millie Bobby Brown (who plays El). So few words come out of her mouth, yet her expressions and emotions carry so well. The kids are like Our Gang - you just fantasize of becoming a kid again, grabbing your bike with its reflectors and streamers, and hanging out with them after school. One typically might expect that kids running about on their own to make things right in their neighborhood is rather hackneyed, but the writing and execution of the plot for each episode kept driving action, adventure, mystery and drama, without it ever feeling as if it were getting stale or bogged down. Even when the story had to explain things, the characters got right to the point and took action. Only a couple of the adults played central characters and they certainly did well also. Chief Jim Hopper and Joyce Byers are introduced as people with some shredded back stories, and the Duffer Brothers - the writers / directors - slowly peel back the layers of their pasts. I put Stranger Things beyond The Walking Dead and Peaky Blinders, into Breaking Bad territory - not to compare whether it's ""better"" than any of my favorites, because it's so different than any other series."
988,"I'm a sucker for 80s nostalgia, so I was excited when I heard about Stranger Things. The show is a homage to the movies and books of that decade, with references to Stand By Me, The Goonies, E.T., Poltergeist, Nightmare on Elm Street, Alien, Commando, among many others. It's good, thrilling popcorn entertainment that, no, is not the best series ever created, but does the job of keeping you entertained and interested.The one thing I really like about this series is how humanized all the main characters are. You have the four main protagonists, geeky preteen boys who live by the codes of the comic books they read. They communicate on walkie talkies, transport themselves on dirt bikes, snack on pudding, and basically know all the ""secret spots"" of their Anytown USA setting. You have the ""little miss perfect"" older sister who rebels for the first time and dates the popular jock. You have the divorced mother who is barely keeping it together while raising her two sons. You have the older brother who doesn't trust authority. You have the moody cop who hates his current life. Then, of course, you have Eleven (""El""), the superhuman little girl who wants a normal life and some Eggos. The acting is actually very well done and you immediately grow to like all the characters, except maybe the bullies. I do have a few bones to pick. One, some of the writing is weak and not fully flushed out, resulting in stories not going anywhere, some disappearing without notice, and others slightly corny and clichéd, which at times can be charming (this is suppose to be the 80s, after all), and other times eye rolling. Also, some of the action seems anti-climatic, with resolutions seemingly way too easy. The other thing too is the show toes a thin line between homage and plagiarism. I think for the most part it keeps the balance, but some parts it gets dangerously close. I also have some concerns of this going another season. This seems more mini-series than not, but I'm curious as what direction the show will go in the new season. Will it be the same story and characters? Same characters and new story? New stories and new characters? I guess we wait and see.Overall, Netflix put together a great summer series. Heat warming, thrilling, nostalgic, I wish we could find that creativity of Spielberg, King, Craven and Lucas, among others, of the 80s that resulted in some of the most original work out there instead of superhero and remakes over and over."
989,"This show is science fiction for noobs.It is ridiculous. Season 1 was okay because the idea seemed fresh, garbage nonetheless, but season 2 and 3 is merely a copy of the garbage.
Zero multiplied by anything is zero, so since season 1 is basically garbage, no matter how many times you try to show the same thing in a different manner, no matter how much you spend on marketing, and makeup and paying the actors for bad acting, it will still be garbage.Yikes."
990,"Excellent, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and you're left wanting more! The three seasons are excellent!"
991,"UPDATE - July 7, 2019
Below was my original review. I gave it two stars. I decided to watch the next episode. I'm so glad I did. It got really good. I binged watched the rest. That said. Here's the thing. Winona Ryder deserves an Academy Award. Her acting is incrediable!What I don't like is that it's so drawn out. The first few episodes you have to just sit there waiting...for the last few episodes where it gets good. I get you want to give the story about the characters. But it's way to boring and drawn out. I use the fast forward button on my Roku a lot to skip over a lot of the parts.The problem is that I most likely won't ever re-watch the season's again because it's so drawn out (boring) in many of the episodes :/------I've tried watching it twice. Finally, yesterday, the 4th of July, I pushed passed the first ten minutes. You have to gain my attention within the first 20 minutes or I pass on the show. I made it through the 1st episode. Luckily, I was bored and was playing on my phone. I kept letting the episodes auto play. Then I started on a new book I'm writing. Still on auto-play. It was untill epsiode 6 that it caught my attention. But, still wasn't hooked. It wasn't until episode 7. Then I put the phone down. It got exciting. Watched episode seven and eight. Instead of turning off the TV after finally making it through season1 I wanted to watch season 2.Then it happen. Once again. It got borring. So drawn out. OMG, just get to it. I'm on episode 4 now. Just ended with season 3 and turned off the TV. It's to boring and drawn out. Get to it!Tonight, forget it. I rather take my time and watch Star Trek Disocery season 2 again. Now, that show is awesome! Keeps you plugged in. Keeps you wanting to know what happens next.My final thoughts on Strager Things is summed up in one word:
Yawn!"

994,"It's the best show for teens
We don't feel any lag
There is a lot of fiction but it's very entertaining"
995,"It isn't an overly breathtaking masterpiece in drama but as a nostalgic, intriguing, mysterious horror sci-fi mystery series it's absolutely top notch entertainment. There's a vast majority of people out there who absolutely love this show, I guess to an extent I am one of these people. What can I say, I love the eighties, horror, mystery, sci-fi, and drama - Stranger Things is tense, emotional, and completely fond of these genres that is so much as pays direct homage to the gems within said genres. The show isn't violent, I mean it has some mild gore here and there, but it's built on what's coming next, mysteries and solving them, and paranormal / sci-fi induced horror.The suspense is fantastic, the score is unsettling but wonderful, absolutely magic and I could listen to the theme intro for hours. It builds a superb, sometimes shocking atmosphere, the practical and special effects are great, and the acting is also very good, especially considering the majority of its prominent cast are almost ten years younger than myself. Massive round of applause to them, they're really good. Same goes for the others, the four main being the two adults who are brilliant, David and Winona are both really fine actors, respectively, and the older brother and sister of Will and Mike. I like pretty much all the characters and find no faults and I also enjoy all three series, particularly one but two and three were a great watch. I think the most haunting, compelling view was the first season, but I honestly think it's been a terrific viewing thus far as a whole, and the fourth series can't come soon enough.There have, of course, been a few weaker episodes, so much as a 4 to 5 out of 10 on one of them for me personally, and a couple around a 7 or an 8, but the vast amount are all solid, consistent, entertaining episodes filled with enough to keep me evoked and hooked. If they're going to keep this going to an extent I feel six seasons would be good, nothing surpassing that because it would become too mundane and tiresome, rather it becoming monotonous have it stop there but have the final series be a writing peak, if they can pull it off - there's little doubt in my mind that they cannot, and I'm very hopeful.
S1 for me was 10/10
S2 for me was 9.5/10
S3 for me was 9.5/10Regarding the creatures**, One other thing is, the concept and the look / creation of the demons and characters related to on Stranger Things, I think, are very well done also. The ""Mind Flayer"" and the ""Demogorgons"" as examples, are really interesting and awesome. So big well done on that too. Really, really good series."
996,"I don't watch movies or series often because my attention span is horrible and i quickly lose interest but i fell in love with stranger things as soon as i started watching it. i'm now completely obsessed and finished all of the episodes within a week. it's my favourite show i've ever seen and have now even started buying merchandise. i'm completely obsessed, the casting is just so perfect. honestly i just felt so happy watching it, i don't have friends in real life and felt like i had friends and was a part of the show when i was watching it (hopefully that doesn't sound creepy- i'm a 17 year old female not some weird old dude imagining being friends with a bunch of teenagers lol). honestly got so immersed in it and forgot all about my problems for a while. had a reason to look forward to something (to come home from school and watch stranger things). i struggle a lot and this made me happy basically. this is the best show ever with the best cast, storyline and characters. would love a series without any monsters though with just the characters in their day to day lives. just love everything about this show. thanks for making me happy"
997,"An excellent series must watch by every one....
If ur an dark lover , I will definitely recommend this to you , but one drawback is in every season there will be an boring episode
Expect that every thing is good.."
998,"Literally heart felt in last series.It is an family entertainer which will give you scifi experience, Directors thinking is another level.The way of representation is awesome.LOVED Eagerly waiting for season4."
999,I'm only writing this to give this a 10/10 review.
1000,"Failure to disappoint. This show has been on point from start to finish. Finished season 3 today and was blown away. Stranger Things gets you right in the feels. They couldn't have found a better cast, crew, or platform for this show. The only let down is the time between each season. It leaves you wanting more after every season. I am hoping for at least one or two more seasons. Back to waiting"
1001,I have seen the 2 first epesiode and cant stop watching looks amazinf
1002,"The story, the actors, the characters, the intrigue, all those things make Stranger Things be an excellent show.
Actually, is the best Sci-Fi and horror show I've ever seen in my life. The world is so well built, and it seems so real, the characters and the relationship between them are wonderful and so relatable.
Even though I heard many people saying that is boring, I personally find it very interesting. We have to take time for the story to develop, right?"
1003,"Firstly, what makes this such a stunning show is the nostalgia you get from 80s films is great. From ET to Ghostbusters, there are loads of references. Here is undeniable acting talent, from Winona Ryder's amazing scared performance of a mother trying to find her son. Also hands down best actor from Season 2 is Noah Schnapp ( Will Byers) played and
amazing terrified character. He is played stunningly, you never know how he is going to react to something. Overall I would highly recommend Stranger Things!"
1004,"I can not get over how great this show is. The writing is brilliant, the acting is brilliant (especially for such a young cast) and the production is brilliant. Apart from one episode in season two (everyone who has seen it knows what I'm talking about), the show has been faultless."
1005,"The best television show not called Breaking Bad. Everything about it is just flat out awesome. Great story. Very likeable characters, and good intensity."
1006,"A very atmospheric series, feel the spirit of the 80's. Child actors are nice."
1007,Everything from the casting to the finished product is polished and clean. A must watch.
1008,"Amazing acting
Very good music choice
Impossible to watch only one episode
Absolutely fantastic tv series love it"
1009,"Amazing love every thing about this show!! Love the whole set up, characters, and dialogue. Cant wait for season 3👍🏻👍🏻"
1010,There's something about this show...it will hook you instantly...have binge watched 2 seasons in 2 days.... eagerly waiting for 3rd one
1011,Great show with a good storyline. The story keeps you looking forward for more. What really stands out is the performance of the entire cast. Especially Winona Ryder... She is absolutely awesome. Next thing would be the background score... It really gives you that eerie feeling. I honestly never expected a fantasy thriller to be this good. Looking forward for more.
1012,"Ever since I finished watching the first season of Stranger Things I was extremely anticipating the release of season 2. I thought it wouldn't exceed the first season due to how good it was but all the slow build, the introduction of new characters and again, an awesome soundtrack, Strange Things 2 blew the first season out of the water! With the same characters from the previous season and the addition of Max (Sadie Sink), Bob (Sean Astin), Billy (Dacre Montgomery) and Dr. Owens (Paul Reiser) this show didn't lose a beat, except for the seventh episode which was good but not great although it doesn't deserve the hate its getting. The season starts out with Will starting to imagine himself in the Upside Down and getting chased by a monster and his mother, Joyce is worried about him. While Dustin and Lucas are seeking Max's attention, Mike is helping out Will with his problems while also trying to contact Eleven every day hoping she's alive. As for Nancy and Jonathan, they are out seeking justice for Barb because Nancy can't keep it to herself anymore and wants Barb's parents to know what happened to their daughter. As for Eleven and Hopper? Well you need to watch the season to find out what's going on with them. This season, which feels more like a movie sequel, made me fall in love even more with this show and the level of emotion that the last two episodes bring out are surreal. This has become my favorite series ever because of great acting, music, nostalgia and characters."
1013,"Stranger Things is one of those shows where even if you're not a sci-fi or a thriller fan, it makes you want to keep watching and finish every episode in a single day; that's how good Season 1 was! Nostalgic with it's incredible soundtrack, captivating with amazing acting and even though it's eight episodes long the payoff is incredible and makes you want more. The show is about four friends Mike (The amazingly talented Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Will (Noah Schnapp) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) as one night after a Dungeons and Dragons session at Mike's house Will disappears under strange (no pun intended) circumstances and everyone is freaking out including his mother Joyce (played by the incredible Winona Ryder) and they start looking for him. While searching for Will, Mike, Dustin and Lucas encounter a girl (played by Millie Bobby Brown) in the woods and that's where I'm going to stop talking. As the series progresses you start to feel for the characters and invest in them and that is what I loved most about it. Even though I wasn't even born in the 80's you kind of feel like it's truly 1983 with many movie references and easter eggs that give a certain charm to the show. All in all, this is one of the best series out today and definitely one of the top five of the past 25 years"
1014,"I really liked the 80's vibe the show has. It was very addicting and exciting so I watched a whole season in a very short period. I loved all the characters, they were each very unique and they never got boring. It also isn't really predictable like some other shows or films I watched so that's definitely a good thing. The show and the story telling were really entertaining and I'll be looking forward to see the next season."
1015,"I just love the 80's vibe it gives. It's so well done... the kids are amazing, so much pure talent."
1016,"Amazing series! I watched the first and second season within a week, I was hooked and couldn't stop! I've heard that this series is one of the best representations of what the 80's was actually like. I wasn't alive during that time, but I loved that commentary and I believe it's true. The series didn't seem to shove the typical, cliché, neon, rock n roll 80's down your throat. Every character is beautifully developed, you grow to love all of them! All I can say is that I was I could have been a kid living in Hawkins in this show!"
1017,"I was looking through all of these IMDB reviews, and most of them I completely disagree with. So I thought I'd make my own review about my thoughts on this amazing show.First of all I'd like to praise the acting, and it is great. The child acting is not cringy at all. In fact, it's better acting than what most adults could do. The adult acting is also incredible! So I'd say the acting is perfect!Now I'll talk about the story. I've seen some people saying ""It all relys on nostalgia!"". And as someone whose seen each episode multiple times, I can say that isn't true. Sure, it has lots of nostalgia, but there's also an original story that will keep you hooked from the first episode. Each episode ends with great cliffhangers that make you want to keep watching!And I just want to quickly talk about the dialogue. It's good and believable. There's one line in Season Two that I thought was crap, but everything else is good.I'll briefly talk about some small stuff in this paragraph. First I'll talk about the CGI. It looks pretty good, about the quality of a modern Star Wars movie. Now onto the music, ITS SO GOOOOOD!!So yeah, I love this show and I highly recommend it."
1018,"Stranger Things is totally catching, with its charismatic story, and the great acting, especially David Harbour as Chief Hopper.Well, season one is full of awesomeness, I was totally hooked from the first episode!The story was great, and fitting the number of the episode, to show us every detail!I loved season one of Stranger Things, cause it has 0% problems and 100% awesomeness!Stranger Things season one, is definitely getting a 10/10!Unfortunately, season two didn't follow up with the same greatness, such as season one did!It gave some useless things a great care, like Max, she didn't deserve all that care! And it has a whole unnecessary episode, E07!The story stills great, but it's not great as season one!A big step back, and I'm actually waiting for these problems to be fixed!Stranger Things season two gets an 8/10.So Stranger Things is such a fresh, great and well-performed series! So it will get a 9/10 as a result!"
1019,What an incredible sci fi thriller revolving around the teens. The vision of this shows creators might say resembles with the mutant experimentation(like in XMen) as far as mysterious girl Eleven(their very own Jean Grey) is concern. But how they represents her is pretty unique and interesting. Actoress who played that role done amazing job. Acting of each and every actor in this show is amazing. Acting of teens are one of the highlight.You will surely fall in love with these characters they are as good.And the story and the plot is next to the movie level...amazing..catches the interest of sci fi thriller lover like me.That's why due to such reasons it's getting so much appreciation around the globe I m not surprised...Give a try to it you will surely love it and will make others to watch like I'm doing right now. It will takes care the interest of all.
1020,"I am a teenager, but I am obsessed with everything relating to the 80's. The music is amazing and I love the movie mentions throughout the show. The acting is amazing and the tension they are able to evoke is amazing. The actors do an amazing job of being funny while scared, similar to movies like the Goonies. I do not have a lot to say about the tv show, but it is definitely worth your while.I highly recommend this show! The show is clever with writing and balancing humor with horror. The last thing I will say is that there are character duos that are very well done and very smart. I am very excited for Season 3!"
1021,"Pretty good series, addicting just like any good netflix and really intriuging as well"
1022,"Ok, so I just got done with watching stranger things season 1 after all the hype around it and was feeling left out as everyone around me had already seen it. I'm just gonna say that the show is highly overrated and the 8.9 rating given to this show does not do justice to the other good shows with lower ratings. The show was suspenseful in the beginning but ended up being too childish and not the thriller that I was expecting. The concept of the mystery was a good one but the writers could have just made the show a bit serious by taking off the kids as main characters and adding a more adult vibe to the show. People keep comparing this show to another Netflix series ""Dark"", and I can only say that the Dark is a way more complex and interesting tv series than stranger things and there is no comparison. The background score of that show is absolutely insane. I highly recommend PLEASE watch that show if you haven't."
1023,"This actually a very good show on Netflix. Soundtrack is awesome. Plot is breathtaking. You never get bored. Also, if you love 80s, this serie is for you. Actors are very good though young and relatively inexperienced."
1024,"In the quiet town of Hawkins Indiana, strange things begin to happen. No one ever thought anything bad would happen in this town, yet, abnormal encounters are met between the characters in this series. Stranger Things is originally set in the year 1983. In the newest season of Stranger Things, the time is set one year later in the year 1984. In season 2 of Stranger Things, we meet a few new characters that make this season even stranger.
Sadie Sink is brought to the show playing as the new girl named Max. She eventually joins in on the friend group between Lucas, Mike, Dustin, and Will. Max's brother, Billy, also has a role to the show played by Dacre Montgomery. He comes off as the tough, mean, older brother character. Will's mother, Joyce, also gets a new boyfriend who is Bob Newby played by Sean Astin. His character is well-known as the goofy guy. He wants to understand and know what happened the year before, but Joyce is hesitant to tell him at first because of how strange things sound. Another new character we are introduced to is Dr. Owens, who is the Department of Energy Scientist.
The creators of this new and exciting supernatural Netflix original series, AKA the Duffer Brothers, were very successful with creating a 1980's-like film using precise characterization, actors, directing, writing, and soundtrack.
The soundtrack for this film became the biggest TV soundtrack of the year since the series was released. Many people agree that the music created a story within the show. With artists such as Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein, Billy Hargrove, and Murray Bauman, the Stranger Things vibes became powerful. In the series, there is a mixture of metal, classic jazz, and hardcore punk that seem to play at different scenes in order to create a strong effect on the story. As the Upside Down emerges to the screen, tense and mysterious music begin to chime in on the action.
The cast and crew for this show is absolutely phenomenal. While the series skips around and shows what the other characters are up to and what's going on whilst still connecting the plot together, you can really feel and grow a personal connection with each character on the screen; no matter how different each one is from the other.
When the young boys, Will (Noah Schnapp), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), are displayed on the show, it is obvious to see that they are just your typical middle school geeks; and they play their role precisely. Things begin to change when strange things begin to happen to Will though. Throughout the show you can see the shift between playful to maturity develop as they become desperate to help their friend out, and begin to understand the dark secrets in the town of Hawkins.
When Millie Bobby Brown is on screen, I can really see the distinct personality that is put together within her character Eleven. She has a tense, yet mysterious presence on the show, that makes you feel as if you need to know more about her devastating past. Another character that I felt brought the show together was Chief Hopper played by David Harbour. In the beginning, he comes off as a jerk. He acts as if he doesn't care about much, and as an extremely lazy chief; but as the show progresses, we learn that he actually does care and takes the problem very seriously. As Stranger Things 2 comes into play, we learn more secrets about him.
Stranger Things 2 also develops a love triangle surrounding a couple of teenage characters in the show. Watch the drama unfold in this new season, and stay tuned for the many new strange things that happen in Stranger Things 2!
I would highly recommend Stranger Things to anyone! This show is absolutely amazing, and I can't wait for more seasons to come."
1025,"I can see why everyone loves this show. I'm 58 and really liked it. Hard to pick a fave character. I initially thought Eleven was a boy. I like her, nancy, and dustin, sheriff and Max. Really loved the S2 finale. Can't wait for S3. Some of my other fave shows are Chuck, Smallville, Star Trek, Doctor Who, Timeless, Good Girls, This Is Us."
1026,"Season 1
There hasn't been anything good in this niche, maybe-sub-genre for a long time; classic, grown-up, suspenseful, children-cast sci-fi the likes of which are only to be found in the golden age of children literature in Europe. And this is just so good. The innocent, yet hard-reality, dark fringe of a story with beautifully done dichotomy of a warm familiar setting segueing into bizarre no-man's-land.Season 2
Is like Matrix 4, if the now-sisters continued that downward slope into cashing out on their franchise. The whole season 2 could have been done in the first 15 minutes of one episode of a spin-off. And even that shouldn't have been. If you are a tasteful fan of classic sci-fi's, and haven't seen the second season, you may want to skip this season all together. I cannot not see this failure now."
1027,"To be honest it's worth watching especially for younger viewers but OK for adults too. The effects are good but go over the top sometimes and the acting is alright for a mostly young cast, But the thing that lets it down is lack of suspense it hasn't got that can't wait for the next episode factor to it. Give it a go you might enjoy it .
P:S 
The girl who plays 11 will be a big star one day."
1028,"I would give season 1 almost 10, but its not perfect so its a solid 9.5. I really wish if the ratings for titles are per season rather than all seasons collectively. Each season should deserve its own ratings. Like many have stated, the 9.0 rating for Stranger Things comes from the season 1 ratings not so much for season 2.We all know season 1 was rock solid... its massively captivating, mystical, thrilling, adventurous and has decent amount of horror. The whole atmosphere, the story line and characters are all very well done. Life in Hawkins and all the general characters adds essence to the whole story. You get hooked in to the show on episode 1 itself.Season 2,... well, the big things about season 2 is that it answers some of the questions come across in season 1. I also think season 2 sets for future seasons by introducing more/new characters to the story which otherwise seems unnecessary (waste of time) for the season 2 itself... such as Max and Kali (08). But overall, the season 2 does not have the same intense of season 1 or the that captivation - not that its an easy thing to maintain through another season. Biggest fault for me was that most of the season 2 story is somewhat predictable unlike the season 1, and also the story line was not as connected as season 1. Saying all that, I still enjoyed season 2 other than couple of episodes... but overall its definitely not as same as season 1. If I rate season 2 I would give it a 7.5 or so.Just hopes season 3 will be as good as season 1. Overall, good work by Duffer brothers !!!"
1029,"I'll admit it took me until episode three of the first season to get into this show, 
but after that I gorged on it whenever I had the time. There's not much that I can say about Stranger Things that hasn't already been said. I watch a lot of TV and a lot of movies; and being a crew member in the industry for more than a quarter century I've seen both sides have good and bad years. The accolades and awards are well deserved for Netflix and the performers and artists of Stranger Things. This is TV's ""Golden Age"" and I'm glad to be a part of it - even if only as a loyal viewer. Stranger Things is one of the better shows on TV today...and that list is getting bigger (I encourage readers to check out some ""Nordic Noir"" for more exceptional TV).I will echo the words of those who spoke about the 80's nostalgia. Coming of age during the 1980's, I could relate to a lot of the more personal situations our protagonists were dealing with; relationships, school, bullies...I think most of us geeks out there had some flashbacks while watching....both good and bad.There are so many references and little inside jokes and homages throughout the first two seasons it's worth re-watching the entire series just to look for things in the background; or to listen really close to some of the dialogue. You may be pleasantly surprised at what you missed.Brilliant writing, well researched and thought-out production design, and acting worthy of an encore of one, perhaps two more seasons."
1030,"Well I'm also a 17 years old boy and I'm truly obsessed with this show... i have no words its like I'm living in the past 80s when watching this .. all the characters,music is very well done i dunno why i cant wait for another season so I'm re watching the episodes. keep up the good work :)"
1031,"This is a very enjoyable TV show, especially if you remember the 80's. The acting is great and the production values are very high. The show does feel like an extended Spielberg film and is very well put together.On the downside both series have been very similar in terms of story and it is hoped that series 3 will shake things up a bit and come to an enjoyable conclusion.On the whole, it's well worth a watch just don't expect much difference between series 1 & 2."
1032,"Netflix is shoving this down the throats of users by displaying this garbage on the main screen. They show a very displeasing figure on the screen, which would give heart attack to people. Kids cannot and I repeat, cannot watch this type of image. It will leave them with a scar in their mind. very very very bad"
1033,"Season 1 sucks but if you want you can skip it and still be good I guess..its really bad s1
But you can try and cringe through it and once you get to s2 it's better
S3 i think was the most fun my gf and I loved it and had a good time..but s2 was really good too and I might just be remembering s3 better since just watched it"
1034,Bad acting bad writing bad homages stupid lore bad internal logic this show is all around bad and overrated and just not scary or interesting please cancel this garbage netflix
1035,"This show was dragged out and stretched to beyond breaking point! I binge watched (as you do) the new season and it was puffed out with stuff that is obviously setting up a third and fourth season but I'm past the point of caring now! The first season was great, highly enjoyable, but now it's a rehash with new characters that add nothing to moving forward, apart from Max and the doctor played by Paul Reiser. Max's brother was.totally pointless!!! I'm still baffled by his inclusion to be honest, as he brought NOTHING to the party apart from being a fantastically ridiculous cliché from the '80s! it was a nice throwback to Paul Reiser and probably the greatest sequel in the history of movies, Aliens, with some scenes and dialogue lifted word for word and move by move from the film, especially the 'Stay frosty' line said by the soldiers in the lair of the beasts. Even the demadogs were totally xenomorph-like in the way they moved and hurled themselves at glass and doors.Apart from that, the 'sister' inclusion with the bunch of old-timers (the mohican man firing the gun at the cops and screaming half-heatedly was awful!!!) and the mum scene in the house were dull.in fact, most of the scenes with Eleven really slowed down the whole show in my opinion, apart from when she met up with the rest of the team. But it was marked just how boring Eleven's scenes were ZZZZzzzzzzNot a patch on the first season, and this was just acting by numbers. very disappointed with this!"
1036,Actors are horrible story is horrible. All of the people who enjoy this show must have been a dropped as children.
1037,"Stranger Things follows a group of people within a small town who go looking for a young boy who has gone missing and ultimately realize that there's more to the mystery then they initially thought. Some of the mystery elements were pretty good, and I watched the first season because I was curious and mostly interested. It had it's moments of cool stuff, but that was maybe once every second episode. The show advertises itself as a horror, yet it fails to be scary. There was not a single moment at any point during season one did I feel even slightly unsettled or scared. It's more of a sci-mystery, but even then it's not that good. It lacks a substantial amount of originality, from the design of the monster to the presentation of the plot. Nothing about this show is special. Another thing is just the amount of flaws in the show. There were multiple points where I had several questions about how certain things happened. For example, at one point two characters are in the forest together. Let's call them 1 and 2 to avoid confusion. 1 finds something almost as soon as they get into the forest and calls out to 2, but he's nowhere in sight. So what, did 2 just sprint off in one direction? Did he put in earbuds and start listening to some heavy metal or something? Did he leave the forest? Then, 1 goes off somewhere on her own, 2 magically returns, not out of breath or anything (so he clearly didn't sprint off somewhere) and not wearing earbuds either, and he can suddenly hear 1 from a place totally opposite the forest. Again, no spoilers, but somehow 2 hears 1 from that place. And even if you try to argue that 2 has bad hearing, in an earlier episode he hears a scream loud and clear from the other side of that very same forest. It just doesn't make sense. Some of you will call this a nitpick, but it stood out so blatantly to me that I couldn't help but address it. And besides, I can only ignore so many nitpicks before it becomes a problem and I have to start docking points. The acting, please kill me, is awful. The children are horrendous. They're expressionless, character-less actors who have no talent. At one point two characters are arguing and one kid looks like he's about to fall asleep as he yells at the other character. That, or he's stoned out of his mind. Sure, he's underage, but that doesn't seem to stop kids. On top of that, Winona Ryder attempts to pull off the insane mother role, and it's clear that she's trying to be great, but she's not. I don't think Winona Ryder isn't talented, but she didn't pull off the performance she seemed to be trying to. Everyone else was pretty flat too, at least if they were important they were. The characters these actors portray are even worse. They're unbelievably flat and boring. Each one can easily be described in a single sentence. The show tries to make it look like it came out in the 80s, but its gets to be annoying with how hard it tries. It shoves all this 80s crap into every scene, and it feels like the Duffer Brothers are ramming all their 80s computers down our throats and movie posters up our butts. I think the conversation the Duffers had before the show was in their attic, surrounded by the stuff of their youth, and started like this: ""Hey bro, what should we do with all this stuff from the 80s?"" ""Let's make a TV show"" ""Oh yeah, that's a great idea. But how will we get someone to produce it?"" ""Oh, we can just get Netflix to do it. They'll eat up anything, so long as they can make a couple bucks. Quantity over quality, like they always say"" Furthermore, the 80s thing sacrifices a level of quality even. The first thing was a personal issue, not an actual flaw really. This is though. The CGI is awful. Painful even. Now I know, ""It's trying to look like it was made in the 80s"" but I don't care. The show proves that it knows what practical effects are, and whenever it decides to use those it looks great. But I can think of only a handful of times where it actually did that. So why didn't it use practical effects all the time? I don't know. It's stupid, though, that's for sure. And the writing, oh boy. It ranged from okay to awful to flat out not making sense. And what's funny is that I think some of the actors knew that, specifically the main child actor. His delivery was so bad sometimes I wondered if it was on purpose. Like he knew that the writing was awful and was pushing the limits as much as he could to see how poorly he could act without the director noticing. Just for fun, I guess. One more big flaw: the soundtrack. It switches between this repetitive, boring, and frankly annoying sound/noise and ill-suited songs. Seriously, none of the songs have any place in the show. At least not at the points they were used. Overall Stranger Things sucks. Yet like I said, it was, for the most part, good enough to keep me watching it until the end. Will I watch the other seasons if there are more? Not a chance. At gun point, maybe. But not of my own free will. I don't get why people love this show so much, but if you do then go right ahead. Obviously I'm either missing something or I'm just not as easily impressed as most people or something. I don't know, but I don't really care. In the end I would not recommend this show."
1038,"Each season and episode are amazing.
Each actor acting in this series whether it be of any age will surprise you with their acting skills.
My personal favourite.(ever)"
1039,"Another awesome series by Netfix.
Really obsessed with the show"
1040,I love everything about the series. However Byler needs to happen in season 4. Amazing acting. In my opinion season 3 is the best.
1041,I couldn't even get past the pilot... I think I made it about 20 mins in and turned it off cause I was BORED AF.
1042,"The first season was awesome! But Netflix really outdid themselves with season two! Season two was by far the best! Stranger Things is a great show, we were hooked from the beginning! The actors are great, they ALL did a fantastic job. Season two was well worth the wait! All the action was awesome and it was just fun to watch, and definitely suspenseful. I have been recommending this show to basically everyone I know. Stranger Things is so well made and I enjoyed watching it."
1043,"I liked the first season very much! Its got suspense, originality, atmosphere, plot, interesting characters, things that keep you coming back for more.Unfortunately the second season came short. I was expecting much more from the writers that's for sure and they failed to deliver a sequel worthy of the first season's story.One would expect to see a better character development, an original follow up story, smarter dialogues and new characters that would feel meaningful, and why not add more plot to the whole story. Unfortunately none of those things come with the second season. The main characters didn't really evolve, maybe with only one exception and the outcome wasn't that interesting, the new characters are blunt and indifferent, the story made me yawn a lot, the dark atmosphere was there but it wasn't enough to keep me on my toes, plot has probably gone to another show, and oh well although i did finish the season, now that i did, i wouldn't mind if i did not.Definitely watch the first season, but have lower expectations from the second one. Seven stars for the shake of the first season."
1044,"I usually get bored with a series after the 4th or 5th episode, but Stranger Things kept me straight through to the end. If anyone remembers the first Phantasm, this will take you back to the thrill and excitement you had when you were a kid. First, the music track was spot on. I can't say enough about how they created a mood. The use of classic synths is what brought us back to the late 70's and early 80's. Nailed it! Story never became corny, even with a few corny kids. Added to the realism of how dorky we were at that age. Eleven, the main character, was brilliant acting. I cannot wait until the next series. I hope it is as fantastic as this one. I am sure it will be, if they keep the lineup. Fantastic job guys!"
1045,"Nicely paced show. The build up is a bit of a slow burn with great character development and an excellent cast. This is refreshing in that this series does not try to scare you every five minutes like a lot of things out now. The show, instead, exudes a subtle dark undercurrent dread and things unseen.If you were a kid in the 80's you will appreciate the choice of music, the clash and joy division tracks just seem to fit so well. Stranger Things gives off a Stephen King/Spielberg vibe from the get-go and is a love letter to the 80's. I'm not sure it breaks any new ground, but what it does, it does very well. The only thing I did not care for is that the ""bad guys"" are a bit one dimensional. The rest of the cast more than makes up for this shortcoming. Winona Ryder is great, the cast of kids, top notch. Netflix continues to crank out quality stuff."
1046,"I recently watched seasons 1 &2. I finished season 3 today and I have to say it was amazing. Each season is better than the last and they just add to the story each time. It's heartwrenching, exciting and action packed. All the kids are incredible actors. Millie Bobby Brown and Finn Wolfhard are excellent and make a good team. David Harbour and Winona Ryder are amazing in it too. Start watching today, you won't be disappointed!"
1047,"The plot was interesting enough to finish the series but it was too often tedious and focused on adolescent drama that is better suited for the preteen crowd. I would rather have watched this in a denser and more focused 90 minute movie. I found myself wanting to fast forward many times, and I often did. There is a fine line between drama/suspense and just bad writing/clichés. This show often dances on that line. As far as the acting goes, I think everyone did a good job, but Winona wasn't a great fit for the role. Her celebrity made the show focus a little too much on her character at times and she came across annoyingly crazy for the first half of the series. She has a lot of energy and a very specific voice, maybe its just me, but while she is talented, I'm just not sure she was a good fit. Overall, I think it had a good plot, good actors, but the writing was off, and the directing tried to make up for it but didn't quite work. I don't understand all the rave reviews. Everyone I know watched the entire series, but as I said, most of us were on the fence between tedium and curiosity. Not as satisfying as it could have been. Definitely got the feeling they were struggling to stretch it out over 8 episodes."
1048,"Like most of Hollywood these days, they need to inject political correctness and some leftist message into their shows and films. I thought ST was immune to this as it was just a good time and was done well. Later in the second season, for example, they just had to put a girl into the mix. Guess what then? She just has to be the love interest of the black kid. In reality this would not have gone over too well in a small town, and esp. in the 80's. To make her a red head was really funny as this fits into the stereotype of the black male fantasy even more. How the brothers were indoctrinated into this kind of PC culture crap is beyond me but it's a massive let-down nonetheless. I can't wait for the next version which will be set in the 90's and be all female cast!"
1049,I didn't think this series would be a great one . And one of the best TV -14 rated series .
1050,This is the best series i ever. I really recommend you watch it .its your worth your time
1051,"Keeps you hooked to the screen. Amazed me with the brilliant story, screenplay and acting. The first season was superb but then just like the other, this series dies"
1052,"What can I say?If you love E.T., The Goonies, Firestarter, IT, The Thing, and lived part of your life in the 80's, this show feels like a comfortably broken in boot. The look, feel, and style of this show will constantly hit you with nostalgia and that warm fuzzy feeling you get when everything in a house is a different shade of brown. It takes a BIG chunk of the stories of the above mentioned movies/books but combines them in a way that keeps things interesting without seeming TOO familiar or plagiarized (most of the time), the main exception being Eleven who is pretty much a copy paste of Charlene ""Charlie"" McGee from Steven King's book/movie Firestarter (with the addition of a few new powers). Well worth the 8 hour viewing time, can't wait for more, the next year is going to be a long one."
1053,"Another drawn out never ending series...Everything about it is predictable.Where have the single episode jolting series gone?Having to invest hours upon hours to find out how a show ends(if ever) is getting very old.I've decided to pull the plug after the 2nd episode instead of losing interest halfway through the season like so many others of the same format.The word ""bindge"" in front of any word usually implies a negative thing and its no different with ""bindge watching"""
1054,"So I grew up in the 90's with transformers, robocop, Star Wars, Goonies, Back to the Future etc.There as something special about that time and Stranger Things have captured it.I am late to the party starting watching it in 2020 but boy I was I for a ride.The characters are great, the storey is fab and all 3 seasons are great. I see lots of negative season 3 reviews but I thought S3 was almost as good as the first two.Best thing I've seen on TV for a very long time.If you like labyrinth, ET, poltergeist etc you're going to love this!"
1055,"I could care less how many cigarettes they smoke, or how many ads there are. It took two episodes to get moving, but season 3 was absolutely perfect. People are nit picking all these minor things. It's a SCIENCE FICTION show , it requires suspension of reality! Watching these kids grow up was a pleasure, they couldn't stay young forever, it had the right Amount of closure, while still keeping the door cracked 3 inches . Bravo!"
1056,"This show is considered to be sci-fi and entertainment show at the first place , which he had done so good so far , it doesn't need to explain everydetail or be so logical .but i admit that sometimes it went too far but as far as i am considered the show was really entertaining at most moment, has really good and attractive drama and romance and absolutely amazing sound tracks ...."
1057,I was just amazed to see the acting of David Harbour in the whole series. Hats off to him. And feel sorry as well because of that ending part. They could have ended better in season 3.
1058,When i watched firstly I dont like but then after i adopted the serials It is just amqzing Kids actors and actresss is amazing All the casting and their performances are absolutely perfect Love from Azerbiijan🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿
1059,"It's one of my best shows ever!!!!! You will enjoy watching every episode. -I don't really like science fiction shows, but this is so freaking different-"
1060,This movie is amazing and it has great cast especially milly brown.She is a fantastic actress.
1061,"In the hands of its Directors, The Duffer Brothers, Stranger Things is at turns touching (when it explores teenage love and friendship) and harrowing (when it follows the creature that turns out to be terrorizing the town).
The most amazing web series ever made!the music,the acting,the intro theme,the story-line everything was perfectly amazing!the story was complex yet showcased simple amazing!the whole season 1 every episode was engaging and right from the 1st episode i was into it from then on it was marvelous ride!the 1980's themed timeline was amazingly showcased and visuals were amazing!overall A must watch,Masterpiece!"
1062,The first few episode was kind of slow but essential for the built! I can't wait for the coming 4th season!!!!
1063,If you want to experience some new story then must watch it. It's my all time favorite series ever.
1064,"I love this serie , i can't wait for the season 4 ."
1065,"1 of the best tv shows ever made, for sure the best child cast ever!! Nothing negative to say absolutely nothing!!!"
1066,"I never grew up in the '80s yet I felt so much memories coming back I forgot I had. Stranger Things season 1 is a masterpiece. It's ""to much of a good thing"". I could barely watch season to and I had to watch the ending first because I got annoyed that Mike didn't know El was alive but that's just a personal problem. Season 2 is amazing. I loved Hopper and El's father daughter relationship. I'm I the only one that actually likes the plot of the Russians. I mean the show is called Stranger Things. I mean season 1 is better and nothing can beat it but season 3 is pretty great. I just wish Will was more of a main character. I thought he was going to be the main character until El showed up. Overall this show is a 10/10. Like I said season 1 is to much of a good for this rating not to be a 10/10"
1067,Very good This series. Max the best characters. Now the third season is my favorite
1068,Season one was fresh and intersting. In my opion it should have been a mini-series. All other seasons apart season 1 are just repetitive and boring. One trick pony at best.
1069,"Season 1 monster kidnapp's child
Season 2 now there is thousands of monsters.
Season 3 hahahah gothem!! THE monsters/monster is Still here.
Season 4 pretty much the samething. (Probably)"
1070,"What started off as good is now turned into overdone 1980s nostalgia. I watched the first season with great enthusiasm. Then came the second season. I'll let you watch this and make your own opinion. It had plenty of plot holes, and the kid with the mullet need some acting lessons. I was unaware that in 1984, small-town , Indiana they had interracial dating and it was it so widely accepted. If you're going to do a show that takes place in the 80s, keep it somewhat on the level, especially when it comes to Hicktown, USA. This can only mean that the third season is going to be nothing but an over-infestation of 80s nostalgia 3x."
1071,"I don't know what happened, the first season was outstanding, the creepy music, the callbacks to the 1980s, the scary monsters, it all came together. The second season, not so much. The kids are too young to be competing for a girl, and of course she's smarter and faster than any of them because she's a girl she can't possibly be slower and less talented than any of the boys because that would be anti-women. AND she rides a skateboard on top of that, the only girl in the country in 1984 to ride a skateboard. I lived through that time, no girls rode skateboards, and you didn't see girls in video arcades. I just left a review for The Mist where this liberal agenda of diversity and tolerance and sexual equality had basically polluted the show from the very beginning, and it's a shame to see it happening to Stranger Things. Craig Robinson's new buddy show on Fox is the same way. Is all of this a reaction to Trump's presidency?"
1072,"Much as I loved season 1, I began to hate season 2. The latter is more sprawling than the demogorgon tunnel which infests Hawkins. In season 2, irritating or violent or both type of characters are introduced, in my opinion just to plump up the story line to 9 episodes that in reality add nothing to the story. In fact the story arcs seem shallow and over the place. The introduction of Max and her troubled family, the total and unnecessary whole episode of Eleven's sister ( and bad acting), the treatment of Hawkins laboratory guards and scientist as easy fodder etc. Even the kids swear more profusely than season 1 (the first episode of season 2 mainly, probably was restrained in later episodes), the lame love story involving Nancy and Steve got even lamer and the parents of the kids with the sole exception of Joyce are shown as totally inept and bored. The characters have evolved into a single dimensional cardboard characters What I liked could have easily been screened into 4 episodes and that is mainly the story lines of Joyce, Jim Hopper, and the four main children protagonists and eleven. I think I will skip season 3"
1073,"Stranger Things is the decade's ultimate 80s love-letter, and an innovator for internet television. And where better to release the show than on Netflix, the world's fastest- growing streaming service? Stranger Things is not only a memorable chapter for the 'Golden Age of Television' but also another great addition to Netflix's ever-expanding library of original productions. Alongside Daredevil, 13 Reasons Why, House of Cards, Orange is the New Black and the relaunch of Black Mirror; Stranger Things is another great addition to the streaming service/network.Stranger is everything you'd want from an 80s-set TV show: Spielberg-homages, Star Wars references, parallels to Xmen, conspiracy theories, and an adventure about childhood: filled with bicycles, mystery and realising what it takes to grow up.Stranger Things is simple yet fantastic. Small scale yet ambitious. Everything is done so well here. Definitely worth the monthly subscription to Netflix alone. Watch it now when you have the chance! Before Season 2 premieres this year!"
1074,"The story line is gripping from the start, this is not a series i would have normally watched but my husband loves sci-fi. Well worth watching, it is a well-balanced series where the viewer can relate to the characters and it has just the right amount of weird. The story is based around the search for a missing boy, the boys friends and relatives start searching and all start to realise that something unusual and unexplained is the cause of the boys disappearance. The boys friends get the help of a young girl who arrived in town the same time as the boys disappearance, as her story unravels the boys start to realise they have much to learn and vow to find their friend. The plot takes many twists and turns."
1075,"Being a fan of things 80's related and sci-fi, this seemed like a no brainer for me to watch. While the 3rd season imo seemed to be the weakest in the series, it was still decent. Whenever the 4th series comes out I'll be sure to check in.Basically the first series revolves around a number of unusual occurrences in a small town most notably that of a missing boy, Will Byers. All sorts of paranormal events follow. All the kids are very talented/good actors.I really dug the 80's style and looks. I remember the first house I grew up had furniture that looked like the Byers household down to the tee. The nostalgia of it all was a plus for me as well."
1076,First season is an excellenly executed horror bursting with 80s nostalgia. Second and third seasons are consecutively worse do-overs and aren't worth most people's time.
1077,"Great characters a fun story. I binged watched the whole series as soon as it was released. Cool soundtrack too.. With its purely cinematic handling of its trip back to 80s sci-fi mystery and horror, Season 1 kicks off this phenomenon with great characters and moments of strong emotional grounding."
1078,"It's not so much a sci-fi, parallel space-time, alien monster movie full of homage, as a story of childishness and trust. Three little boys, plus a special girl, are so cute, especially after wearing a golden wig,. Children are always more innocent, pure and full of courage than adults."
1079,"I can't remember a tv series I've ever enjoyed as much as I have stranger things, the cast, plot, theme.. everything is genuinely breathtakingly perfect. The first season is my personal favourite but overall each season has its own unique twist and plot that gets you invested incredibly. If you've not watched it, please do, because you won't be left disappointed. The excitement I have for season four isn't like any other I've had for a tv series or even film. Thank you duffer brothers for creating such a masterpiece."
1080,"A very intriguing and we can call a thriller series which will keep you holding till the last episode.
An intresting thing is you need not need to wait for seasons to know what exact was the suspense.
Each season have own complete story."
1081,Lovely 💘 I can't wait season 4💔💔 I think I will rewatched again 😔😔
1082,"Our favourite series is Stranger Things. The directors are the Duffer Brothers. The lead actors are Millie Bobby Brown, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, and Sadie Sink.
Stranger Things is a mystery series for teenagers and adults.
The best things are the cast, the sound, and the series location. The only problem is the special effects, sometimes they look strange.
From our point of view, Stranger Things is a very good series. 10/10
Paula, Noa, and Lucía."
1083,"Stranger thing is a series that convein the whole family, small as well as large. stranger thing takes place in 80 année in hawkins in texas. their is history of a city in turmoil for the missing of Will a kids and this event will cause the veriter on a great government secret. Mike,Lucas and Dustin are almost everything to find their friend.
their are 3 seasons of 10 episodes. their is series of fantastique"
1084,Excellent story. Enjoyed each and every episode. Great work Duffer Brothers.
1085,"The suspense really does keep you hanging on the edge of your seat, and though I have heard some people say they found the first episodes of season 1 'boring' or have said that 'nothing happens' in these episodes, it's well worth taking the time to watch these episodes and at least reaching the season 1 finale until making a judgement.
I, myself was convinced that I would never watch anything of the sort, but everyone now knows that Stranger Things has quickly turned into one of my all-time favourite TV shows!
The characters are so relatable, and it really does keep you hanging on your seat, longing to know more.
A fantastically made TV show - if I'm totally honest, as Stranger things is a Netflix original, I hadn't initially thought that it could be quite as well made as 'proper' or 'independent' groups, however I am extremely surprised as to how wrong I turned out to be! I certainly won't hold back now when I see a Netflix original that looks up my street!
Although some sites (eg. Google) list Stranger Things as 'horror', I really would like to amend that. The TV show is a mix of Sci-Fi, Mystery and Thriller - perhaps 5 minutes or so out of the entire 3 seasons so far is Horror.
So many people will look at the poster and assume that Stranger Things is targeted at mainly young adults and teenagers. How wrong they are - I am a 17 year old girl, but have managed to get my mum, who is closer to 50, to watch Stranger Things, and at every single season finale, she has been just as excited as me to see what happens next! She swore on her life that she would never watch a Sci-Fi, Thriller, Mystery, TV show. However, After an extremely long period of nagging and trying to persuade her to watch it, my mum finally got just as enthralled in the drama as me! It just goes to show, that no matter what age, Stranger Things does make for a great hour of quality entertainment that leaves you literally hanging on the edge of your seat!
In conclusion, there's something for everyone. Perhaps for my mum, it was the appeal of the retro 80s setting that meant it was relatable for her. Perhaps for me it is the brilliant actors that make the TV show a rare gem of brilliantly high quality entertainment. For my friends, it is the Sci-Fi suspense that always leaves them wanting more.
What will it be for you?"
1086,Didnt know about it until Dead by Daylight brought the Stranger Things DLC into game and now its the best serie ive watched so far. Already excited for the season 4. *-*
1087,Once every now and again a show comes along that people just get and a few people just don't. Stranger Things is up there with X Files not in that it's a similar plot but that when it started some people got it others didn't. What can't be disputed is the impact X Files had I predict people will look back at Stranger Things in the same way.
1088,"When I first started watching this, I thought it was way too dark, but then I gave it another shot and fell in love.The series is filled with great references to classic movies that make up the core of great television. Stranger Things is filled with many good twists and great mystery's. It has a great Stephan King, Steven Spielberg's feel to it making the series an absolute must see. The humor throughout the entire show is a perfect touch to help lighten the mood, as its mixed in with some dark horror. I love that the show is set in the 80's, bringing back the memory of all those great 80's movies while creating a great atmosphere. There's also a perfect x-men vibe to the series to make it even better, creating the illusion of the comic book fact that ""Anything can happen""."
1089,"Between this, witcher, the boys and mpre this is amazing"
1090,"SI-7 stars
SII-8 stars
SIII-5 stars
Season III is disappointed"
1091,"An interesting story that keeps you in suspense. There are no stupid dialogs. Series are not tightened,constantly something is happening. The actors played well.The main minus is too many positive personages.The TV series lacks rigidity and an interesting villain.
1 season-10/10
2 season-7/10
3 season-7/10"
1092,Character Development is too good..It also offers a love story to which you get strongly connected. Every season offers you something different.
1093,"I used to hate this show at first because all the characters do is quarrel, scream, etc. This show is about the disappearance of a kid and the citizens of the town must find him. I do like the 80's references, that's good. This feels like The Goonies meets Gravity Falls for obvious reasons. This is a pretty decent show. 7/10"
1094,"Series 1 great, Series 2 good, Series 3 very good, but with each series the characters grow older and change a bit, new ones come in, plots evolve. No Series is perfect but this one tries to evolve which is a brave move and in the main the mostly succeed. The 80's backdrop is really well handled, particularly the music and fashion. Probably one of the best broad spectrum sci fi, mystery, whodunnit series ever, actually appealing to ages from 14 to 60, as it goes on how it handles the kids getting older will be fascinating."
1095,"Very excited .. And the story very nice
I will wait for season three"
1096,"One Of The Best Series Of The Century.
A Must Watch!"
1097,"I absolutely love this show, but there is just so much cussing and screaming.
I know it's a lack of maturity, but the directors could control this if they wanted. I personally just think it's tacky and a lack of acting talent. I hope this changes in season 3.
A little off topic - The best kid actor is Will. Everyone thinks it's 11, but in my opinion she's a close second."
1098,"""STRANGER THINGS'' for now is one of my favorite TV show, there is happening a lot of mystery, stress, romance and fantasy.Netflix is definitely inspiring a lot of people for now.Their actors + ideas = the greatest combo.I watched all 2 seasons and now I'm waiting 4th July, because then will come ''STRANGER THINGS'' 3rd season.Thanks for : Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer."
1099,"If you are in 2019, and don't know what is Stranger Things... well, shame on you!
It's a brilliant work that shows that netflix has come to stay!"
1100,"I do not know how to describe this series very well ... I only know it's the best I've ever seen! Stranger Things not only shows the importance of friendship but also shows the power and disposition that someone can do to save a beloved person.
Will, a young boy who has many friends and a family who loves him very much, on a day like everyone else, was cycling back to his home alone. But on the way, he finds a mysterious figure who pursues him. The boy disappears, causing a series of mysteries and dangers to Hawkins, Indiana. His parents and friends do absolutely everything to find him, and they discover that he did not die, but he was not in the same world as them ... and yes, in a parallel world.
For this series I give 9.9 out of 10. For a single reason ... it takes too long to get new seasons. That's right, I'm taking 0.1 because the show is so good I can not wait! I NEED SEASON 3 !!!!"
1101,"I watched this show bcoz it's kinda popular among the 9gag community, the reason why I also watched Game of Thrones. I expected a quality show just like GoT but boy..I was completely wrong. I'm an 80s kid so I'm familiar with all the reference from that period. But a nostalgic feeling isn't enough to save this show. First of all..Wynona Rider acting is just awful. And the story goes from interesting to confusing. It's like they struggle to place bits and pieces and also to explain what's really happening. Not to mention that this show is trying too hard to be PC. I watched season 2 hoping it'll get better. It didn't. This is just a below par show and it's really overhyped.."
1102,"When this series was first released last year, people couldn't get enough of it. The 80s setting, with loads of nostalgic hints to films to that decade such as The Goonies and IT. The Duffer Brothers clearly went to great lengths to make the verisimilitude of the 80s aesthetic credible.While the story is hardly original, it's shown to us in a way that makes it stand out. The acting is incredible, particularly from the child actors (which is a rare statement from me) Millie Bobby Brown's portrayal as Eleven is phenomenal and while her whole fish-out-of-water story is a bit by the numbers, her chemistry with the younger characters is great and they work off one another really well.The high school romance tropes come forth with the teenage characters, with elements of grief, survivor's guilt and uncertainty. A love triangle of sorts takes place, while the main story of searching for the missing boy goes underway.Winona Ryder and David Harbour are on top form as the adult leads, with the determination and strength of their characters carrying through.The first series wowed the majority of us, and rightly so, and the second series does more or less the same thing, with the various aspects of the show being delved into deeper and the majority of the characters get more development. The 'Upside Down' proves to be a bigger threat than the characters first thought, and the expanded mystery and intrigue succeeds in sucking the viewer in even more.In conclusion, the series is a fond appreciation of the style of the 80s and the horror/thriller genre. The characters are very charming and it brings you in for the ride, for lack of a better expression.Definitely worth a watch."
1103,"when i first heard of the show i had almost no interest in the show when it got released. But when people were talking about the show's second season i decided that since everyone was talking about it why not join them and i'm very glad that i made this decision.it has a great story, appreciate the pop culture references and the practical effects on the monster, also i loved the acting that was put into the child actors, i mean one of the child actors Finn Wolfhard is going to be in Stephen King's IT movie. But what i think this show is a game changer to the science fiction genre of TV"
1104,"For someone like me that loved all those weird VHS movies on the shelves of the local video store, who knew about movies that nobody else had ever heard of, this show is the bomb! It has everything, teen morality, cool but geeky kids and a great sci-fi mystery. Love the sets, love the actors, love the music, I even love the opening credits!"
1105,"A reprise staged with ambiance, fiefdom of classical 80's hits like E.T., X-Files and The Exorcist, this show is a time traveler for fans who love the 80's and want to see a reboot from best of both worlds.Though I've followed GOT, Walking Dead, Dexter, Supernatural, Sense8, X-Files, Twin Peaks and some of the best series out there, I rarely write reviews, but this one is an exception.It brings the best of everything that an 80's born would love to see. Winona Ryder justifies her role of a strong, persistent mother who wants to save her child from evil. And the Kids, yes they're portrayed like 80's kids, damn, you'd just want to give away everything to see their pure childish innocence, will, wit and clan.Makes you think; Did we miss the best of our generation and is it behind us and long gone, no, optimistically it's not gone."
1106,"Important thing for any series is,you should go to next episode eagerly. This is achieved by this series.You keep on asking questions and you next thing is you will get more questions. Within 10 minutes you will get hooked to this series.Pace of each episode is great and has only eight episodes.Viewer who like investigation and sci-fi and are new to this genre will like this series. But viewers who have watched already number of good sci-fi and horror series or movies Will find it old stuff. All the characters are well written and developed over the series.Only negative thing is that,the story is clichéd as you go towards the conclusion. Hope they work on the story for the second season. This series is especially for children. I could have given 8,but towards the conclusion has disappointed me."
1107,"I RARELY post any kind of reviews for TV shows or movies, and to be honest, most of the time I start watching a new show, I am disappointed. However, after watching the first season of ""Stranger Things"" I am more impressed with this show than I have been with any other for a very long time. The acting is believable, the music is, well, perfect, and the plot is very engaging. And on top of that, there was no nudity and the language is for the most part clean, which I personally appreciate. And of course, being a child of the 80's (and this show being set in that era), the creators/directors really do nail it in regards to that. Can't wait for season 2 ... c'mon, hurry up July 2017!"
1108,"I usually don't like the Science fiction type, but with all the hype around"" The Stranger Things""I decided to give it a try . And I wasn't disappointed, in fact I new by the 5/10 first minutes that I was going to look the whole season . The actors was so good, especially the kids , which usually are not so great in other TV shows ( Walking dead for instance ) The 80's era was totally there, even If I was born in the late 80's I could feel the atmosphere .The cool thing about that Show is that each episode are increasing in intensity as long as you are progressing .I didn't gave a 10 stars because , first the perfection doesn't exist ^^, and secondly because sometimes it felt a little bit too much cliché( I wouldn't say predictable )which make me fell feel that there was a little bit of lack of originality . Having said that, I got to tell that it's one of the best TV show that it was given me to watch, top ten for sure !"
1109,"I have recommended this show to all my friends. And most of them love it too. So much fun. I really miss the 80's. I was a little nerd myself. This was so exciting and fresh. It got me hooked after the first episode. Netflix and HBO are the kings of series. I thinks it's so awesome how big and good Netflix has become. They keep making excellent series. I also really love Narcos. That show too is really good. I am looking forward to season 2 of this show. I was so glad when I read that the season 2 was coming next year. To all the people that make this happened at Netflix, Thank You. You make my life better. And Thank You creators and actors of this show, for making me forget about all that is bad in life. Taking me with to this new world. This really is nothing short of a home run. Bravo! :)"
1110,"I read here and there some comments about this show and how great it is. This and ratings on IMDb mean nothing. Nowadays TV shows became so bad that even the biggest crap is glorified.The moment i started watching the show, seeing four boys are playing dungons and dragons, that gave me a smile and remembered me about my own childhood. But i was highly suspicious because of the black boy.I thought the moment they will glorify this black kid as especially brave, super talented or smarter then everyone else i will switch this thing off and forget about it. Because i am just sick of the political correctness bull where they always add some under laying social education to every show. The same i thought about overly heroic girls or any social justice non sens which may appear.But it never happened. The black kid was just a kid, the girl even when she had super powers was just a 12 year old girl and acted like one. Not only one social justice propaganda or even any cliché was seen in the whole series.To be honest, i binge watched it! :) It was brilliant. Just a good story, very well acted and the characters where just regular people. Enjoyable from the beginning to the end.And that's how you not suck at making a good TV show. Just stick by your story and spare us the social education."
1111,"Absolutely in love with this show. Halfway through it just felt like a childhood favorite, one I could just ease into watching and feel so, so comfortable. You can definitely feel its Spielberg influence, and yet it manages to stand out among all other TV shows right now. It's a great blend of coming-of-age childhood drama, comedy, horror, and fantasy. I don't think it's always perfect, but it has such simple, great characters. Out of all of the Netflix shows I've seen as well, it's perhaps the one with the biggest heart. Such a joy to watch, I did not want to keep progressing though the season because I did not want it to end."
1112,"So I am going to sound extremely knowledgeable here so that my review seems interesting AND I reach the minimum amount of words needed to post my review :P OK, that's the best I could do. meh!Well, not that big a fan of show's seeming to outdated, started off with minimum expectations, and bammmmm, there I was, totally sucked into it. The way they have given screen time to every character and allowed them to grow on their own, its amazing. You can't pick up a clear ""lead"" like in other shows, which is good. There are enough laughs and tears along the way, you get attached with the characters, I loved the kids, specially Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Eleven (Millie Brown) and Mike (Finn wolfhard) AND the rest of them for that matter. The story line is also very good, they don't waste your time like other show's who assume that they are going to go on forever and increase the episodes uselessly and irritatingly. And best part is that it doesn't leave you unsatisfied in the end, they give you a sort of closure, to please you and YET keep enough unanswered questions, so that you want more but can happily wait. This is how a TV Show should be made, sensible closure's for every seasons, and at the max 8/10 episodes per season. WATCH IT!"
1113,"This TV series is just brilliant. It contains bits from the insanity watched in Fringe, drama from Twin Peaks, the thriller from X-files and craziness from Goonies. The wardrobe, gadgets and environment are very consistent with the time-frame. Particularly, when regarding to the old walky talky, He-Man and Skeletor on the TV, a poster of Jaws (the first movie.Young actors are good and sometimes even better than adults. Some scenes might be considered a bit violent and classified as horror but it is pretty much soft. these rare scenes come and go fast as glimpses. Since I first watched the first episode became a fan. don't know about the season 2 but I'm waiting. Hope you watch and like it as I"
1114,"Yes it is full of 80's nostalgia, but that is not necessarily a bad thing at all. The cinematography is just amazing, the kids' performances are fantastic, the story is... well, the story is just OK. Considering that i'm writing this review with only first season aired, i believe some of the major flaws will be properly fixed for the next seasons. The show has a great potential, but DO NOT expect an ""10"" show, nor ever an ""9.1"". My eight is far generous, could be an 7.5 with honors. I recommend watching the first couple episodes, and if you're not hooked, don't waste any more time. It's a show for people who like an specific kind of sci-fi and are not too exigent."
1115,"What an amazing new series! I was getting tired of hearing about all these supposedly amazing TV shows, such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead and Breaking Bad that people always talk about, so when I heard there was a new entry to that list I said screw it, and jumped in, and boy was it great.At the beginning the show follows 5 different perspectives of the story, Mike and the gang, Joyce, Hopper, Nancy, and Jonathan. Even though there were a lot of characters I didn't struggle to remember any names, as I usually do. This isn't because they said their names a lot, but more because all of the characters felt like real people, they were believable.Later on the 5 perspectives change into 3, Mike and the gang, Nancy and Jonathan, and Hopper and Joyce. Each team are uncovering one piece of the puzzle, making it extremely satisfying when everyone teams up in the end, so that every character knows everything.Every writer nailed it, and every actor/actress did an extremely good job, so it is difficult to find flaws here, and I tried to ignore them, but the same one kept showing up.The biggest ""problem"" is that the CGI (special effects) -team was either too small for the job or didn't have a big enough budget to keep the quality consistent. I'll try keeping this spoiler free, but there is one scene with a knife and a big jump, where the special effects are just not believable and it really pulls you out of the experience. Hopefully you know what scene I'm talking about if you've seen the show. Now that I come to think of it this next part reminds me a lot of the situation the director of Jaws had when they were filming, which was that the shark didn't look very good, so they had to keep it off- screen for most of the film to not ruin it. It is very much the same with Stranger Things, because in fight scenes with the monster in the last episode the lights keep blinking a lot, not only did this save the CGI team a lot of work, but it also saved the viewers the feeling of this not being real. But there is nothing wrong with that, because they solved the problem, well the thing is that they sort of took it back, since in one of the last scenes with Eleven the monster simply doesn't look realistic enough.I would still be willing to give it a 10/10 if that was it, because everything else is just so well done, but the final small detail that made me go to a 9 was that the last episode had me thinking the episode was ending like 5 times. The final 4-6 scenes were directed in such a way that it always looked like the credits were about to come up, making me actually want the episode to end instead of the opposite.All in all, watch this show. I can actually guarantee you that you'll like it, if it was possible to give a 9.7 I would do that.Watch it."
1116,"I'm sure by now everyone knows about this show, so instead of writing the same stuff you've probably read already, I just want to focus on three things: 1. Yes, they did manage to give it an awesome '80s vibe, from the opening sequence to the end credits. Having grown up with these movies myself, I can attest to that. However, I think it will appeal to younger audiences as well. After all, there must be reasons that movies such as ""The Goonies"" and ""E.T."" remain memorable even now, other than the ""'80s vibe"". 2. The creators of the show (the Duffer brothers) have somewhat regretted having Winona Ryder's character acting so hysterically from the start. I disagree with that. That's EXACTLY how a real person would act if *spoiler* happened to her. I hate it when in most movies e.g. the hero loses someone very close to them, then they cry for a brief moment and then it's back to the action. That's ridiculous. 3. I liked how they gradually revealed pieces of the puzzle in every episode. No matter how clever your plot twist/secret is, if the building up period exceeds a certain point, then you'll have created too high expectations and it will be impossible to impress your viewers after that. I'm afraid that this will be a one off deal. I'm sure that the incredible success of the first season will lead to a second one, but given the plot and the ending, I doubt they'll be able to keep it to as high a level. In my honest opinion, the best case scenario would be if they wrote a similar story with a similar setting and maybe even have the same actors play different roles. I really, really wish they'll prove me wrong, but I'm afraid that a direct sequel is doomed to fail. Especially since this was supposed to be a one season show and they only discuss about making a second one because of all its unexpected success."
1117,"The Stranger Things is now one of the best shows out there, and has some fantastic special FX and story, and if you are from the 80s or earlier you will even like this show more.For me Stranger Things is a mixture between E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985), and Poltergeist (1982), also movies i love.If you want a TV Show that gives you back the 80s feeling when you were young then this TV show is for you, it's funny it's trilling it has action and it's creepy, you will never get bored with this first season, After each episode, you long for more episodes.It's just like seeing E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial (1982), The Goonies (1985), and Poltergeist (1982) for the first time.See it you will love it."
1118,"Okay, unless you are a millennial or younger, you can't help but notice the aesthetic allusions in Stranger Things to classic 80's works such as Altered States,E.T, Firestarter, Red Dawn, and Aliens. Not to mention borrowing thematic story elements from The X-files (including the theme music), as well as your choice of 80's teen angst drama. But the sum of the parts definitely adds up to a warm and cozy familiar feeling in this series not seen since those heady days when computer technology first impacted the culture en mass.In this review, I was going to warn of spoilers, but I have rescinded that idea because I am only going to talk about one story line that was completely unnecessary, misguided, and ultimately abandoned by the writers. What about Barbara? She is the second victim in this mystery, but she is given short shrift by the whole town, who are focused solely on finding/saving the young boy. By including that story line, and then essentially foregoing it, it really made the rest of the characters (save Nancy) seem morally duplicitous. Why even include it? I suppose there was only so much story to cram into 8 episodes, so something had to give, but it just should have been written out completely from the start."
1119,"This is one of the series you have to watch. It feels like an old movie from Spielberg like E.T. or has a touch of Super 8. We we're totally hooked from the first Episode and couldn't stop watching it. Finally something else on the TV.If you love 80's style and mystery you're gonna love this show. The kids are acting superb and the effects are gorgeous. It makes you feel like a kid again, you can feel the tension between friendship and the action you always wanted as a kid. It sucks you right into their lives and stories.Love it!"
1120,"This show is really great. It got my attention right away and I couldn't stop watching it, I finished the season in one day and cannot wait for the Duffer brothers to come up with season 2. The kids are really good actors and they sure do keep you gripped to the show.It's based in the 80s and was influenced by Steven Spielberg and Stephen King which I realized after watching a few episodes before I read it online. It has great soundtracks and really good cinematography shots.It's really cool how this Netflix series has gotten so much attention and great reviews. If you have not started watching, you definitely should get to it asap."
1121,"The return of my childhood. ET, The Goonies, Stand By Me, all in one show! There were so many flashbacks of these movies yet this show was completely original. I can't even find the words to write all of you this brilliant review because all i can say is the show takes hold of you and unlocks your past child, and enjoy the ride because in a hiccup your already finished with season 1.I've been waiting for a show like this yet did not know i was until it came out. I also loved 80's television and the adventures of the kids of the 80's, what an age to be a kid. From Chunk, Chris Chambers, and Elliot now comes Mike Wheeler. Make no mistake this is a show for those who love the 80's, the genre hits home.I cannot wait until season 2, tough part about Netflix is when you binge the wait feels so much longer. Thank you Netflix for hitting home on this, we all can agree on this."
1122,"This film is a love letter to fans of the genre. Absolutely a gem for all time. Once you start you cant STOP!!! Top Notch execution!I haven't seen a film that has kept my attention like this one has in a very long time. The story is so bold but yet flourishes with tenderness, it will literally make you feel every emotion imaginable like a harp being strummed from one end to the other. Don't miss out on a well executed film. It has surpassed so many of my expectations and has put many blockbuster films of the genre to shame. Take it from me it has made me and instant fanboy.Till Next Time!!"
1123,"The story takes place in 1983 Hawkins, Indiana. When a middle school boy named Will mysteriously vanishes his three best friends, mother, brother and a local police chief become engrossed in supernatural events in an attempt to find him. The plot for this movie feels like something out of a Stephen King novel. It seems like the show is self-aware its own influences too. There are references made to eighties sci-fi horror films all throughout the series (Evil Dead, The Thing). So this isn't the most original show ever made, and I admit if I was just going off of the plot description, I probably wouldn't have invested my time in it. But this series offers something pretty interesting. It isn't something completely new, but it takes previous works and blends them together to create a story and style of its own. Imagine the Goonies and Twin Peaks colliding with a John Hughes film and a Stephen King novel and getting dropped in the middle of The Twilight Zone's universe. That best describes Stranger Things. Its creativity comes from its ability to mix influences and that's why it clings on to you with in the first episode. It provides something that is familiar but ultimately gives us something new.Eighties nostalgia is alive and well and you can clearly see its influences in the today's art-work, whether it be music, film or fashion. The only problem I've ever had with eighties-influenced art is when the artist makes something that is outdated and clearly would only work if been made in the eighties. However, Stranger Things is different. It wouldn't work as well if it was made in the eighties. The modern visual effects, directing, and cinematography compliment the series beautifully and make it easier to immerse yourself in this type of art. The modernization of this story gives it a component of clarity. While if this was made in the eighties, it would have gotten buried because it would just be stamped as another clichéd sci-fi thriller. But today, it stands out as a uniquely stylized and beautifully composed masterpiece. But it isn't just the style and visuals that keep you engaged. The story line twists enough to always keeps you guessing, but never enough to alienate or confuse you (like an M. Night Shyamalan film). The acting is phenomenal. Wynona Rider showcases her incredible acting chops to their full extent. She gives an absolutely heartbreaking performance. While the young actors in this film show us that their inexperience never gets the better of them. They never get overshadowed by their seasoned co-stars. One of the most admirable things about this series is that is stays well-grounded even with all the ridiculously abnormal activity. The charters never seem over-the-top or clichéd. Everyone in the series stays relatable. The story never gets confusing or incoherent. The blend of CGI with the natural backgrounds never gets sloppy or excessive. The score compliments the style beautifully. It never exaggerates a scene but keeps us submerged in the story by providing a signature eeriness to each scene. Stranger Things is truly another one of Netflix's crowning achievements. I look forward to the seasons to come."
1124,"Stranger Things a most enjoyable 80s throw back. This series comprises a lot of elements that I personally love in movie making. The story was amazingly written and the cast was terrific. The two things that most count in making a hit. The story gels together nicely from episode to episode. The hook is well done at the end of every episode bringing you back for the next episode. The cast was awesome with every actor portrayal be great even the bit actors. I love the way elements from Steven Spielberg movies and elements form Stephen King books were brought together with the makers paying homage to both. The 1980s setting is so good and well done. I personally love 80s movies and having that feeling was fantastic, pure nostalgia. I miss movie making like this where storytelling and talented actor drive the film. Now it's rehash, reboot and special effects galore with no substance at all. Originality is out the window with just poor and lazy movie making.It feels like one long movie with a running time of just over 7 hrs with episodes being roughly 52 minutes long with others a little shorter. My only problem would be the slow pace in some episodes, the ones which are over 52 minutes. It could have been edited a little better by shortening the episodes to about 48 minutes.With every actor's performance being good from child actors to adult actors, good story telling and a 80s styling, Stranger Things is a great example of how movie making should be done. A strong nine out of ten, near flawless and I highly recommend it. I'm sure you won't be disappointed."
1125,"This is a show, where I can't really understand negative reviews. - Some write the acting was terrible/awful.. -> What? As an actor I can almost certainly guarantee you, that the acting was solid, if not outstanding (eleven) and if you didn't like it, it is probably because the person or their character is not appealing for you to watch. Also keep in mind, there were many takes and the ones that made it into the final product, are the ones the directors wanted, so blame them and not the actors. - Some write the plot was boring/simple/predictable and the story didn't really come to an end and didn't answer all questions. -> What? This is a Mystery show, if you answer all questions, whats mysterious about it? o0 Most of you don't seem to understand this business at all. You have to kind of bring the show to an end and leave some backdoors for possible more seasons if the show is a success. How do you think this is possible if not by how the creators of this show did it? Oh an the plot was boring/predictable, etc.? Well congratulations you probably have watched and/or read lots of scifi/mystery/thriller movies and books, because for me it was really entertaining and not predictable at all. And even if you figured what could happen next, it was still interesting to watch how the characters would react etc.To anyone giving this less than 6/10 this is just unfair. The acting is solid if not very good, the soundtrack is amazing, cinematography is outstanding, coloring is great, effects are very decent, how can you give this profession no credit? If you would give 1 point for every job that has been done well in this show, you cannot get less than 6/10 unless you rate only by your personal taste and that is a highly subjective rating and thus not really helpful/significant to other people."
1126,"This is a decent show that in my opinion unfortunately doesn't come nowhere near a 9 or a 10 that most people have given it .I'll try to keep it as short as possible and go with the pros first:1)The acting is very good and the kids did a nice job especially the girl playing Eleven and the boy playing Dustin.2)The general idea of the show is interesting (but ruined by some very stupid stuff,more on that in the cons)3)I liked the cinematography and the overall tone/atmosphere of the show4)The music/soundtrack is coolNow to the cons:1)The monster in the show is basically a walking rotting flower with teeth that comes from an evil dimension and it seems to be the sole inhabitant of that place.I could somehow get past the fact that it's alone but the way it looks really ruined the show for me.I can't believe that anybody in their right mind can give a green light for that look.2)The pace of the show is extremely slow and I feel like it could have easily been 4 episodes instead of 8.3)The stupidity of most of the characters is at an insane level:a)Jonathan and Nancy.This is basically their thinking: 'You know that creature that comes through walls and that took away 2 kids already? How about we take a gun and a baseball bat and go alone into the woods at night and kill it.' They basically attempted this 2 times(the 2nd time they even kind of know what they're dealing with which makes that attempt even more ridiculous).I'm sorry but I just couldn't believe that somebody would be that dumb and that also ruined the show for me.b)The sheriff broke into that facility once and got caught(and they just let him go but they immediately kill the burger dude in the diner for no reason whatsoever??),so he figured why not give it a second shot,f**k the cameras and the probably increased security,this time it's gotta work right? Stupid ,lazy screen writing that doesn't make any sense.c)Hey teacher excuse me for calling so late but how exactly do you make a sensory deprivation chamber?Say what?Why do I ask?It's just for an experiment .Oh it's for an experiment you say? Well if that's the case let me just explain this real quick to a 10 year old.You boys be safe,good night ;)I could go on and on but I'll just wrap it up by saying that this show was a bit of a disappointment for me.It had great potential and an interesting premise that was ruined by lazy writing and the worst looking monster I have ever laid eyes on.I'd compare this to Wayward Pines,a couple of interesting mysterious episodes but then it just went downhill.I'm giving it a 6.5-7 /10."
1127,"Honestly, I've never been a fan of science fiction, so I didn't think I was going to like it as much as everyone else does. But I'm pleasantly surprised. I mean, it's not the greatest show I've ever seen, but I watched the first season over two days and I can't wait for more. One of the best things about Stranger Things is the acting. I'm always impressed when kids can act because I know when I was a kid I would've been so over the top and dramatic, but for the most part these kids are total naturals, specifically Millie Brown and Gaten Matarazzo. They were better than some of the adults. The kids reminded me of a blend of The Goonies, Stand By Me, and Freaks & Geeks, which I really loved because it was great to see characters like that again and it just felt right for the story. My one complaint however was the swearing, especially in front of parents. I'm not sure why the media always has young kids swearing but that is so unrealistic to me. I never knew any kids that swore when I was that age. I'm not offended by swearing, it's just that it was a bit distracting because it felt like they were trying too hard. The relationship between the actors felt so real; you really believed they had grown up together and were the best of friends. There were only a couple actors that I felt shouldn't have been cast, but for the most part the cast was perfect. I couldn't believe how few roles so many of them have had, and yet they were so believable. From the very first episode you are completely hooked. The intro is so short and simple yet it's perfect. The music and graphics go so well together. It's not an opening credits that you feel like skipping. There was one scene when my jaw dropped and I knew instantly there was going to be so much to uncover. I loved the story lines and the nostalgic feeling I had when watching Stranger Things. A time before Internet and cell phones, when kids used their imagination and went on adventures. I grew up in the nineties and it's rare to find a show these days that doesn't rely heavily on being current. I was glad that there was hardly any sex in this show (I'm sounding like a complete prude, I know) because I think that will give it a chance for teens to watch it with their parents without it being awkward or too mature for younger viewers. This is the type of show we need right now. Just a good, suspenseful, mysterious drama to indulge in. It's the perfect blend of scifi and drama and I can't wait to find out what happens next season."
1128,"I'm mad I waited so long to watch this. It was sitting in my queue for the longest and I had no idea what I was denying myself. What a great cast, such a compelling and intriguingly woven tale. The music was so invoking yet non-invasive. That title graphic alone is brilliant. As an 80s baby the sounds and the visuals brought on some serious nostalgia. Goodness, I'm sure there's something wrong with this show, but there's so much good about it, I either didn't notice or it doesn't matter.Well, I guess the negative could be that it's ONLY 8 episodes long! Oy! Now I have to figure out what to do with myself. Here comes the binge crash.Good stuff! Good good stuff!"
1129,"There are few movies or television series that I would call flawless. Even vaunted shows like Breaking Bad have their dud episodes, casting misfires, or occasional plot holes.I'm not going to rewrite the other reviews, talking about the great story, the fun (but not in your face) homages to classic horror and suspense movies, or how it gets the 80's just right.What I want to talk about is the AMAZING performances turned in by every single actor and actress. Obviously well-written, and well-directed, but absolutely well-performed as well. Any one of the performances by the 4 middle-school-aged kids that lead the action would be among the best child performances I have ever seen. All 4 together, in the same series, is mind-blowing. The adult leads are all Emmy caliber. Winona Ryder is unbelievable. David Harbour gives such a subdued performance as a broken Police Chief, without descending into the melodramatic and clichéd. I know Modine's been working right along, but this is the first thing I've seen him in in years.. and I think it's his best work. Even the minor roles.. the teacher, the police officers, the parents, are right on point, creating a television universe where complete suspension of disbelief is nearly automatic.I watched this show thinking that the hidden hand of Stephen King must somehow be involved.. more than just an inspiration. Writing from a kid's perspective (and getting it right), a la ""The Body"", or ""It"", is a rare skill indeed.Don't miss ""Stranger Things""."
1130,"Its becoming a habit of the Netflix machine to churn out outstanding viewing! seemingly like all new shows the 1st series episode count is low only 8 episodes and leaves you wanting more, I hope more is what we get in the form of series 2! brilliant cast/acting/story line completely out of the norm! love the 80's settings and nostalgia! The Cast a mixture of unknown/faces you recognise but have no idea of their name and Winona Ryder (the only cast member I can genuinely remember the name of when I started watching) Ryders performance in this is outstanding worthy of awards same to be said of the Millie Bobby Brown the young girl who plays Ele(Eleven)"
1131,"(Non spoilers) So I haven't really had much experience with the horror & sci-fi genre mix but this season was absolutely stunning. The flashbacks were smooth and perfectly timed packing even more feels to each scene. The quirky geek squad were sometimes predictable with their actions but they brought comedy and a separate theme of friendship to this TV series that made it just that more amazing. When I saw the 9.2 rating on IMDb (I think its going down slowly though) I was skeptical about a horror & sci-fi combo TV series getting this high of a score but after watching the entire season I happily will give this TV series a 9/10.(Spoilers) The only reason why it doesn't get a 10/10 is because although it starts with a violent shocking moment early on (where the shopkeeper gets shot), I never had that true feeling of unpredictability where you don't know who is going to die and at what moment. Another thing that they could of done is build up a back story more for Barbra and maybe used the other rude jocks (not Steve) a bit more.However all in all this an AMAZING T-V series and I strongly hope that they make a second season and that if they do that it will be as incredibly structured and just... ...damn good as this one was."
1132,"Our collective/condensed memories of the 80's. The Goonies, ET, Stand By me, and The Thing ""COULD"" have been ""Stranger Things""......IF Doc Brown had swapped a VHS copy of JJ Abraham's SUPER 8 into Marty's coat pocket instead of that Almanac!! ..and, as a result? ALL of our cherished 80's movies memories actually WERE like Stranger Things! Never - in the history of cinema/TV/subscription-bit-rate-bandwidth - have I seen ""child actors"" so perfectly found, rounded-up together, cast, and directed so fluidly, with that ""innocent essence"" we all still love and remember about the films of the 1980's! ..Bravo!"
1133,"What seemed like a mere 80s throwback from the looks of it, Stranger Things is much more like a homage to that period.Drilled down to its bare, this is a story about a mother's search for her lost child and the finesse with which its crafted among elements of mystery and sci-fi makes it highly intriguing. The cast does justice to their roles especially the protagonists who have given a truly believable performance. The background score is chosen to perfection and amplifies the retro feel of the show. Stranger things wont be breaking your scare meter but it will take control over you and keep you engaged till the very end."
1134,"Love that show. Love the intro music. Very 1980's. It has suspense, a good story line, and a great cast. All the actors are credible and look like everyday people, which makes the show more real.I am not a big fan of shows when kids are the main characters, but "" stranger things "" really took me by surprise.The only flaw would be Mrs Wynona Ryder. A very mediocre actress, if you ask me, with a lot of dry cries for a mother who just lost her favorite son.Anyway, I am looking forward season 2. Thank you Netflix for those great shows."
1135,"This series was a great mixture of several genres done in a style similar to horror and sci-fi movies from the eighties. It didn't quite hook me right away, but because it was so talked about, I kept on going. I'm glad I finished it, because the payoff was worth it. I think every episode had at least one moment that made me think of E.T. I also thought it had a similar feel to an old show called Tales From The Darkside--strange things were going on, but it didn't quite cross completely into horror territory. My favorite characters were Eleven-- of course--and Dustin. The whole thing just made me want to ride my bike around my old neighborhood and play Dungeons and Dragons all night long. It was pretty special, and I didn't just enjoy it--I'm thankful for it."
1136,"I've been struggling to find a decent TV show that would hopefully keep my attention during the entire episode since The Walking Dead is on a lengthy hiatus(kaslfj!!!jdsak!!!). Anyway, I saw the trailer and thought it seemed promising. Turns out, I wasn't mistaken. The acting is excellent and more than believable. The child actors should be applauded and praised heavily. They are just amazing. It has a bit of everything: horror, suspense, thriller, supernatural and the things invaluable, such as: friendship, society, family. I haven't seen the whole season yet but I'm on it as I write. I just needed people to know that YES, it is worth it. Just try it. You've got nothing to lose, just gain."
1137,"From the show's opening sequence, Stranger Things already showed promise. The chase in the Hawkins National Laboratory, the game of Dungeons & Dragons, and the disappearance of Will, showed to me that the show will have it's fun moments, but it can also turn dark and ominous & that's what it turned out to be throughout the series. The story revolves around a group of young friends, an unnerved mother, a fellow policeman and a mysterious young girl who are on a journey to find Will, who at first was presumed to be dead. However, when they realize his death was fake, they 'venture together through an alternate universe, fight an alien-like monster, and unravel the secrets of the government. The show does a great job with keeping a constant and smooth plot. After you finish an episode, it leaves you wanting more. Overall, I think this series is one of Netflix's greatest original shows. It's almost difficult to find any flaws. (9/10)(P.S, the intro theme is fantastic! it had an amazing 80's vibe.)"
1138,"I loved Stranger Things to the core ! For a series with just 8 episodes and 1 season under the belt, this turned out to be a creepy, spine chilling yet compelling original series. The Duffer brothers who took the helm for Stranger things absolutely nailed it with their creative and self assured way of story telling. Every episode kept me on the edge and i simply could not muster myself to wait for the another day to finish it off. Winona Ryder, David Harbour and the five kids around whom the story revolved were all perfect for the role and the acting from their side was top notch! The casting team, the background score team and the special effects team, all did an amazing job. I chipped off 1 vote out of 10 for the slowness introduced into the story with the side story covering Natalia Dyer's character. I hope that whoever signs off these originals for Netflix gets a pay-raise soon. You simply cannot stumble upon Sense 8, Gotham, Daredevil, Master of None et all without having the sort of talent that he/she has."
1139,"One of the best series I've seen this year. Full of good adventures, the best of some 80 films. The series makes you remember why live one of your best moments with your group of friends. It makes part of experiences, danger and mystery that slowly resolved. Undoubtedly a series full of magic, which is here to stay and that many already expect its second season.Netflix series tells the story of four children immersed in a web of suspense and terror, complemented by monsters, parallel dimensions and many analog devices. The popularity of the series has grown exponentially since it was launched in mid-July, delighting audiences around the world. In Latin America it became an instant success and the young cast was immediately elevated to the rank of major Hollywood stars."
1140,"Stranger Things is a mash up of Sci-Fi horror that feels fresh in the resulting tale. If you're wondering what it's like, very topically, it's like The X-Files without any UFOs told, largely, from a kid's point of view. The child actors in the story are all excellent and the adult interaction is there too. You'll be attached to the cast and there's even the requisite bad folks too, all in addition to a nasty monster. It's an out-there story much like Steven King meets John Carpenter so, in spite of it's crazy nature it has a good quality which propels it nicely.The kids here just nail it. That wide-eyed ""anything's possible"" ethos is front and center. They make it fun to watch this story because they're so natural and lovable. They meet an exceptional girl simply called ""11"" due to her nature of being a product of some strange government experimentation resulting in, for lack of any other term, superpowers. She's certainly been damaged in the process and after just one episode you won't be able to imagine this crucial role being better portrayed than by the young actress Millie Bobby Brown. She's incredible in her fragility and broken youth. The other youngsters are just as good and all deserve high accolades. Then there's the adults of whom David Harbour, the town police chief, builds an important bond with the viewer. In his own loss he's become a bit of a loose cannon mess. He's about to go too far in his life and job when the small Hawkins community suddenly goes him a few better. He's the first one to sense a sinister government is behind the high-strangeness making his character one the viewer will latch on to and fully get behind.I'd say a wild story like this could have easily gone off the rails, but it never does. The Duffer Brothers who wrote and guided it deserve much credit as I'm sure it wasn't easy finding the mix of young actors/actresses to properly pull it off. They nailed it all around. It feels like a quality big-budget movie instead of just another Sci-Fi mini-series. If you like both Steven King and The X-Files I would practically guarantee you'll find Stranger Things right to your liking. Even fleshed out at eight episodes it's definitely good enough to go another season if the writing and acting levels are sustained."
1141,"The series is perfect, holds the attention from start to finish. Each episode is well designed, intrigue and surprises the viewer, causing the desire to immediately begin the next stay latent. The script is something to admire, as it is not seen in most current series. Who watches sit within the story, and you can understand perfectly the lashings of the whole plot, despite the suspense is maintained with full logic to the facts presented. The actors give a show and perfectly fulfill the role of convincing the audience. Especially Winona Ryder (Joyce), wronged in the film industry, and dressed the mother of the character of the missing boy, is convincing in every scene, there is no way to excite and cheer for her. Also noteworthy young Millie Brown (Eleven), which surprises the best suspense scenes with his mysterious character. The soundtrack helps take us to the show room and was delicately chosen according to the time when the story takes place. The house opening track perfectly with the art and serves as an appetizer for what lie ahead.In general, the series surprised by the quality, because it is produced by a streaming service company, to escape the current tiresome theme of making remakes or show zombies, superheroes, vampires or police investigation, to bring a sense nostalgic big productions the years 80/90 for children's characters are so prominent in an adult series, and for various other reasons I could spend all day listing here, but invite those who did not attend have this experience, it is very pity brought me back to have interest in series again."
1142,"I gave this a 10 because it really was scary. I do not recommend it for kids because of the content it portrays, behavioral wise, demon-wise and child abuse and animal abuse-wise. I am NOT a fan of Winona Ryder. As a matter of fact, I never watch anything she is in, but when I saw the trailer I decided to watch it anyway. I was very taken aback at how good she was in this. She is obviously more mature and not the dweeb she used to be. As far as kids watching this - it obviously seems to be directed towards the age group the kids are in the movie, but this will give them nightmares. It is a collage of many horror movies put together, including a rip off from my favorite SciFi of all time, Aliens, but still maintains some uniqueness. My favorite character in the movie was the cop, who actually followed up on leads instead of being the lazy, paycheck sucking up bum that he appeared to be in the beginning. OMG, that little girl, ""EL"" has a blood-curdling scream. They can do a lot more with this so I guess there will be a Season 2?"
1143,"Stranger things was stranger than most of the shows I have watched, and I have watched quite a few of them. The show starts off as a tale of an abduction and melds the paranormal or supernatural to the mix elegantly. It slowly increases the dose of the mystic in time making it part of the show in a flawless manner. The best part of the show me were the kids, brave yet foolish and the laws of friendship they faithfully abide. Winona Ryder as Joyce was a master-stroke, she portrays the vulnerable and living mother with perfection. Each of the characters including the ever-encouraging biology teacher was crafted beautifully. One of my favorite moments if the show was where Joyce talks to El before trying to track will, it is undeniably exquisite. One can notice her love for Will and also the care she takes for a strange child who is trying to help her. One cannot deny the chemistry of the three little machos.All in all it was an awesome show , good script, good dialogues, epic acting and novelty. Hats-off to Duffer Brothers and waiting for season 2."
1144,"I haven't seen it all yet, in fact I'm only up to S1 E4. But I can say this- One of the greatest horror stories that I ever read was Dean Koontz's The Door to December. This series so far is following a very similar story line, if not THE story line. Change a few characters around and a few scenes, it is almost the same. I always loved that book, and always wanted to see a movie made of it, and now there is one! Similarities: Weird young girl who was raised in a medical research facility and had no outside contact with the rest of the world. She has supernatural powers. She escaped and is on the run. She is befriended by other kids her age- in the book, she is being helped by her mother and a private investigator.There is an evil creature of some sort- in the book it is a dark shadow- in the movie it is some kind of humanoid figure with no face.The evil creature is killing people. I don't want to say any more just in case it is in fact following the book, because the ending was brilliant!I cant wait to see the end!"
1145,"The detailed re-construction of life in the 1980s is awesome. There are details like Dungeons and Dragons board games and even 80s wallpaper on each set.The children are fantastic actors and there are many throwback hints to the 80s in the whole show, such as even the introduction which is kind of 'Tron-esk'. There are posters that tribute films like Jaws and the Thing, plus news clips from the 80s, even embracing the 'commies' paranoia that was around at that time. It can be watched by children of today, but also by adults who grew up through the 80s who will appreciate it even more. Even though it is set in America, there was obviously an English adviser/crew member as even 'The Smiths' are mentioned and many other 80s throwback memories from life in the UK too. I really hope that there are more episodes, and that 'sea monkeys' and 'gob stoppers' are mentioned in future episodes, along with GI Joe, skateboards and fluorescent mis-matched socks. And don't forget 'Eagle Eyes action figures, where the parachute version resulted in throwing out an action man out the window, only to see the parachute tangle up and end up in a sad tangled mess on the ground lol. In all, an absolute happy tonic to the soul if you grew up through the 80s!"
1146,"This is one of the best shows I have watched. It stands on the tier of many great shows in the media today. I am not a huge fan of Sci-Fi films and shows, but this one was just absolutely amazing. It surpassed all of the expectations I had for it. Immediately when I hear aliens, I was nervous about beginning this show. Needless to say, I am glad I took a chance. The character development is fabulous. I became very connected with every character involved. The all around mood and setting is extremely cinematic! The score was great! I watched this with my mom who enjoyed the music a lot being that the music was from the 80s. It gave me a Super 8 vibe, the movie by J.J. Abrams. I really enjoyed that movie as well even though it was Sci-Fi, but I think this show is far better and I was very impressed with Super 8. I loved it! I strongly recommend this show for all ages! It had me on the edge of my seat until the final episode's credits rolled."
1147,"It's creepy and watching it made me so anxious I had to stop. I don't care what other people might say about this show, it's just terrible!!
The plot is confusing and it's just random."
1148,"Again I am mystified as to how this, at best mediocre series is so revered and loved. And with the most unattractive cast to boot. They must have searched far and wide to be this consistent. Barely hanging in there with the plodding storyline and won't get back to this for a while; what with so many other superior series ( actually all ) to watch. I. Just. Don't. Get. It. The only interesting character in S1 was 11. With her not in this episode till the end made this an excruciating chore to watch. At least if they had likable characters but there's nary a one except for her. If I continue to watch I will not be able to stop shaking my head. Watch Mindhunters or The Punisher for entertainment instead!!!!"
1149,"This show is horrible. Boring, couldn't even finish the first season. Wasn't scary, there was no mystery because I just didn't care, the characters aren't believable or likeable. This is supposed to be a nostalgic show but it even failed at that. Arguably one of the worst shows I've seen on Netflix, this company is really going downhill and running out of original ideas. Must not have had the budget to hire a decent cast and put in some half decent special effects. Nothing about this show is worth watching."
1150,Very good and mysterious show. I think this is a must watch.
1151,"Note: I've only watched season 1. as of now.I'm writing this because the hype over the 2nd season reminded me of this show. And frankly, of how much I was disappointed when I watched it last year, tempted by stellar reviews.How ""Stranger Things"" got these reviews, I still can't understand. Could everybody be blinded by nostalgia to such an extent that they forgot it was a NEW series? That it should offer something more than heaps of references to be good? In fact, that it desperately needed some steering away from the plot devices straight outta the 80s - not to end up worn out as hell? Ugh. This series wasn't a nod to 80s stylistics. It was a rip off.I could end up liking it anyway if it was more character-driven - even if the plot is fairly simple, it's still fun to watch strong characters deal with it. It wasn't. I watched a standard set of small town Stephen King characters, lead by a bunch of kids on bikes. Stereotypes, stereotypes everywhere. Could this have been more derivative? Giving it a 2 for capturing the elusive 80s vibe. They nailed it. As far as everything else goes, I'll give the 2nd season a try. But if it's as ""good"" as the last one... I'll probably be snoring halfway through episode 1."
1152,"Stranger Things is a story about these kids/people who experience the great unknown. Except they seem to know awfully lot about it because convenience. In fact, the writing is so convenient that it often becomes annoying and destroys the immersion. People said Lucy was a bad movie because pseudo-science. Time to put some salt in my bathtub and enter the shadow world to make sure! After all, that's what the science teacher said and omg it twerks!! This is called asspullery.Originality wise this is nothing original. Execution nor the character are nothing special either. Stranger Things is a very typical title from the mystery genre, but it came out in a good time, especially for those who see their series on Netflix. Every series is now about politics, lawyers, superheroes or superhero lawyers who fight against politicians. Stranger Things is not fresh, but it is good change and might even seem original when comparing to our other titles. Some call it the nostalgia train, but I guess some people are getting those vibes from the new Ghostbusters too, so yeah.The characters can basically be put into two groups: ""kids who are too smart"" and ""adults who didn't listen."" We also have under-casted cop who acts too well, save- the-day Mary Sue alien and bad Fonzie who can't keep himself out from the screen. You can basically forget every one of them in a month and few years later wonder ""hmm where have I see this fella before?"" when they randomly get casted on a movie/series you end up watching. The baddies were also really shallow in this. One-dimensional to the max. I wonder if they could have covered it better in a movie. I am still not sure why exactly I liked the series despite all the mediocrity. I guess you could say it did good job capturing the atmosphere. But still it often end up ruining it with character flaws. The mystery seemed quite interesting after the start, so it did manage to take me with it. First 2 episodes were bad and the conclusion was meh. In fact, the conclusion was so unoriginal that it alone made me drop the score from 6/10 to 5/10. There is some nice songs in the OST. I end up listening them afterwards too. Well, the series is over now. Time to move on and leave it among the hundreds of other titles that were as entertaining.edit: update 11/11/17 - I have now finished S02 and it was a solid 8/10. My opinion on S01 hasn't changed."
1153,S1&2 was amazing and s3 is even better. Go watch it you won't regret it
1154,"I don't want to ruin the party but i guess people are not picky anymore. Not just movies, life in general. They just eat what is given to them. And they don't complain, they ask for more. I guess quality doesn't mean much anymore... ""Stranger Things"" is not the worst TV show. The general atmosphere and the cast are pretty good but it's one of those shows with the obvious and now tiring, Hollywood recipe ! Poor screenplay (story already seen a million times), good actors but poor dialogues (not well written at all), and Winona Ryder... Oh my god, she is just moaning and crying the entire show. I guess Stranger Things hits nostalgic people in the heart but come on, be honest, we are far from Spielberg, Zemeckis, Lucas... the worst is yet to come, as we're gonna get Season two ! Oh my God, you can sense they don't even know where they're going."
1155,"Watching this TV series was like eating a beautiful looking plate of food and then puking your guts out.It started out great. Excellent retro feel and cinematography, promising premise and story line, and a wonderful cast. And then it all went to hell.Things moved along nicely out of the gate and then all of a sudden scenes became contrived and unbelievable. It then hit the wall and was just plain stupid in every way. I was actually screaming at the TV and also very upset for wasting my time in the first place.More specifically, the rapid-fire switching from scene to scene to I guess create more action was amateur hour. The insertion of slow and meaningless scenes to offer contrast to faster moving scenes was obvious, in a very bad way. They then throw in the constant flashbacks interrupting the flow in a most annoying manner. The only way I could get through it was by fast-forwarding through most of the scenes.In the end, the only audience that could possible appreciate this garbage would be kids under the age of 10. Such a waste too given the premise, cinematography and cast. The directors and producers should be ashamed because if this was done by competent people it could have been brilliant."
1156,"I'm confused by all the hate I'm reading on season 3. I'm hearing things like predictable and to much humor,? I mean after season 2 which kinda blew in my opinion. You're upset they went back to the winning formula that made season 1 the phenomenon that it was? ?? Of course it's predictable. And silly. It's meant to entertain not change the world. It's a damn sight better than Game of Thrones season 8. I mean honestly I expected to hate this season... I'm absolutely freaking loving it."
1157,"Overused tv tropes, stale clichés with no end, painfully nonsensical plot points.
By the end of Episode 5 of Season 1 I was furious about how stupid everyone was acting, Actually, I started feeling insulted by by the awful writing. Against better judgement, I gave it one last chance but after 15 minutes of Episode 6 I had to turn it off because I couldn't bear the stupidity anymore.
How can this be considered a good series (well, the first two seasons at least)??
Are people so overdosed on soundtrack and production design induced nostalgia that their brains shut down??
What is going on? Why? How? WTF?"
1158,"Season 3 is very entertaining. Although nothing has topped season 1 (if that were possible); season 3 certainly holds it own and gives us what we love about the series: Eighties nostalgia, cliff hanging horror, and a generally good story. The critical reviews on here have some credence because there are some real cheesy parts. A few episodes are like an eighties movie spoof which doesn't play well with those of us that like the sci-fi thriller that we seek. But the critical reviews are a bit too harsh. Every episode written and directed by the Duffer brothers is great. The filler episodes done by others so far are forgettable. I'd recommend watching it; next season hopefully it will be more sci-fi thriller and less romance killer.
P.S. After writing this to be fair if it wasn't for the cheesy romance parts we wouldn't have the laughs either so keep that door 3 inches open and sing it proud Dusty-buns."
1159,"Netflix has had a bad run when it comes to putting out some good shows, but they nailed it with Stranger Things, or at least season one.Season One:
This show came out of no where and really surprised me, other than the visual effects it seemed like a film that could easily be released into cinemas. Mostly great acting, interesting and new story. Along with a lot of other factors this show was surprisingly at very good quality.
8/10Season Two:
With the amount of people loving season one, they would inevitably make season two. And to be honest, it would be hard to top the last season. I found season two lacking in a lot of features that the season before it contained. I found the story quite repetitive and the writing felt a bit sloppy. The issues with the last season stood out a lot more this time. But I still found myself enjoying it.
6/10Season Three:
Where should I start. Season three, is quite a mixed bag for me. A lot of the things happening in this season I enjoyed. I liked Dustin and Steve's adventure into the communist base and I also liked Jim and Joyce's plot line. But sadly again, it felt very repetitive. Especially the plot line with all the other kids. The monster this time is just the last one but bigger. This acutally remined me of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Starkiller base is just the Death Star but bigger. Another issue I had was with the writing in characters, I felt a lot of characters were underused and forgotten about Will, Nancy and Jonathan come in mind as they do not feel as fleshed out as the rest of the gang. The writing did not feel as realistic as the last two seasons. One of the reasons I loved season one of stranger things was due to the unique characters but this season felt like a high school musical with embarrassingly cheesy lines, and not this the delivery of some of those lines was quite terrible. I never really liked Mikes actor I felt as if he fell short compared to the rest of the actors and this time it really stood out. Overall, season three was pretty disappointing. Quite a few of the characters are boring and have nothing to do. The story is repetitive and it was overall just underwhelming. I would skip this if you are not a massive fan.
4/10"
1160,"I expected more from this show. Stranger Things didn't surprised me. The first 4 episodes are slow and boring and the final episode is not epic.The best was the ambiance, a very good art direction (even 3D is designedly badly done). This TV series have a good sci-fi and adventure history but a bad horror and mystery. Acting is good, but writing is not. Good and bad points.It's not horrible but it's not a big show, it's just a 80's blockbuster so I think the nostalgia feeling is sedating people.6/10"
1161,"How does this show have a 9.2 rating? It's not bad, but definitely not 9.2 material.The show is completely unoriginal, through and through. There is not a single character or plot-point that is particularly memorable. The fanboys will claim that it's a ""homage"" and that ""good art borrows, great art steals"", but this show is just... flat. You've got your little suburban boys riding around on their bikes, getting terrorized by bullies. You've got your wholesome teen girl who falls in with the wrong crowd and dealing with peer pressure. Shadowy government experiments, it all plays out in the most cliché way imaginable.I read some reviewers claim that that's just in the beginning it seems flat and cliché, and that later it gets deeper... but it never does. Instead the plot-holes mount up, the story arc reaches its underwhelming has climax, and then the cheesy ending.I enjoyed it well enough though. I am entertained. I liked the retrowave soundtrack, acting and cinematography are good."
1162,Hi guys and gals!This series is the best in the genre (series/mystery) in a long time.And who delivers again...? You already know: Netflix. They hardly every miss on their exclusive content.The Duffer brothers made it big this time. I liked them from Wayward Pines excellent scripts.The casting is great!This series will be appreciated in by most from 10-88yo.For those like me who grew up in the 80s this series have a nostalgic vibe also. I won't spoil and don't go into details.I hope you enjoy it as much as i did!Have a great time in front of the screen of choice!Till next time!
1163,"Imagine if the atmosphere of Twin Peaks had a child with Super 8's mystique and gave birth to Silent Hill's eerie quality with a hint of X-files's flavor - that's Stranger Things for you.There are so many things about it that are very unlike what you see on TV, due to more freedom given by Netflix. It's refreshing. It's suspenseful. It leaves you feeling like you're actually THERE and you're feeling EVERYTHING. It's really hard to describe. All I can say is that you really feel like you go into a whole new world when you watch this. Even though it has kids in it, I wouldn't call it a kids show at all and wouldn't recommend you let your younger children watch it, as it may disturb them. It's not particularly gory, but it's a psychological twister.If you like a good mystery with a dash of supernatural, you'll like this."
1164,"Enjoyable is how I would describe this. Really loved the premise, the actors, and how well-made and polished this looks. Binge-watched it in a day. This is one of those things that you cannot let go once you have started watching, and even when the 8 episodes(totaling almost to 8 hours)do end, you wish it could be longer. I am already looking forward to the next season(Please Netflix, say you are too!)! So, all those sci-fi crazed fans like me, go ahead and watch this. There is an overall shroud of mystery that fits the story-line. The town of Hawkins, with its rain-drenched roads, and dark forests, is tailor-made to host the finale which will leave you wanting for more! Happy binging folks!"
1165,"I don't know how it works but this cast and the way it was put together was classic. It's has a feeling of Stars Wars or other classic movies, well done."
1166,"Very good s1 and s2 STOP there, not as good as the Dark though but lots to like al the same.If you like this type of thing though. Try the dark or even better the OA"
1167,"OK. I have decided that Stranger Things is kind of a kiddie ""Lost-wannabe"". I don't care what kind of ratings this show is pulling, it's really not that good. I'm trying, but i'm pretty sure it's going to fizzle out for me. I need more substance less blah blah blah. Right now it's hitting at a 4 for me. Whynona needs to take some meds. She's just not making it as a convincing character. My absolute favorite character is the chief of police. I do like him. The rest are just not very likable. And come on, the nose-bleeder really should've grasped some of the English language as she was talked to fairly normally even though she was in a very weird situation. Overall, the acting is mediocre to real bad and the storyline is mediocre to borrrring. I'm on episode six.....give me something.....I need something to keep me interested or yawn......zzzzzzzzzzzzzz."
1168,"The 3rd season was thrilling, fun and scary. The directors nailed it"
1169,"The show is growing every season into something bigger than the last. Sure the random underground Russian base is a little far fetch but the production of this show as a whole, especially season 3, is simply stunning. The CGI work is easily the best I've ever seen for a show. Most high budget movies don't play out and/or look this amazing. Also, the design of the gooie Mind Flayer, well done."
1170,"I don't think I need to stress much about season 1 of Stranger Things. By now we all know that the show had an amazing pilot season, fueled by the 80s nostalgia and an overall sound casting, writing and direction.The problem with season 2 was that the show writers weren't willing to diverge much from their already established formula of success. And this led to a season, which albeit, some great character development, was ultimately a loosely based copy of season 1.The show writers clearly realised the problem, and tried to make amends in season 3. I'm just not sure if ""evil Russians"" are the way to go. Season 3 saw the writers take too much privilege to do too many wierd things. Firstly, puberty is always a rough patch in any show, then the needless banter on politics, making Erica a main character in spite of her being extremely annoying, separating the central group into two parts, and many others. And yet, I enjoyed it for some reason!I mean, yes, the show has always had some glaring loopholes, and many conveniences, but these factors aren't really what one looks out for in Stranger Things. I feel the show was a success (at least for me) because the characters are fun, the dialogues are smart and edgy, the story beautifully balances suspense and comic relief. Stranger Things is more of a fun-to-watch show for me, than an amazing-story show. For this very reason, season 3 was an equally enjoyable binge for me, if not more enjoyable. The Mall was a great idea, the awkwardness in their relationships warrants a good laugh or two, and notwithstanding some of the weird decisions, the story is also pretty fun. Although I feel, another season of more humour than suspense would probably make the show grow stale. But from what I hear, season 4 will be more intense, so fingers crossed..."
1171,Max want blackmailed Dustin's new girlfriend and Eleven and Erika in evil way to hurt Mike. The plastic girl turn show Mike to be stronger.
1172,"A Perfect blend of Horror, Sci-fi, Action, Thriller, Romance, Advanture and Comedy. Grest casting and direction. You will not see the world same after watching this."
1173,"I don't care what anyone says about season 3, because for me it doesn't matter at all. This show is as the title says a goddamn masterpiece and I'm sure season 4 will be amazing."
1174,"The story,the screenplay,the characters,the cast everything is just great.One of the best series from Netflix.You would fall in love with each and every character of the series especially the kids who are the life of this show. The story will keep u engaged for all three seasons and as we know Season 4 is also coming. So yeah high expectations with it.If you still haven't watched it then what are u waiting for just watch it."
1175,"I'd give season 1 a 10, 2 an 8 and 3 a 9. Hope you're not too confused."
1176,"This show is fun, suspenseful, thrilling and nostalgic. The writers do an excellent job building the storyline and developing the characters episode by episode. I'm not typically in to sci-fi fantasy movies or shows but caved to the popularity and well, yup! I get it. Definitely recommend."
1177,"First class l like the direction of the serie
Sound casting and others..."
1178,"Boring, childish and content is not good... I mean the show is so terrible"
1179,"Season 1 is a derivative work of nostalgia, but season 2 is a bizarre character study of an obscene small town in Indiana. There's a manic schizophrenic mother who goes off on psychotic benders. Her youngest son is an epileptic that becomes catatonic because he's being molested by his older brother, ""the shadow monster."" The local sheriff finds out the government is abducting children to perform MK-Ultra-like supernatural experiments on. In exchange for keeping quiet and covering up the scandal the sheriff is given a young girl. The sheriff keeps the prepubscent girl locked in a creepy secluded cabin that becomes their love nest, much to the envy of Drake.I can't watch the show anymore, I had to stop halfway through season 2. Non-perceptive cattle view Stranger Things as sci-fi entertainment, but it's really a series for the pedo elite Illuminati masquerading as metaphors. What's really scary is that they are waving their sick comic stories in our faces and nobody recognizes the filth for what it is.There's a sizable amount of sickos running Hollywood right now. That's the only way to explain the weird stuff they make."
1180,"Okay, I've been watching this show since it was first released. It's a decent show, but has major flaws. The biggest one being: it's unoriginality. It steals so many things from different films. Eleven (El) has a power similar to the force, some of the creatures resemble the creature from The Thing, The Blob and Silent Hill. Even the concept of a group of kids trying to fight an evil demonic being is similar to It. The story is very predictable and at times it's pretty cheesy. But it's still pretty entertaining. The characters are decent (for the most part) and it is fun to watch. But over all, I'm not impressed with it. Definitely not a masterpiece or anything. I think it's overrated."
1181,"I thought this was easily the best season out of all 3, which really shocked me. This show masters the concepts of character development, atmosphere, and combining horror with comedy.
You genuinely feel for every character in this show, even for Billy who is part of the attempt to take over the human race. The relationships built between Elle and Mike, Max and Lucas, Nancy and Jonathon, as well as with Hopper and Joyce are simply top tier and you begin to support every single one. you feel for the internal struggles of the characters growing up and being confused, whether it's Mike not quite understanding relationships and girls and having trust issues, or Will struggling to grow up with the rest of his friends and accept change. It's real word stuff, and the relatability of it makes it great.
The atmosphere of this show is like no other. it really genuinely makes you think these kids are from the 80's, even though they were all born post 2000. The outfits, the music, the pop culture, the environment they live in is all perfect. The thing that really made me extremely appreciative of this season is the addition of Star Court mall. the amount of time spent in this mall throughout the season really makes you notice just how much detail the creators of this show put into the setting of it. every last inch of that mall is straight out of the 80's. we've seen the kids in arcades and other iconic 80's locations before, but the addition of the mall just hit different and really solidified this series as a phenomenal piece of art, able to bring anybody back in time. I know that the guys on the pod always joke about Finn Wolfhard only having roles where he is riding his bike all over town, which is very true to this point in his career, but there's just something about the way he presents his characters. He has an aesthetic about him that makes him fit into any retro themed role, and he presents such depth and emotional performances in his roles that he makes you feel for his character every time. I don't think he'd be the same actor that many people love if he just played a kid in a modern setting.
The last thing i'd like to point out is the comedy and horror combination that this show provides. Viewers can watch this show and laugh like crazy while still becoming tense and scared of all the darkness that the show provides. A big factor to the comedy is the chemistry between these characters. The actors are truly all best friends and spend a major potion of their time together, and because of this, whenever the characters make fun of each other or make jokes it's always hilarious because it seems like something you would do with your best friends. The really great part about the comedy of this show however is that you can be presented the scariest, darkest situation of how the world is about to be destroyed, yet they are still able to throw other situations and jokes in there that make you laugh. Perfect examples of this are towards the end of the season, with Dustin and Susie as well as Steve and Robin. At the time of the comedic relief of Dustin and his long distance girlfriend Susie, we are at the most suspenseful and important part of the series, where Joyce, Hopper and Murray are executing their plan against the Russians to destroy their machine. When Dustin is asking Susie for the code to unlock the safe and she keeps playing with him I found myself actually screaming at the TV. But then out of nowhere they bring the most charming moment of the series in my opinion, and break out singing The Never Ending Story, which you can't stop yourself from bringing a smile to your face. The directors are able to make you go from frightened and worried for the characters to laughing at the bond of Dustin and Susie in the matter of seconds. With Steve and Robin, they have their lives at stake with the Russians, and viewers are under the impression that they are going to die, and even they begin to reminisce on life as if they're living their last moments. But then they get drugged, and the funniest moments of the series follow suit. These characters are in huge trouble and could potentially die at any moment but you can't help but laugh out loud at their interactions with each other and the bond built when they're both under the influence. Another perfect example of taking a scary and suspenseful situation and making it watchable for any viewer by lightening it with comedy. I never watch TV shows and always think they're too long and stretched out no matter what, but somehow the creators of this show get me hooked for 8-10 one hour long episodes every time they release a new season. It's truly perfect television in my eyes."
1182,"Thank you Netflix and Duffer Brothers for creating this amazing amalgam of a world. There are many reasons i like Stranger Things. It is the perfect balance of the innocent children growing up in a small town Hawkins. There's comedy, drama, sci fic and lots of references to the popular culture from the 80s. It's actually a tribute to all those things which made the 80s 80s, like the Ghost Busters, Terminator, Back to the future, the sounds, the indoor games. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too. Every actor or actress is putting in a lot of effort, and that goes for both children and adults. If you are reading this review and have not yet checked out Stranger Things, you must."
1183,"From the score, to the cinematography, to the locations, everything about this show is perfect. when the theme songs begins at the beginning of the episode, it gives me the chills because i am so excited to watch. i started watching season 1 & 2 a little later than others but once i finished i was obsessed. after finishing season three i cried once, if i'm honest i cried about maybe 5 times. i can't wait to see what stranger things four has in store for us!!!"
1184,"This show is literally the best! It is like all the stuff from the 80's but with better CGI. Cliffhangers at the end of EVERY episode. It has your stereotypical group of kids but a not so stereotypical story line and execution of said story line. A fun show that NEVER fails to please and is only seconded by The CW's ""The Flash."" On my must watch list for anyone!"
1185,"OK to be honest I have been hard on Netflix productions and still find half are just plain pointless drivel and far from entertaining but not so this time. Sure lots of adolescents as the leads but wow are they good! Not a Wynona Ryder fan but she doesn't turn my stomach this time.A group of kids in Indiana encounter strange happenings with much of the mystery centered around a secretive lab in their small town. Multi-dimensions filled with Lovercraft style horrors invade and this small band of intrepid heroes find themselves in a battle to save mankind. Oops, sorry not pc. Humankind.Special effects, creature effects, writing, directing, acting all mesh in a cohesive story that entertains. Excellent for entire family. Well done Netflix."
1186,"It's the perfect mini series featuring all genres: Mystery, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, Love, Adventure, Horror, all of the above! A gr8 series your whole family will enjoy. Targets anybody, all ages. The Producers have done a gr8 job with each characters scripts, which keeps you on edge with what's going to happen next.I love all the young actors, especially El, she does an amazing job at acting! The whole story line was well needed thought out, and pulls at every one of your emotions.I can't wait to see a sequel, and can only guess what will happen next. I rate it a 10/10! Totally worth while watching:)"
1187,"Hello viewers ,I stumbled across this series just going through trailers on youtube a days back, My taste is very different when it comes to watching movies or TV-series, Its the first episode if it impresses me or the first 20 minutes of the movie, then I go aheaad and watch it completely,I had been very fond of watching X-files during school-days, after that I didn't come across a series so engaging and fascinating as this, Seriously I must say , the whole team of this show has put in a mind- blowing effort to make it super thrilling with the added mysterical background music and the hair-raising environment.I give 10 out of 10 rating for making this show a reality!!"
1188,"So much potential at the start. Romantic 80's well replicated with moody synth reminiscent of b-grade horror sci-fi. A well picked cast downtrodden heartfelt nerdy kids + others. Thing is, the dialogue, story telling and production quality began a rapid downward spiral. The end result was little more than color by numbers entertainment which I began to skip through to find the paranormal bits. Afterwards the series as a whole this left me an absent feeling wondering ""why?"" Did something happened which sap the passion out of the production. Some kind of derivative art vampire? The cause of the decline in production quality for me holds much more intrigue than the forced mystery this series suggests it is attempting to convey."
1189,"The first season was a little glitchy but I was willing to let some of that go because the story line was cool. Opening scene one of the kids says ""Just saying"" which is a now term. Season 2, there are so many wholes in the story. There is a scene where someone uses a smart phone, in 1984? Come on people. I was so excited to watch it and yet so disappointed. GRRRRRRR"
1190,"This is a masterpiece! This serie makes me feel many emotions like I'm there with the children and that actress ""El"" is playing her character for an Oscar she deserve it."
1191,Wynona Ryder is tremendous. Natalie Dyer needs to eat something. Joe Keery needs a haircut and Darce Montgomery needs a slap.All the younger kids are phenomenal. The soundtrack makes it. Captures that 80's feel perfectly. It's Stand By Me (1986). It's The Goonies (1985). Its Carrie (1976). Its Firestarter (1984). Its The Go-Kids/Frog Dreaming (1986). It's The Terminator (1984). Its Aliens (1986). Its Ghostbusters (1984). It's ET (1982). It's Red Dawn (1984). It's Day of the Dead (1985). It's everything you loved about 80's cinema rolled into one.
1192,The overacting and unnecessary hysterics of Winona Ryder make this series nearly unwatchable. Two stars for the good performances by the kids.
1193,"Great storyline, action, thriller, comedy and so nostalgic for an 80's kid! The soundtrack is on point! Not only was the show enjoyable to watch for us adults in the home, but for our tween. A must watch! If it's in the works, we're looking forward to season 4!!!"
1194,"It was pretty good, the first and the second season I think were awesome but I think they ruined it with the third season. But still I would highly recommend it to my friends.
I love almost every actor/actress on the serie, mostly the kids, they were awesome.
For me its a 8.5!!"
1195,"I am so in love with the characters and it is amazing watching them grow up! great acting, the colors were so beautiful. I am ready for season 4 already. Good Job Duffer brothers."
1196,"Great performances, perfect direction, fantastic story! Please everybody see it! People do not miss it!"
1197,"It goes without question that this show is one the most popular and beloved around the world, and I could see how that's the case. However, I wouldn't call this show ""overrated,"" because overrated means something that is mediocre but is somehow popular (I.E: Sword Art Online, Cardi B, Michael Bay's Transformer films). Now is this show overhyped...? Yes. VERY. But it is far from mediocre, it's a good, entertaining show.This show isn't as bad as the one-star reviewers claim, it isn't as good as the ten stars are claiming. I can safely place this show at a solid 7/10. I can also safely bet that if this show didn't ride the nostalgia coattails so hard, or was set in the present day, a lot of reviewers would be rating this show a lot differently, perhaps even lower than my own score. I've seen some reviewers rate this show a solid ten simply due to the fact that its set in the 1980s.Nostalgia is a powerful thing and it's great that some viewers resonate so stronger with a show that's set in a specific period in time. Personally, I'm not swayed by nostalgia that tough, I pay more attention to the story being told rather than when it's set. ST is more of a homage to Stephen King's novels, namely 'Firestarter' and 'IT' and movies likes ""The Goonies."" It's not widely original but it's doesn't care to be.The show kept me entertained but that's about it. Season 1 is by far the best, season 2 was just... okay. I found season 2 lacking the mystery and suspense that carried the first year. I haven't gotten around to 3 yet but I'll be sure to check it out.All in all, ST is a good show. Not bad nor great, just GOOD."
1198,"It seems to be typical Netflix (with the exception of a few shows that continue to be great throughout like House of Cards). The first season of ST was great. And then I watch Season 2, and it is just boring and pathetic. It's the same way with Sense8 and Hemlock Grove, to name a few examples of this trend. S01 is great, S02 is pathetic. Oh, well, there are plenty of awesome shows out there to watch from networks that are much better than Netflix."
1199,"Maybe I missed something... OK: where did they get all those cars from a time where no cars survived? That is the only reason for a 2 otherwise it would have been a 1 show. I am sitting here with a lot of questions: Why did they kill the poor Cook? Why does the police chief keep his finger in the trigger all the time? Why is the story predictable?Why is it so boring? Why put a 1,5h Movie in a 8 hour series? Why are so many questions unanswered? Why can the girl shoot the monster 12 times with a six shooter? Why is everything back to normal after Will gets back and the whole different dimension stuff seems to bother nobody?Why are all the characters so shallow?Questions over questions..."
1200,"I thought it was wonderful. It reminded me of so many of my favorite things. Stephen King, Stephen Spielberg, The Goonies and on and on. other review's site other examples of how it took the reviewers back. It took the best pieces and parts from amazing outlets and spun it into an original masterpiece. It had action, it had romance, it had friendship and coming of age, it had horror, and conspiracy,it had sweetness, hope, failure, and triumph. I know people now a days try to outdo each other with who can find the most inaccuracies and plot holes, but just sit back and watch this like you sat back in the eighties as a significantly younger person who still found joy and wonder in the world and watch nerdy friends rise above their potential, watch the unlikely hero save everyone, watch young kids fall in love for the first time, watch a mother fight for her child no matter how crazy she looks, watch a sheriff find redemption, watch that horrifying monster that is somehow comforting because he represents every other monster you've ever seen, watch the bad guys lose.It didn't answer all the questions brought about through the season, and your not quite sure the bad guys are finished but I hope that's because they plan on bringing along a second season. Remember the pure magic of seeing a film for the first time before you discovered the internet and found out that everything was flawed and could see hundreds of people point out every tiny mistake? That's what this series was like for me. I was so enthralled I forgot to be rating and judging it and I just went along for the ride."
1201,"I admit, I was a bit skeptical during the first episode of this series, but nevertheless, this sci-fi gem began to shine brighter and brighter as the story progressed. Stellar performances by every actor from seasoned veterans, Winona Ryder (Joyce), David Harbour (Chief Hopper) and Matthew Modine (Dr. Brenner). However it was the younger actors who stole the show. Kudos to Caleb McLaughlin (Lucas), Noah Schnapp (Will), the lovable Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) and my favorites; the very talented Finn Wolfhard (Mike) and Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven).I cried like a baby during the climatic *ending*. I groaned when I saw Natalia Dyer (Nancy) with Joe Keery (Steve) instead of Charlie Heaton (Jonathan) and now that I know there's a strong possibility of a sequel to Stranger Things, I am hoping this romance goes my way! Bravo to Netflix for delivering, yet again, a brilliant show worth my time."
1202,Eleven can't act for nuts. So stiff and one dimensional. What's the big hooha about her recently abt her works. Don't get it.
1203,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***I watched the first season, chapter after chapter, waiting for it to get better. I kept feeling like I was watching an old movie, you know, like when you watch an old movie and giggle at the effects and styles used.Saw the lovely reviews it got and kept expecting something exciting to happen. It's very predictable and a bit boring. I ended up playing on my phone waiting for something to happen.If you're looking for some thrills and excitement, look for something else."
1204,"OK I rated this a 4 only because I think it's getting way too high a rating so I wanted to balance it out. It's probably worth a 6 or 7 at most. But definitely not nearly a 10. There is a great deal of hysteria going on over this show and not a lot of actual critical thought. First of all, yes it's a cute story but it's extremely derivative (i.e. it's stealing all it's ideas from other places including but not limited to Asian sci fi horror flicks) and often trite & clunky. The dialogue is cheesy & stilted at times and some of the acting is appalling. In particular WINONA RYDER!! What has happened to her? She was unwatchable at times her over-acting was so irritating. Fortunately, tho I was tempted to quit watching half way through due to Ryder & some other actors terrible acting, I stuck with it and simply skipped over most of Winona's scenes. As it turned out this made no difference to the story line and made the whole viewing experience so much better. If you want to do the same thing you just have to be careful - there are a couple of important bits with her in them & they are watchable enough because her dialogue in them is limited. Anyway - I think it's a fun series to watch but try not to expect too much even tho the ridiculously high rating tempts you to do just that. Also watch out for Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. Her performance alone is worth sticking with the show for. She is brilliant & manages to save the show from being pretty mediocre. Girl has a big future ahead of her.So anyway - do watch it! It's fun, has a nice 80's vibe & a cool 80's soundtrack (for the most part) but just don't get misled by the current hysterical popularity of the show. It's not as good as the ratings suggest, it's just enjoying a lot of buzz & hype, much like Pokemon Go. It's a shame really because my overly high expectations ruined it for me I think."
1205,"There are other series that deserves great popularity, why dis show?"
1206,"Season 1 was amazing, season 2 was alright, season 3 was garbage"
1207,"I honestly don't understand why people are saying that season 2 was tolerable and 3 was unnecessary. Dude they didn't close the gate in the first season so season2 was quite necessary and talking about season 3, at that time cold war was going on between America and Russia so that's obvious that after knowing about the gate the Russians would have definitely tried to imitate the action to help theirselves so if America would attack they would have enough defence. So there's definitely no problem about the evil russian concept. Only thing I didn't like in the show is that Dustin saved dart even when he knew that it was from the upside down it would be the same, but if it didn't happen then steve and company would not have been alive!! I rate it 9.7 or 9.8 not less!"
1208,"The first two seasons are top of the shelf TV, the 80s feeling is unforgettable and nostalgic, even if you didn't live that decade yourself."
1209,The chemistry between mike and eleven was next level. Waiting for next season
1210,"At first I hated stranger things because of how popular it was until I watched it myself, it's really good and one of my many favourite series that I have watched. Hopefully season 4 is as good as season 1-3"
1211,"I've always been more of a movie type of guy, but Stranger Things is the show that got me into watching TV series in the first place! It's full of amazing, endearing characters portrayed by very talented actors, it has a lot of heart and it's simply the type of show that makes you want to wrap yourself in a blanket and binge it all day. Perhaps its greatest strength, though, is the incredible world-building and the way the creators managed to captures 80's nostalgia. It's without a doubt one of the best shows on Netflix, and I can't wait to watch Season 4!"
1212,I like this show. Season1 10/10 season 2 8/10 season 3 9/10
1213,"I LOVE those small-town mysteries with the kids solving it and all the drama and stuff. It's REALLY good.I'll say this: The seasons start to get worse as they go on.
Season 1 is AMAZING. Easy 9-10/10. Really, really good.
Season 2 is pretty good too. Lots of fun moments, but not as good as the first one. Also there's that section where it really wants to be a CW show for like 2 episodes, but just ignore those episodes because they suck. Oh and Maxine is the worst character ever. I hate her guts.
Season 3 I didn't finish because it didn't seem very good. All the zing and the magic and mystery of the first season is lost. And the whole ""I dump your ass"" thing is incredibly stupid. Some little miscommunication and Eleven goes all feminism because the plot wants her to.Anyway that sounded like a rant. Please watch the first two seasons. You'll love it. It's really, really, really good."
1214,"Stranger Things is a Scifi Horror show about a group of kids whose friend goes missing. Over time, they figure out he is stuck in another dimension called the Upside Down. There are several monsters in this world that terrorize the kids, and their family members. The show is most likely my all time favorite show, and I have considered rewatching it. The show has so many genres mixed together, and gives off a really nice 80s vibe. It's hard not to like it. I don't want to say more because I do not want to spoil anything that happens in season three. All I'm gonna say is you should catch up before season 4 releases."
1215,"Personally I might be biased considering this is one of my favorite TV shows, but I think the show is very well done. I mean for me it hits all the marks, it combines sci-fi and horror with combined elements of romance and comedy, with good production, acting, costumes etc. The combination of practical effects mixed with CGI is pretty incredible and just the little details the Stranger Things team made are very cool. Also don't forget it was set in the 80's and I think it's pretty accurate to the time period, the Duffer Brothers and other people on the shows team have gone as far to buy prop pieces from the 80's and layer effects on the show to make it look like it was filmed in the 80's. Over all really done. If you have a chance watch the show, I highly recommend."
1216,No matter what are all saying about this series but i watch this & i loved this.A Must watch series of netflix waitng for season 4 now
1217,"Extremely good, that's everything to say about it. The series is exciting and funny at the same time. I personally felt like I was part of the cast! And you get to see the different and talented characters growing up. I could tell a lot more, but you should form your own opinion about this great series while watching it!"
1218,I just realized that this series is a children program after saw the entire season i am shocked especially season 3 was awesome
1219,"Amazing show with every element such as horror, comedy, Sci-fi and thrill...."
1220,"I don't understand the conformity when it comes to certain tv shows. Just because some people think it's a great show does not mean it is. People need to think for themselves. This show is just ok in my opinion. The acting is subpar, but the CGI is pretty good."
1221,Love Stranger Things. All the acting is top-notch.
1222,I love Stranger Things but I'm disappointed.The first season is really good and I really like the part in season two about Eleven's journey to find her peers. It was a step forward but they took a step backward in season three.Everything stays just the same. The story is tasteless. There is a monster and the kids kill it. The only thing that keeps me watching it is the charm of the characters.
1223,"This series is set in '80s Hawkins, Indiana. As it opens twelve year old friends Will Byers, Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson and Lucas Sinclair are playing Dungeons and Dragons. Shortly afterwards Will vanishes; he has been taken to 'The Upside Down'; a dark parallel universe. Around the same time a mysterious girl, known as Eleven (shortened to El), turns up. It later becomes apparent that she has telekinetic powers and is being looked for by workers at a secretive facility. As the story progress's Will's friends befriend El and she helps them try to find him. His mother is convinced that he is trying to communicate with her.I've only described the basic plot of season one; the second and third seasons follow on with new, but related stories with most of the same characters and some new ones.I really enjoyed this series from the start of the first season to the end of the third. Perhaps it was because I was in my early teens in the early eighties I really enjoyed the nostalgia factor despite the fact that I was growing up in rural Oxfordshire not small town America... of course I was watching American films like ET and late '50s set 'Stand By Me'. The group of friends in this particularly reminded me of the boys in the latter of those films. The story provides some good scary moments and a great atmosphere with threats that are a combination of fantasy and sci-fi... creatures beautifully mirroring the Dungeon and Dragon monsters in the game the boys play. The characters are great; most obviously the boys, Eleven, Will's mother Joyce and Jim Hopper, the town's sheriff. The cast is really good; the youngsters are really great making their characters believable even during the most fantastical of scenes. Millie Bobby Brown particularly stands out as Eleven; a character that is both vulnerable and at times potentially dangerous. The adult cast is impressive too. The effects, an impressive mix of CGI and physical effects, impressively bring the more supernatural elements of the film to life. Overall I'd certainly recommend this series to fans of the genre... I can't wait for season four."
1224,"This is an excellent show! I started watching it, and I liked it since the first episode. I loved the casting, the storyline, and everything. Actually, it's one of the best shows I've watched."
1225,The next season will be completely in Russian. Uchite russkii yazik)
1226,"It took me a few episodes to get into this show and I'm not normally big on sci-fi. I think the show is slightly overrated, but good nonetheless. Loveable characters, great acting and an enjoyable all round show"
1227,"I don't get the Harbour let-down.He was so good the first season.I anticipated his shaved horn in Hell Boy.He completely changed his acting.I think he did a caricature,It ruins everything.I guess the only reason Winona didn't end up like David is because the writing for her is better.He seems completely confused about what he's supposed to be doing. I bet he'll agree with this in a few years."
1228,"Season 1 and 2 were great. 10 stars
Season 3 2 stars for POOR Cheap and Political Script Writing.
This WAS a series to promote and recommend to others.Just finished Season 3 and What a let down!
They went from Quebec production and standards to gutter language and immoral ideals, like it was forced from Hollywood but filed in Georgia.It originally promoted kids growing us in real life but Strange occurances.
Kids do not have to be forced to this stereotype. What Poor writing for Season 3Forced pushing lesbian relationship , WHY?
Forced using Jesus Christ in vain,, WHY?
Forced using God Damn ,, WHY?
Forced using adultery with a mother and a boy ,, WHY?NONE of the above Added to the story, it definitely degraded the Values of Season 1 and 2Season 3 talks about corruption by government but the real corruption was the series Values using political agenda NOT from the time period 1980's.
Grow up Hollywood, this was such a great series, for you to force writers to such low brow, stereotypical, crap.
It appears as the stars pay increased by more than 10 times per episode , that the quality of Writing Got REAL CHEAP."
1229,May they stop these teenagers stuff and turn their eyes to a good story with something you come out with it!!
1230,"This show is a sausage fest. The 4 female characters that are actually interesting exist as appendages to their male counterparts. They are incapable of completing tasks of their own autonomy, or of having character development separate from each of their respective male love interests. They are boring, underdeveloped, and watered down. Duffer Brothers, please get out of the house and talk to any woman ever."
1231,"Seriously, this is considered excellent story telling? I grew up in the 1970s and 1980s and the children filmed during that time were more fleshed out.First of all, Ryder and Harbour are excellent adult actors in this film. Their tone strike a reasonable chord. The teenagers are actually fine in this as well. Not caricatures, but real individuals and it is good to see that one character (who could easily have been a throwaway boyfriend) is actually essential to the plot and a great character.The kid actors who are the anchors of the film? Let's be real. They are so-so. The one standout is the kid with the true facial disorder. Now HE'S the best 1980's kid. Obnoxious, but loyal. Lucas, the African-American next door neighbor? Obnoxious, but also disloyal, questioning, disrespectful...The other two males---mildly interesting. Eleven (the girl)? I understand she has to play her character and Milly plays it great, but the character is disrespectful to the adult who is trying to protect her. And then what kind of characters are Max and her stepbrother? Useless additional characters.Don't get me wrong. I don't think everything is terrible in Stranger Things. But EACH year could have been tidied up in 3 or 4 episodes. Ryder, Harbour, and even Modine in the first season, give top-notch performances. I just wish we could root for the child actors more than what we're seeing---"
1232,"Daaaaaang. Stranger things may just be the greatest television show of all time. So many things are overrated and over-hyped that I almost given up all hope about buzz and cr$p like that. But so many people told me about it and finally I pulled the trigger on the first season about a week before the release of season two and then literally binge watched season two in one day. Nine hours of awesome. Season one is, of course, slightly better but just by a few hairs. I hope they end it on season three. I just want them to conclude it before the quality drops."
1233,"like the younger generations are expecting a piece de la resistance. Spoiler...it's not, it's purposely flawed in just the right way. The fact you don't get that means this isn't something for you and that's OK. I lived through the 80s being a 40 something and this is spot on and is much better than those movies in writing, directing and acting. I view it as one of the best things to come out of Netflix another would be Sense 8. You cast your opinions, me I'm going to do the same and rave about this. In my eyes it is that good. My estimation based off some of these comments would hate on movies like Heathers, Weird Science, Aliens, Beetleguise and the like. Not their decade so they don't get it."
1234,"From my output on TV series has always remained low because I do not watch TV series ever,but this was a Netflix series,so that's different,because they have all the episodes provided all in order. Anyway,I started watching the first episode and I was getting really interested,and I was like screw it,right? I'm going to watch the entire season(but that was also because I had nothing to watch). While I was watching it,it was like in the middle of the night,I was still wide awake,but usually when I stay awake during stuff I like,it just means I'm into it. I got through the entire season,I was impressed plus heart warmed too. I was actually not expecting a lot from this series. It most of all impressed me by how science fiction and scary it was,that was another reason why I watched it. But what also got me interested was that they added connections in the series to make it also a type of emotional series as well. When I watched this series,I was just expecting a lot from what I don't really care about series,which is long time get to the point type of stuff. Stranger things is a type of series that doesn't mess around,they get to the point and they just basically have everything I wasn't actually expecting out of this,and what I didn't expect is what I was impressed by. And that's what I loved about this series. It was scary,science fiction,and sad too.When I got done with the series,I just said can't wait for season 2,and I said it with a lot of meaning too. I really can't wait to see what happens next. In the mean time,I just continue to watch season 1 to keep me busy."
1235,"I am a 90s baby so I had yet to discover Winona Ryder and her awesomeness. Recently I watched a movie called Honeybee that I loved and it was inspired by Heathers which I then watched and I became obsessed! I started watching this show just for Winona Ryder and I loved her in it! I ended up loving everyone in this however, and I felt like I was watching the baby of ET and Heathers put together. The whole cast is so amazing and I can't get enough of the friendships with the kids. I can't say much more without including spoilers but I have a lot of hope for how they ended it, maybe its not quite so dark after all? I don't know but I do know I love Winona Ryder and discovering her and glad she made a comeback and I can't wait to watch the next season."
1236,"What made me curious about stranger things is not about the hype. I've only read this once or twice somewhere from browsing the internet but the appeal it has on my geek senses really told me to watch this. Truly a hidden masterpiece over hundreds of TV series nowadays. It has this nostalgic feeling when you're a 90's or 80's kid and if you're also a fan of reading books, you could just almost imagine how the book will be like. The kid inside everyone may be related to any character in the series and the cinematography is just amazing. When you are alone at night, where everything is quiet and you feel like you wanna go for a time travel or immerse in a new world... Stranger Things delivers that feeling. Good job Duffer Brothers! Please don't screw up those upcoming seasons."
1237,"Stranger Things an ambitious project by the Duffer Brothers finally brought to life by Netflix after being rejected by every single network approached deserves the feverish viral status it has received. As a 32 year old I avidly watch Game of Thrones, Sherlock and many other shows which many consider to be the best of the decade but none have moved me so far as Stranger things has. In an amazing story line the Duffer brothers make you glue your eyes to the screen and hurriedly click next episode as soon as one finishes. While managing to bring three different stories with 3 unique genre styles the show manages to embrace you for 8 sweet hours before gently laying you back into the real world feeling anguished that you cannot relive it again. Despite loving shows like Band of Brothers, Breaking Bad never before has a show been so gripping that I would watch it 2 in a row in the space of 3 days. Even while writing this I feel the need to go back to Netflix and watch it again. Acting and filmography are top notch with absolute stellar from the main actors who are children which is extremely rare nowadays. It was also an added pleasure to see Winona Ryder return to the screen anchoring this show with top notch acting. If I could rate this show higher than 10/10 I would as I know this will most likely stay in my top ten go to shows for suggestions for a long long time."
1238,"Stranger Things is a sci-fi horror series on Netflix created by the Duffer Brothers (Wayward Pines). I had been hearing nothing but praise for this eight part series from friends and family, and now I know why. It is a clever tribute to movies and TV series of the 80s.In the small town of Hawkins, Indiana, in the year 1983, 12-year-old Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) mysteriously disappears one night. Will's mother Joyce (Winona Ryder), police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour), and his three friends Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) set out to search for where he could have gone. To make matters more complicated, a strange girl with psychokinetic powers is discovered by Will's friends the following day. Could she hold the key to where Will may have vanished?The series plays out as an affectionate homage to all the stereotypes and tropes of 1980s films such as E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial, Stand By Me and The Lost Boys. The theme song itself sounds like something composed by Director John Carpenter. I really enjoyed the sense of mystery and suspenseful atmosphere that was emanating throughout each episode. I must give credit to the Duffer Brothers for the way they were able to capture the overall feel of an 80s movie. The acting was great as well, especially from all of the child actors and Winona Ryder. I just hope the series will be picked up for a second season.I rate the first season 8.5/10."
1239,"That isn't a Stephen King series!!!!I was actually shocked that the great author wasn't involved in this show, everything about it SCREAMS Stephen King!The opening title is font from his paperbacks and there are references to his books through out from fear of clowns to the books actually making cameo! The style will remind you of the mini-series for the book (IT).... A lot!I generally don't like child actors but the Duffer brothers made it work! The series is set in the 80's with all the geeky references from your childhood, the one thing they got ""wrong"" was using modern music sometimes, I think it's a subtle reminder that you are indeed watching something new. Once you start watching you'll get hooked! it's impossible not to! A good thriller with an intense story line, believable dialogue and interesting characters.This is probably more Stephen King then his actual work!"
1240,"The setting, the characters, the actors, the background score, the story, the writing and the pacing everything is almost perfect. This is what a true thriller should be and NETFLIX keep doing the good work by green lighting such shows. Those 4 Kids are gems, we should be seeing more of them. Not a single moment across 8 episodes is boring. I binge watched all the episodes today. I mean I watched 8 episodes in 10 hrs I took 2 breaks in between like an hr each. Duffer brothers maintain the quality in 2nd season as well I am sure Netflix will soon give a green light to the next season. I wanted to give it a 9.3, since IMDb allows only whole number ratings and I didn't want to give it a 9 so I gave it a 10. Must watch."
1241,"With it's 80's setting and combination of both Steven Spielberg & Stephen King, this show was phenomenal. The acting all around is phenomenal, especially from Winona Ryder, David Harbour, & the kid actors. The Duffer Brothers is a phenomenal job of capturing the spirit of the 80's in this show. If you haven't watched this show, I highly recommend that you should go and watch it."
1242,"Stranger Things is one of the best tv shows that I have watched. It is mysterious, dramatic, at times scary and has a great cast to work with. Millie Bobby Brown and Noah Schnapp are probably two of the most talented teen actors of all time. No one can play Eleven and Will like they do. Season one had an incredible story and I was honestly shocked when I saw episode 3: Holly, Jolly where they brought out Wills body from the lake. It was at that point where I could not stop watching the show! Season 2 was a step up with the action and the CGI which was incredible. Season 3 is a controversial season, but I still think I was great despite the mixed reviews it's gotten. It adds an essences of comedy and gore to the show that fits in perfectly with a super dramatic ending with hoppers letter. I can't wait for season 4!"
1243,Season 3 was very good and a new characters and we see the old characters like steav and Arika good characters and influence and a new monster and new story... The Russians want to open the gate again and not like the other season demogorgin and the gate open with itself
1244,"What's so amazing about this? It's just an average show with average drama, average action, average thriller! The only good episode was the Finale!"
1245,"Absolutely awesome. The first season had my head spinning. The 2nd had me out of my seat cheering then almost sobbing. The 3rd was Dacre Montgomery's season. Great cast, great storylines with each season building on the last the way a show should make you feel."
1246,"I can't say enough about the acting,directing,writing the look of the show is just incredible!"
1247,"Season 3 is the first ever 10/10 I have ever given for anything, it was truly amazing. After season 2 i thought how the hell do they follow that? But they absolutely smashed it and i cannot wait for season 4."
1248,"From the first episode of this show ...it's been an amazing, thrilling and sometimes heartbreaking journey for both ,the ones in the show and the ones who are watching the show!!
The 3rd season was for me the best season so far and I am already very excited and can't wait for the 4th season. This show is the best show I have ever seen!!
Hats off Duffer Brothers for giving us such an Amazing show!! Hope season 4 is even better!!"
1249,"I'm a child of the 80s, and I loved the first season. Lost my faith on the 2nd, but now they've tuned down the horror (ok, only 3 episodes in), tuned UP the 80s, and I'm a believer. Funnier and pure fun. Thank you."
1250,"I certainly don't watch drama, thriller type of thing. But the first time I saw this show, I was like. Meh, Okay this has a good rating so I tried and give it a try to watch it, and oh man, I can't stand up on my chair and dare to pause it. The thing about this show is giving you the 80's vibe. In which case, I didn't have a chance to feel it and this show gave me what it is to be like in the 80's. Partying, playing in the outside rather than browsing on the internet all that playing games on the phone, computer all that. I was born in '98 and didn't have a chance what it's feel like. This show is so worth every penny. I just wish that it will be a long season but I doubt it since the storyline is focus on 1 thing and few things. I have a feeling that next season will be all about finding new psychic friends. But, I gotta tell you THIS SHOW IS GOOD AND DESERVE A PERFECT 10 RATING, 100% ROTTEN TOMATOES OR EVERY CRITIC REVIEW. You gotta watch it. Seriously, Just.watch.it.If you think that the season 2 is bad because of eleven's show time it's because she is not the focus of the story. It's Will's. It's not like the show didn't gave a cliffhanger on the 1st season ending. He surely suffered enough and the season 3 is not about Will again. Also, It's not meant for everybody, whether you like it or not. We all have our own opinion, but giving the non-sense reason why you didn't like the show is st**id."
1251,"I watched one review of this series which said something to the effect that they were trying to get the ""feel"" of a 1980s Spielberg/King/Carpenter movie. IF that's what they were trying to do, they succeeded. However, I can't help but feel I've lost 8 hours of my life that I'll never get back. Poorly written. Found myself being bored more often than not. Matthew Modine... What for? Winona Ryder... What for? Their lackluster performances could've been brought to life by unknowns so much better. There are things that happen in this series that normal, rational people just wouldn't do which just kills it for me. Case in point. Nancy is out in the woods with Jonathan and decides to go into the tree through to the other dimension without waiting for Jonathan... WRONG! The acting is poor throughout the series and the overacting by Ms. Ryder. If a book dragged on this long? They've taken 8 episodes to drag out what should've been covered in 4. Enough said."
1252,I LOVE THIS SHOW 😘😍I WATH ALL SEASON IN 3 DAYS. IT'S AWESOME 👌👌
1253,"Season 2 was absolute crap and I gave up half way through season 3. If you REALLY need to watch this, DO NOT GO BEYOND SEASON 1.Trust me, you'll have hours of your life back you can do something more worthwhile with"
1254,"The amount of fun I've had watching stranger things cannot be quantified. I fell in love with the characters in season 1 and it's been so fun watching them grow up through each new chapter. This is absolutely THEE most creative television show I've ever seen. It is full of thrills and insane monsters that just keep getting more and more epic with each season. You won't want to stop watching this once you start! Every episode just grips you and you find yourself dying to know what is going to happen next! The acting is amazing and quite comical! I love that it is set in the 80s- the whole thing is done so well and I REALLY cannot wait for the fourth season to come out already! If you haven't seen stranger things I truly feel bad for you. You are missing out on such a creative and fun story, and one of the best tv shows of all time! Go watch it now!"
1255,"It's a shame...I loved Season 1, they nailed everything, from the nostalgia to cinematography, to a little, mysterious story, kept small through the disbelief of the city...but the sequels just couldn't keep the story low-key and that comes with a huge loss for the overall quality and vibe of the series...Go ahead and watch Season 1, but k
treat is like it has no second season..."
1256,"This show is so boring, didn't keep me interested. Winona Ryder was good and the cop guy, but the kid actors are sort of annoying and cliche. There's nothing tense about this show, it feels more like a kid show. The demogorgons are not that scary, at least not the way they are portrayed here. If we are to compare 80s style Sci-fi's, The Thing or Outer Limits... much better concepts."
1257,"Cheap Netflix is one of those studios that forces you to sit though long trailers of their movie offerings. Anyway, can we say ""uncreative ripoff""? I could list at least dozens of reasons why, but will only do a few. 
Series demographics is for the middle school to the barely graduated high school set. 
The following ""usual"" means storyline hooks been done countless times before - simple cheap formula to sell and make money for producers, et al. 
1. Usual dysfunctional family; single parent raising a mix of kids. Lots of age inappropriate smoking; drinking; fake underage sex; language ""don't be a pussy"". 
2. Usual local constable w/issues such as addictions (smoking, drinking, being independently 'ornery) to come to single mom's help.
3. Usual gang of middle schoolers bullied by bigger baddies (but payback is on the horizon of course). 
4. Usual cute girl romances for the schoolers. Usual nerdy science teacher. Usual schoolers out to solve the missing peoples puzzle despite initial push back from dull clueless adults. Usual biking on dark roads w/woods of course. 
5. Usual secret quarantine lab in small town w/baddie corporate research w/baddie secret government help. Lab is trying to create super humans (of course), and then there has to be an alien supernatural portal for our usual menace. Usual EEG device as cheap visual for altering/measuring brain.
6. Usual superpower tricks such as telekinesis (levitating, opening/closing things, pushing things about) w/usual bleeding nose. 
7. Cheap special effects such as flashing on/off lights; falling snow/ash; bluish lighting; blobby & webby things on walls; critter hand/face coming through wall (which is just stretchy fabric); shadowy figures; flashing across screen figure; blurry images; same-old-same-old critter w/usual big flappy mouth (I'ld like to be his agent). 
8. Lots & lots of screen time devoted to just scenes of talking heads (people just talking about nothing special or intelligent) - cheap filler. 
9. Acting, dialogue all TV level quality. Left enough unresolved for another season."

1260,"Stranger Things is the latest Netflix Original to take the world by storm and from what I heard of the show before I watched it I could guess why. From reviews it sounded like it was damn near perfect, an original concept with great writing, a well known actress leading the helm with some talented new faces thrown into the mix, and overall great direction and visuals. It sounded too good to be true and unfortunately it was, I strapped into the first two episodes ready to have my mind blown and came out the other end with my mind very much intact as I scratched it and wondered where I had saw this show before. To my dismay Stranger Things is not an original concept by any means, in fact it is the exact opposite of an original concept. Every single thing in show has been borrowed from every piece of media based in the 80's or classic sci-fi. At first it would seem as though Stranger Things merely pays homage to these classics and that would all be fine if that was the case but it's made painfully obvious the this show blatantly steals things from other pieces of media. The Twilight Zone, The X-Files, Goonies, E.T, Alien, a literal exact shot from Stand By Me, the list goes on. The reason no one notices this is the show blinds it's viewers with 80'S nostalgia forcing constant references and throwbacks so viewers will be saying ""hey Risky Business! I remember that movie!"" instead of ""Didn't they do something like this in an episode of Outer Limits?""This forcing of 80's pop culture also distracts the watcher from just how bad the writing is. The story holds up simply because it takes the best elements from other stories instead of actually coming up with their own spin on things but the rest of the writing seems sloppy. Dialogue can be hit or miss, sometimes it's perfectly fine, other times it's either really unnatural or just plain boring. Characters are in a similar situation, some are interesting, realistic and a joy to watch, others are bland, or in the case of Mike and Nancy's family, only exist when it's convenient. Not to mention the constant inconsistencies like how Eleven has no idea about the concept of friends or time yet she doesn't question teachers, bullies or anything else that happens in school or even the concept of school itself. She knows not to kill or hurt the school bully yet when she killed or hurt in the facility she was given affection.The direction is OK, it's not exactly bad but nothing really stands out about it either it captures the feel of the 80's well enough and establishes the tone but other than that visually the show is quite boring with a few exceptions. The music fits the tone perfectly and builds tension but just like everything else in the show it's pretty much a rehash of every sci-fi theme ever, like X-files or Twilight Zone.The show does have one stand out though and that's the acting. Every single actor gives it their all and I mean their all. Winona Ryder plays her part of the anxious mother who everyone thinks is crazy but really knows what's actually going on perfectly. David Harbour is so interesting as Police Chief Hopper and is easily my favourite character to watch, he is the character with the most depth and Harbour's acting talent really does show how troubled and determined Hopper is. The child actors also deserve a shout out because not only are they not terrible they're actually some of the best actors in the show. Even the poorly written characters like Nancy are acted well and make the dialogue and writing much more bearable, making it so I could actually get past the first two episodes and continue with the series.In the end, Stranger Things is just OK, it has quite a few redeeming qualities but it also has a lot of flaws. Really the worst thing about it is just how insulting it is to it's audience and how little effort has gone into something that is getting so much praise. Watch it if you like classic sci-fi and want to see an updated take on some of your favourite tropes but make sure to turn off your brain and not take it too seriously, just have fun with it.. But if you really want a homage to classic sci-fi done masterfully then I would suggest you look elsewhere, probably to Super 8.The real strange thing is how what should be just a fun, cheesy cult sci-fi show has somehow tricked everyone into thinking it's the next Breaking Bad."
1261,"Well, i've never written a review here nor am I an expert at this genre but all day I have been thinking, by God, this was such an incredible series and experience. Captivating, creepy and fun sci-fi horror.. this is really groundbreaking for a debut by two brothers.The acting was so on-point as well as the set designs, story and action.The point that sticks with me most right now has to be one of the last scenes that mirrors most of what we are all thinking at the end. One month after this horror, the kids are playing their D&G game again, this time, they know to fireball monster out of experience and that it is, defeated. ""Woah, that's it?"" - exclaims one. ""The campaign was too short"" - cries another. ""It was 10 hours long"" - replies the game master ""It doesn't make any sense."" ""what about the lost knights?"" ""..and the proud princess?"" ""And those weird flowers in the cave?!"" ""I don't know, it's...."" And they are all interrupted.That is the genius of this series. It mirrors our thoughts right now. ""Just 8 episodes?"", ""What about the girl?"", What about the future? What about the cover-ups? Does everybody know?And you know, that is the genius of fantasy and the genius of the story writing. There it is, right there. It is a fantasy and it just... damn... works well when told in the most spectacular, impressive, engaging story and experience.Stranger Things absolutely nailed it."
1262,"(I didn't include a synopsis because they're everywhere)When I first saw the trailer for this show a few weeks back, I immediately thought of R.L Stine and Stephen King. But also for some god forsaken reason I thought of Earth to Echo, so I was very conflicted on what my prior thoughts were. Without a doubt I came into this show very skeptical. As soon as I watched the first 10 minutes of episode 1, I knew I was in for a treat.The first thing that struck me as I was watching it was the direction. Straight from the get go, I felt as if I was watching a movie. From the amazing cinematography to the incredible set pieces, I honestly forgot I was watching a show until the hard cut to credits. The characters were something I was always on the fence with. I kept going back and fourth from saying ""Yeah man, good for you!"" and ""What the hell is wrong with you?"". It took me up until the third episode to really get conformable with the main cast and crew, but once I hit that point I began to adore all of them. Surprisingly my favorite character by the end was Nancy, the uptight older sister of Michael.The story is so genuine and so unique there is almost nothing I would change. Except one thing, the main antagonist. They never fully disclose their driving force to do what they do, and what their ultimate goal is. However that's not a huge issue, and hopefully they'll go more into it in season 2.Stranger Things was more than just a new show to binge on Netflix, it was an experience. I don't want that to sound like an excuse to watch it. This show was truly a great piece of art in the cinematography medium. I highly recommend this show to anyone who wants to be surprised."
1263,"I found the series very predictable. But, what was unpredictable was how good it felt, because the plot treatment was mesmerizing. The cinematography was playing mind games with the viewer and the editing completely helped to be involved in the show. The kids were believable and reminded us of why childhood was so important. The show made me feel like another character in the plot. All actors were just bada$$. The music was the favourite thing for me. Special mentions to the 2 newcomers. Great job! Netflix is on a roll and Shawn Levy, great project.Some pointers though: expecting better CGI next time. Winona was used lesser than I thought. She needed more screen time."
1264,"It is a loving homage to everything great about eighties movies, but done in subtly enough way as to not be off putting. There are smart kids, young love, bike chases, flickering lights, 'suits,' and amazing creature work. Is there really much more that you could ask for?There are converging story lines, flawed yet relatable characters, and so much more.This show held up better than I ever could have expected. I have so much more I could say but this is a circumstance where going in blind will make your experience that much better, so I'll hold my tongue.Don't read any reviews, don't watch any trailers, just go watch it. The first eight minutes will win you over."
1265,"I will admit, I spent so much time refusing to watch this show simply because I thought it was over-hyped. But when my sister took over our living room to play an episode, I slowly got more and more immersed and by the end of that episode I said ""I have to watch this!"" And by golly is is WORTH EVERY BIT OF HYPE IT GETS!
The characters in this show are incredible. The actors are so young and yet their chemistry is unbelievable. The interactions of every character feel natural and not forced, the humor is genuinely funny. Every character has their own little quirks that make me adore them, and their personalities work so well together to create a ideal group. And the character growth is admirable.
And the plot line...HOW INCREDIBLE! The plot is clear and concise but manages to stay fully gripping and holds my attention every second!
And this show makes me feel so many things. I've laughed, cried, held my breath during tense moments, screamed, gasped, and even after the credits appear it leaves me reeling over the events of the episode. Every episode only left me wanting more. Every single little thing about this show is absolutely amazing. If I could, I'd give it 100/10 stars.Do yourself a HUGE favor and watch this if you haven't already."
1266,"We really appreciated first season, 10/10, nice the idea and all the characters and stuff. But second, and in particular third, seasons are not worth as much, maybe not even worth to be seen The third..."
1267,"I'm not joking! Watch it, and you'll see...
There is a not a single bad episode in this show, and it is very riveting and epic. It's like 80's movies meet Stephen King."
1268,I love the series and I have seen it again and again and I love it - hope it will continue
1269,It's the best show I have ever seen so far. I really recommend it.
1270,"Mu daughter and I love watching. It's our thing to do together.
I love the story line, I admire 11"
1271,"The first two seasons of Stranger things really set the plot well and gets you hooked immediately. Set in the 1980's, the actors portray what it was like in these times to perfection bringing out nostalgia of the time.It is not so often that a hit series will feature children as the lead characters, which is another reason as to why Stranger Things is so highly rated among viewers. It is a show which is unique and provides Netflix the opportunity to continue the very interesting storyline."
1272,Ine of the most mysterious and suspenseful series ever made
1273,"Awesome characters, great story, great balance between drama and action, love the humour in the series.... In my opinion it is a must watch."
1274,I was not into this show at first. I didn't want to watch it because of all the hype. But when I got hooked when I started watching it.
1275,It's just awesome the story revolves around 80's and it is very interesting
1276,"The first season of the Netflix original series ""Stranger Things"" consists of 8 episodes. It was released in 2016 created by the Duffer brothers. It is a story of a young boy named Will Byers who mysteriously disappears one night. And now his mother, a police chief and his group of friends are investing on his disappearance. They are trying to figure out what actually happened to him. The mother played by Winona Ryder is excellent in her performance. Police chief played by David Harbour who tries to find the missing boy by any means is good in his role. He was really good in this show as his character developed and progressed in these 8 episodes is very interesting to watch. I also might add that the three kids who are now searching for their friend Will are absolutely perfect in every aspect. They really lift up the show to a whole new level. The older brother of Will Byres played by Charlie Heaton is also excellent in the show. He has a very reserved character.
Now, the most important character in the whole series is the character of Eleven played by Millie Bobby Brown. So, Eleven a.k.a. El is easily the most intriguing character in the show. She is so compelling and her performance looks like an adult performance. She is definitely the best part of the show. Now among the kids that were searching for their friend, my favorite character is Dustin. This kid is so funny and so likable. And what I liked about these kids is their tied friendship. They have their own codes and most importantly they also have their own trust for each other.
It's an 80's story and also takes place in the 80's. I had a great time watching stranger things and I love the style of the show. This is so well made and very well cast too. It takes you to 80's in many ways. So many things happen in the show during each episode. You get to see secret agency, evil creatures, girl having superpowers and much more. I definitely recommend this show to you. The climax is very satisfactory and emotional. It was without a doubt one of the happiest endings of all time."
1277,A little disappointed by the season 3 but the first 2 seasons were absolutely great!
1278,"As someone who is a child of the 70s and teenager of the 80s of course this show will appeal to me as it harkens back to that nostalgic time. But I was and still a fan of the Marvel comics of both those decades. In fact some of the best writing in comics cam from that time period. In particular the Chris Claremont run on the X-men , which ran from the 70s to the 90s. 17 years of great storytelling. If you have red these comics before you can see the influence of the Phoenix on the Eleven character . Both the Jean Gray and the Rachel Summers versions of Phoenix. That feeling I got from reading those issues. That "" oh $#!t "" feeling is the same feeling I got while watching Eleven flex her telekinetic powers. That never came across in the X-Men movies. One could say that both actresses couldnt pull it off , but more I think , was the true understanding of the potential untapped telekinetic power could unleash. It's not enough to CGI ted eyes, fire and red veins. There is none of that in Elevens character and yet we can see and feel the power. Of course what hurt the X movies was that they became Wolverine movies and not movies about the X-men. That's what made the Claremont run so popular. It was about the team with other underlying stories about the individual X-men. The dark Phoenix Saga won multiple awards for it's writing. Let's just hope with The X-men back under the Marvel Banner we will finally get the X-men and the Phoenix we deserve."
1279,"Let me just start by saying, the first two seasons are great, the mystery and horror worked. What new can i say, everything that is great about them, has already been said. The show is worth it, just watch it.My main problem is the third season ( minor spoilers from here).
The plot is messy. It's trying to much. It wants to be an action comedy, body-cop drama. A horror and mystery show. They should decide which tone they want to use. It wants to try to much.
This results in a show, that tonely feels different.I can't say anything else, because it's great, the acting, cinematography, production value. The writing gets messy in the later seasons. This season lacks focus, decide which tone and tighten it up. Then the show will get back on track.
And the quality returns."
1280,"Season 1 and 2- great nothing to complain about
Season 3- the series receives suck a bad humour tone, with places where it isnt necessary at all, even in the most important moments i was feeling nothing, i wouldnt care even if eleven dies. Please dont do the same mistake on season 4."
1281,"7/10
The production is incredible. However, it just feel like a dull copy of what it THINKS Stranger Things is supposed to be. Dustin, Steve, and Robin stole this season without a doubt. I want a show with just them. Watch it, it is entertaining."
1282,"I'm just in season 1 and feeling that it has been to dragged out already. I think the main plot moves too slowly to my liking with to many side plots. I'm in episode 6 and I'm telling to myself "" I get the grief, I get the paranoia, get the emotions but please move on. For the sake of completion, I might finish this season and no more.The big plus is definitely the performances, specially all the child artists.... Wonderful job!!"
1283,"Season one pretty much nailed it. It even could have been made in the 80s. Seasons 2 and 3 are more like an 80s parody where much of the dark feel, magic, and mystery seen in season one are absent. The last two seasons have a lot of comedy and are fast paced. The gore in season 3 is over the top. Thank goodness Erica had a big role in this season. She brought back the childlike antics seen in season 1. And really, the season 3 story is about dating. I'm not sure who the intended audience is, but the multiple scenes of kids making out and having sex is wacked and none of the seasons pass the Bechdel test."
1284,"Such a great series what can i say everything about this show is good. The cast , The acting , The horror and mystery. Everything!It has such a great 1980's theme like Really good Camera and TV filters , it looks like a 1980 show with a high qualityThis show has only 17 episodes Season 1 has 8 and Season 2 has 9
With season 3 coming very soonSo i really recommend you watching it , because for me, i was addicted to the show from The first episodeYou won't regret watching this brilliant show , Totally one of my Top 5's"
1285,"I loved the characters, the cinematography, and especially the story. All of which felt right out of an essential 80's movie. Highly recommend is you like sci-fi plot lines or the wonderful time of the 80's."
1286,I do not see this as a horror.But a colorful entertainer with fun and feel good moments.Got so addicted
1287,"Some people say the show steal a lot of ideias from 80's major pop culture hits. Honnestly I dont care: i loved it. Its a time machine, one episode at a time. My generation, late 70's and 80's born and raised, will love it, for the nostalgia, and for the rich, lovable charaters, cared direction, impecable script. Thums um."
1288,What the heck happened to Barb?????? Seriously. This was the saddest thing about the show. Poor dependable Barb just seems to disappear and no one notices.
1289,Someone recommended this show to me. I was a bit skeptical because of the word (Stranger Things) I thought it was horror :0. But when I started watching this show I fell in Love instantly. It was not scary at all. I was like why didn't I started watching this before. This is a type of show that has you hooked. The story line is beautiful executed.. It makes you feel like your inside the show. Netflix did an amazing job!!
1290,"I watched all of the season in a week, I couldn't stop watching it! Still some unanswered questions and loving the endings that keep you hooked on it :) I recommend this highly! The acting is brilliant and it's based on kids which makes it more interesting!"
1291,"I was quite late to the party and started watching stranger things last September. It was the best thing I have ever done!!
From 80s nostalgia to amazing actors I was instantly hooked. Both seasons are phenomenal and Each episode is like watching a mini movie but better! Compared to other shows this one is definitely my favourite
You just can't go wrong with stranger things"
1292,Loved the way the story revolves.Excellcent Screenplay. Loved Dustin Character. Background Score is awesome.
1293,"This is a fantastic show, great acting!!! Amazing!!"
1294,No show can top this show I literally love this show
1295,It was a great show and i couldn't stop watching it. I loved it so much and all the characters are so amazing at acting. This show is definitely a great show to binge watch.
1296,"Extremely entertaining with a good mix of horror, fantasy and comedy. The plot is original, and a really well done to the Duffer brothers for bringing such an amazing story to life. I had seen the ads everywhere but was not very interested in watching the series but when i did it really blew me away. A definite watch. You are missing out if you don't. The kids play their part extremely well and i am anxiously awaiting season 3."
1297,"So far it's the best that I've watched in my entire life. 1. Memorable story Kinda bias. Good set up, I watch it without reading anything about it. Still, they perfecting it from other theory.2. Strong characters development Everyone plays their part well, none of them to me is irritating at all. I fell for them from time to time.3. Mysterious Keeping it simple and interesting.4. Nostalgic I really miss my childhood time after watching this. The environment, equipment, tools, etc that they have been using, it's so touching.5. Great actors I can't think of a bad one. I can imagine the children last time were smarter and brave.6. Perfect pacing I can't stop craving for more after end of each episode7. Perfect time line You'll know it after you watch it.8. Touching There are touching moment at the right time.9. The miss out 1 rating The imperfect is where it making it a whole.10. Better than any blockbuster movie I hope they never stop making seasons for stranger things."
1298,"I think there are a few 'second series' (and later) that are basically acceptable, but this is so good that it really needs to be condensed a little and put on the big screen. We all know that tangential deviations can become tedious, overworked, overused and basically excessive, but here they all tie together and actually compliment the overall experience. Winona is as great as ever, even better than the miserable version from season 1. Millie, who I just discovered in English, is amazing even though she is only 13 and has what can only be described as challenging. David is a pro, even though you want to feel sorry for him at times he holds on to the 'tough guy' persona! And whoever thought of Sean to be the geek was on their toes! An all round brilliant series and worthy of a view.."
1299,"This is a great show that started as a trending everywhere, but then you start falling in love with the characters, the lines and the story that you watch it in 1 day. I just love this show and I don't have enough words to give this a review... This is a MUST see show and you should totally don't seea any spoiler, so stay away from those spoilers that are everywhere."
1300,"This show has the very best of everything you loved from the 80's decade. Not just the movies but also the music, the literature, the games, etc.It has a lot of subplots and details, but the main story in the first season is the mysterious and strange vanishing of Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) and the struggle of his mother and friends on finding him, while a mysterious girl appears around the town, and the kids start thinking that these things may be related. The story has some of the best elements of the 80's horror, adventure and sci-fi films. You can find a bit of Alien, a bit of ET or The Goonies,a bit of of The Thing or Halloween, etc. For some this may be unoriginal and boring but for me it's a great throwback to all the great things that were created in the 80's.The cast is just perfect. Right now, I couldn't think of another actor/actress playing the role. The main four kids are Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Will (Noah Schnapp), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb MacLaughlin). They are really great and seeing their chemistry together on screen is one of the highlights of the show. Then there is this little girl, Eleven played wonderfully by Millie Bobby Brown. She gives one of the most powerful performances of the whole show and every time she appears on screen you can see how much talent this girl has. Then you have the more grown ups, from the adults, Chief Hopper (David Harbor) and Joyce (Winna Ryder)) who play their role perfectly, to the teens, Nancy (Natalia Dyer), Jonathan (Charlie Heathon) and Steve (Joe Keery). All the actors were really great in the show and the ones that appear in the second season are also really great but I won't say anything about them in order to not spoil it.The recreation of the 80's era is one of the best things of the show. You could watch the show again just to find those little details hidden in each scene, with maybe a poster from The Evil Dead or Jaws, or maybe a toy of ET or Yoda. The cinematography and the visuals also take you back to many of those classics from the 80's that you fell in love to when you watched it, and it will bring so many good memories about them. It also recreates the feeling of the kids going around with their bikes, going to the arcade, playing D&D, etc. The soundtracks is another good thing in the show. It has a fantastic collection of music, from The Clash or Scorpions to Tangerine Dream or vangelis. And also the fantastic electronic score created by two members of the electronic band S U R V I V E (Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein) who are able to recreate the sound of the 80's synths perfectly and juts from the opening theme you're introduced into this fantastic world.Definitely a must watch if you love a really great story with lovely characters, great visuals and a great soundtrack, all mixed in a big pack of 80's nostalgia."

1302,"Season One: This show is a great comeback to 80s nostalgia (see if you could catch all the references). This show seemed to be heavily inspired by creations from the 80s such as Steven Spielberg, Stephan King, and various others; it's beautifully packaged together to what becomes one of the greatest Netflix originals it could offer. It does have some flaws where it starts to feel like a rip-off after repeated references throughout, but it managed to keep you interested throughout this show. 9/10 for this season for me!Season Two: What a ride this season! Was on a binge the day it premiered and surprisingly, it's just as great as the first with a few exceptions. First of all, the Duffer brothers teased some information about this season on how it'll be ""bigger and darker"". In my opinion, I think this is where the writing got out of hand. With the introduction of the new characters, it nearly missed the charm from the first season. On the previous season, there's a much bigger threat with the involvement of the government and how the characters in Hawkins want to find this missing boy and see whether or not he's alive. With this kind of tension, the newer one feels a bit underwhelming. There's not much government conspiracy - or cover-up. Also, you hardly see the spider monster (Mind Flayer) who's threatening Will. Again, this is still a great season but the writing could've been better. Since the mention of this season getting darker, it seemed to me that most of the original cast seemed to have some plot armor. I think to make this much of a threat, I think it makes sense to kill off some of the original cast (at least one cause this ain't Game of Thrones). Besides, this is still a great watch but I felt that the tensions aren't set high enough. 7.5/10Overall, this is a great season if you loved the previous one. I personally think the writing for this got out of reach and some certain parts tend to be predictable. I'm still down for another season of Stranger Things and if you love this show, give it a shot!"
1303,"I am a huge fan of the 80, i was a teenager back then and watched a lot of TV, the A Team, pretty much everything Frank Lupo did was amazing Riptide, Knight Rider, the master, street hawk, werewolf and etc.I have not watch a series since the 80 to be very honest, i kind of got hooked on Arrow for a while until it failed into drama romantic bore fest.Stranger things is amazing in every part, there is not too much drama romance, the special effects are amazing for a TV series, great story pretty much feels like the movie The Mist, in fact it might have been better to do a Stephen King type of 4 hour blocs.I really hope they don't screw it up to make more money and go the boring drama story telling, 2 seasons should be enough to tell the whole story and then end it."
1304,"As it is very interesting, watching a few episodes will definitely get you hooked on the show. The background soundtrack and way they displayed it was well done, when I first started I really believed it was placed back in the year it was displayed. The characters are very good for their ages. I cannot wait until season 2.The new character they are going to put into the next season excites me in a way that they are planning to keep this show very much alive. The writer did a very good job with captivating and turning it into a show."
1305,"Well done Netflix. What a great series. I binge watched all the 8 episodes in one day and still wanted more. I am left wondering a lot of things after the final episode. I also have questions about Will's dog. I think there is something special there. Why was the dog in the house was when Will came bursting home and no one else was there at that time? Wow, what a fantastic cast. They all work together so beautifully. Some absolutely magic performances and I can see awards being won by this show and individuals in the cast. Millie Brown is a natural. A real special talent indeed. I was really taken by Millie's facial expressions. I must say that Matthew Modine played an outstanding slimy rat. I did not like his character the first time I saw him. Well done Matt. Not really wanting to single out any individuals from an equally terrific bunch, but I hope credit is given to great performers. I was just blown away with the 1980 props eg: that left over from the 70's teak timber wall panelling; sickening colour schemes; the technology of the day (phones and walkie talkies) various furnishings, ornaments (I noticed the glass Christmas tree which came full of chocolate coated nuts), cloths, and hair styles etc which were all gorily awesome in their detail. Was it really that bad? It is full of fun clichés but it's like a good book you can't put down. I gave it a 10 star rating, and I thank all those involved."
1306,"Sarcastic title, having finished season 1 a couple of days prior & looking forward to season 2.A great cast, good script & OK visual effects supported by good lighting, this show is a fun throwback to all Things 80's (You see what I did there?)& even part 70's (notice the Jaws' style police uniforms & vehicles). Swiftly combined elements of several film genres & music make for solid entertainment that proves - along with shows like Westworld - series are better then a lot of films that come out these days.There are quite some opinions that state season 1 wraps everything up ambigiously, but not necessarily needs to lead into a 2nd season. I'm rather glad it flows into season 2, which I read was always the intention.Stranger Things is worth the views, check it out!"
1307,"I rarely give a perfect 10 for films; out of 715 films I have seen and rated so far in my life (as of February 2017), I have only given a perfect 10 to 25 films--only around 3.5% of the films I have seen. Usually a perfect 10 film tends to be unique, innovative, groundbreaking, pushes the filmmaking artistry to a new level, or touches me personally. This film doesn't really meet such criteria but I gave it a 10 anyway.Sometimes you run across a film or television series that doesn't really push the boundaries but melds all the different elements nicely to produce a perfect film. This is one such television series. I just love how the filmmakers--Duffer brothers--got all the different elements, including acting, a mysterious plot, humour/character interaction, and style to work together seamlessly.If you like a family-oriented (not safe for little kids but main characters are kids and teenagers) series that realistically portrays relationships between parents and kids, while also dealing with a mysterious story, you will probably like this series. I think the acting by the large cast was excellent--not everyone was perfect but overall, the kids, teenagers, and adults acted very well together.The plot is probably the weakest part of the film. Some of it was kind of clichéd and predictable, with some minor parts seeming a bit unrealistic. I think the creators could have made it a bit more darker and unpredictable but I think they wanted to maintain the feel-good vibe, typical of the 80's. I think the careful attention paid to the style of the series, which is a homage to the retro 80s, makes up for the plot shortcomings.Overall, I highly recommend this series to everyone. The plot is a bit predictable so hardcore horror/mystery or art film fans won't like it that much. But I think the family interactions and the 80's style makes up for its shortcomings and rarely is there a film or series that is well made and appealing to a wide audience."
1308,"I loved this, and can't wait to see season two. It has a brilliant and gripping story line, well told and well acted by a fantastic cast. It took me right back to the 80's films, and i saw nods to many films i watched back then.Millie Brown is an exceptional young actress, she made me believe she was Eleven, the test subject with super powers, i know we will be seeing a lot of her in the future and rightly so, she was perfect for this part.I was also very impressed with the filming of this show, with so many spooky movies etc having everything done in too dark a setting so you can't tell what is going on, this did not happen here.The lighting was perfect, moody and atmospheric and beautiful at times, it was a pleasure to watch.I simply can't think of anything bad to say about this, please, lots more series!!!"
1309,"To start with, I would like to address another reviewer that speculated that all the rave reviews were written by articulate and insightful 12 & 13 year old's. He went on to say that no one over 14 would find Stranger Things intriguing enough to hold an adult's attention for more than 10 minutes. If that is the case, I am the world's oldest teenager. In the year this story takes place, I was 23 years old. So I will let you do the math. Of course, like so many who like to dis a show without watching the whole series, or even an entire episode, he wrote a review anyway. So I am compelled to ask, who really has the shorter attention span? I think the high IMDb rating is appropriate. After watching all 8 chapters of this story, that may yet to be over, I can say I was never bored. The acting was great and the Duffer Brother's took the time to build characters a viewer would care about. Eleven's ultimate fate seemed to be inevitable, but in science fiction, gone does not necessarily mean dead. She really was the hero of the story. My memories of 1983 are very clear, and the producers were very accurate on the dress, speech & music of the year. I so often see period pieces that use music or even fashion that would be off by a few years. So for myself, it was a nostalgic joyride. I only gave it 8 stars because the formula and plot are a patchwork of earlier shows & movies that I have seen over my many years watching Sci- Fi & horror. Having said that, I found it difficult to accurately predict what would happen next, so it kept me guessing and watching. I give Cu-do's to Netflix as I see original series that are far superior to any of the crap we get on regular TV these days. It is $12.00 a month that I never feel is a waste of money; and these days, that is a rare but wonderful thing."
1310,"Stranger things was the first TV show that I have ever watched entirely. It is a great TV show furthermore it is a good suspense to have fun. The story goes with some boys playing game for 10 hours, when Will, one of the boys, go back to his house, he weirdly disappeared. His friends looked for him, when suddenly they found a girl with super powers. She was created by an experience, her name is Eleven and she looked so scared because a bad man are wanting her to continue with the experience. She helped them to understand how to found Will, his mother and the chief of the city found Will in a place called the upside world. I just think the last chapter could be better, but in general it was good. I've watched other TV show like Strangers things, Supernatural but with one difference. Stranger things was fantasy story while supernatural was more realistic about spirits. I'm waiting so enthusiastically for the second season of Strangers things. I expect the monster is stronger and worse. During the show, Will's mother had been done the alphabet on the wall and put same lights to communicate with Will. I remember when I was a child I use to play with one, we wrote the alphabet in a paper, take a pen, do question so that the pen move from letter to letter forming words or sentences."
1311,"When you're searching recommended movies and shows on your Netflix account, you'll find Stranger Things filed under the 'Sit Down and Binge-Watch This' category. Though in terms of genre, you can't put just one tag on it. Drawing inspiration from classics like The Goonies, The Breakfast Club, The X-Files and The Thing, the eight, hour-long episodes mix ingredients like the 80's high school coming-of-age, to the young, meddling kids adventure, to the supernatural lurking around every corner. Though what makes it stand out from any other time-period homage is incorporating several 80's flavors into one detail-driven thrill ride, making sure that certain qualities don't get overpowered from others (and we'll try to keep the spoilers back — you're gonna have to taste it for yourself).While the series' main drive is on the disappearance of twelve-year-old Will Byers, the story divides into several subplots in attempts to find him — and in doing so adds focus to the characters in their search. We see his closest friends: Mike, Dustin and Lucas joined by Eleven, a young, mysterious girl with a hidden past, Will's mom Joyce teamed with Chief of Police Hopper and the older siblings of Mike and Will, Nancy and Jonathan. Each story line peers into the lives both past and present, on relationships, grieving, love and betrayal. Each event experienced presently or in backstory ultimately plays a role how everyone got to where they are now, and all come together in the final climatic episodes.The fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana and the day-to-day living is another key ingredient in how the show plays out. While most of the residents live in the ordinary bubble of Hawkins, the main set of characters experience the supernatural occurrences that have recently (and relatively silently) plagued the town, brought on by unnatural experiments from Hawkins Laboratory, just outside of town. This tone-shift in the story is well-thought-out and unlike some of the shows and films that came before it, it doesn't fall back on every-other minute scares and doesn't get held back by relying on secondary scripting or unnecessary fluff. It's a natural, even fade in and out of light and dark, both in in dialogue and visual aspects. In past films and television set back in 1980's America, one can argue that their love for nostalgia in their movies that can overpower the viewer's palette. And if you still haven't logged in to Netflix to add it to your queue, you'll find Stranger Things holds nothing back when bringing up 80's culture — but doesn't make it obnoxious. Instead of completely dedicating the show to it, the show's design and look subtly flaunts culture unique to the day and time and occasionally dropping music and movie titles in the script, but all have their purpose and contribute to the making and telling of the story.When all of these aspects are rolled into one, 'Stranger Things' makes a nice, refreshing return to the past in more ways than one. The presence of classic, unforgettable 80's culture, the investment of young, raw talent along with some familiar faces from the era and the punctual, accurate telling of the story is an experience for whoever presses the play button. Each episode has an impact; people from every generation can have a genuine relation to what's playing out on the screen, where each flavor and taste comes in at the right moment, and doesn't settle for blandness."
1312,"Words can't describe how much I love this show. The characters experience tremendous growth throughout the series, and all of them are lovable in their own ways. I am anxiously awaiting the next season. This is by FAR Netflix's best series. It's a spectacular 80's-style series, and is captured just beautifully. Dustin, aka ""Toothless,"" Mike, and Eleven are definitely my favorite characters, although all of them are cool in their own ways. For whatever reason, this series is able to capture the 80's, ""kids on bikes"" vibe without any corniness at all. I am absolutely captivated by this show... I finished it in a matter of days! The next season can't come soon enough!!!!!!!!!"
1313,"Perhaps my very low expectations are the reason I found this surprisingly good. It could have been a dreadful CGI-fest, but until the last episode the slick effects are kept to a minimum, and a lot is left to the imagination, which in my opinion makes for a more compelling experience. The acting is solid, and particularly the kids, which can make or break something like this, are not annoying, rather being well-cast and hitting the right balance. The plot is credible to an extent, but completely falls apart in the denouement, with manifold gaping holes in the last two episodes. However, how much plausibility can you really ask for in a show about monsters, telekinesis and ""the other side""? Considering this, I think it holds up quite well. All in all, this is a love letter to horror classics, and while references do not automatically equal quality, it has enough to please the buffs and those who simply want to watch something engaging and thrilling. A small gripe regarding references is that, for example, a scene almost completely ripped from Aliens which occurs in the last episode brought me out of the story and made me start thinking about Aliens, and the fact that Ryder had been in Alien 4, which is all rather distracting."
1314,"Stranger Things had a lot of suspenseful moments and overall the show in my opinion is excellent and has a lot of electricity and energy movements throughout the show. The most was when the electricity and energy movement occurred was when the Demogorgon appeared or when will was trying to communicate to someone. For example, when Will's mom was trying to communicate with him she used lights and wrote the ABCs on the wall and had him use that to communicate with her. The most suspenseful moments in the show would have to be when Eleven was basically put into the pool of water and she had to use her ""powers"" to communicate or try and find Barbs and Will. When she went we got to see the view of how the Underground world looks like and how things are. Another scene would have to be when El went to go defeat the Demon and her last word were "" i'm sorry mike"". She defeated the Demon to save everyone's life. The show is very very good and I would definitely recommend it to others. The show leaves us wanting to continue more and more after each episode and I literally cannot wait for Season 2!!!!!!!"
1315,"stranger things has a lot of electricity and energy moments.most moments are usually when the demogorgon is in the scene or they sense it. for example the scene when he took will he used the shed lights and the phone to scare him. in another scene where that was used was when will was trying to connect with his mother and he communicated with her with lights. there are also suspenseful moment like when eleven goes into the pool to go and find barb, also when barb and will disappeared. i feel that this show gave us many high hopes for the next season. also i like that the show didn't give many hints so it would always keep up guessing. this show is very interesting its has many unexpected moments and i cant wait for season two to come out"
1316,"""Stranger things"" is essentially ""Goonies"" meets ""Alien"". A fine blend of adventure and horror, with an 80s retro vibe that immerses you in a completely believable world. It undoubtedly engrosses anyone who sits down to watch. The direction is excellent and the performances, especially the ones from the young cast, will surprise you. As everyone will tell you, there is a cast of extremely talented young boys at the center of the plot, but Millie Bobby Brown as ""Eleven"" is a revelation - a young Sigourney Weaver that fights an equally terrifying ""Alien"". Millie has everyone out there ranting and raving about her, and deservedly so. It seems ""Stranger Things"" is going to be remembered in the future as the pedestal for the launching of her career as a major star. Millie approaches a very difficult and demanding role, that's stripped down verbally and has to be essentially performed using body language, with the maturity of a much older actress. The only problem with ""Stranger Things"", honestly, is, how the next season or seasons will be able to live up to the audience's elevated expectations! ""Stranger Things"" has set the bar very high for its own good. Here is to hoping the Duffer Brothers know what they are doing and they will not disappoint!"
1317,WOW! This was amazing! It takes every single 80's movie you've ever seen and smashes it together. I watched this show in less then 1 week and I loved it! 3 out of 5 people in my family are watching it or have already watched it. I would say this is certainly the best show I have ever watched besides Buffy the Vampire Slayer and maybe Sherlock. Each episode just gets better and better. I cannot wait for season 2. The characters are just great! and I love how many genres this show has. Get Netflix and watch this show NOW! I have so many good things to say about this show. I will never forget how good this show is! The acting's great! The theme song is great! Watch this right NOW!
1318,"I am typically very critical of TV shows and films, and recently there is very little that truly astonishes me. ""Stranger Things"" absolutely blew my mind and won my heart. However, with over 400 user reviews already posted here, there isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. So I'll just say a few things:This series is just incredible, and it's like nothing I've ever seen before, be it a TV series or a film. It reminds me very much of the type of horror films that John Carpenter has made, and Stephen King to a lesser extent. All the same, it's very much in line with 80's & 90's sci-fi horror. The period style of the series, which is the late 1980's, was done incredibly well. If you remember--or grew up during--the years between 1985 and 1995 like I did, then you will genuinely appreciate the little things in this series, as the period-correct atmosphere & set design makes it all the more enjoyable.ALL of the actors did an amazing job, the cinematography is incredible, as are the set designs, costumes, special effects, sound; absolutely everything is positively excellent in quality and in it's delivery. I've never seen anything done this well in this genre since the early movies which inspired it. There simply isn't anything bad that I can say about this show! Since I've begun reviewing movies & shows on IMDb, I've never given anything a 10/10, and I take that ""award"" very seriously, but ""Stranger Things"" totally deserves it! If you are a fan of 80's and 90's sci-fi & horror, this show was made for you. Even if you just want a real good, gripping, scary thriller to get into, this is it. It's a truly amazing piece of work! Bravo!"
1319,"This is what happens when you let the writers write a show the way it should be written. From what I know, around 20 networks told the brothers who wrote this that they should make a simple, one-dimensional series for dumb people. The brothers stuck to their vision because they wanted to make an amazing series and look what happened - they succeeded, because it turns out that viewers aren't as dumb as show producers think they are. If you know anything about storytelling, you will be blown away by what the writers have done here. The '80s details are one thing, the many references to classic and cult movies are another, but there is so much more to this. The child actors, for example, who were born already in the 21st century, are nothing like contemporary actors. They're just like Goonies, and I can't believe that they managed to act like that if they probably haven't even seen any '80s movies. Then there's the story, or rather 4 of them, perfectly blended together. How new events of each story are presented bit by bit is just brilliant. Writers of 99% of of modern TV shows have no idea about what pacing is or what makes viewers care about the characters. In 'Stranger Things' the viewer connects with the characters immediately. You watch it and cherish every moment. I never liked Winona Ryder, her acting was always stiff to me. Here, she's totally brilliant, as is everyone else. It's as if you've time-travelled and you're watching stuff happen in a small town for real. It's so realistic. Another amazing thing about this show is that there is hardly any CGI, or at least it's used in such a way that it doesn't show. Back in the '80s there was no CGI and movie-makers had to have sets built from scratch. Imagine how much work it took to make 'Terminator'. This show looks like it was mostly created by hand, except maybe the monster.Next thing: dialogues. They sound so natural and so cool, especially the kids' dialogues, but other characters also have realistic lines, it's just such a pleasure to listen to people talk in this show. It's almost music to the ears because you don't hear good dialogue these days anymore, it's always stiff, cliché-ridden, pompous, and the like. Here, you hear people talk as they usually talk. Again, it's like you ended up in the '80s for real. 'Midnight special', a movie that came out recently, got good reviews from the critics, who said that it's very good despite the obvious reference to 'E.T.' Well, like many other movies, that one was pretty much a cookie-cutter movie, full of overused lines and tricks. In 'Stranger Things' you see a lot of things borrowed from other movies and '80s books but the show is still fresh and original, and it's beyond me how they managed to create the same kind of atmosphere that you would've seen in those movies from 30 years ago. I hope that in season 2 the writers will keep up the good work because it would be a shame if they didn't. This is a must-see for everyone. It will make you recall at least 20 movies from when you were a kid. I'm just wondering what it's like for those born in the late '90s and later, that is those who don't know a world without the internet and cell phones and who've never seen the kind of clothes that the characters of 'Stranger Things' are wearing, or cars, or phones. When the mother of one kid says that they can go to the movie store together, that's bound to raise a few eyebrows.The funniest thing about 'Stranger Things' is that even though we're surrounded by technology, and everyone's on Facebook and Instagram, and we're glued to our cell phones, you can watch this show and not realize that none of this stuff exists in the show's reality. You will be so immersed that it will all seem natural - the fact that kids don't play computer games in their free time or the fact that you have to develop a camera film in the dark room. If you've lived through the '80s, you will easily forget the 21st century for the duration of the show. I hope Netflix will become THE network to go to if you want to watch a great show. Perhaps the dumbing down process can slowly be reversed and other networks will follow suit when they realize there's money to be made from interesting, cleverly-written and beautifully produced series. They don't make them like they used to but who says they can't again?"
1320,E.T meets Goonies and Resident Evil with Nostalgic Tron overtone. Horror combined with Telepathy - it's all going on. Short and simple - some series can over-do it with episodes but this was kept nice and simple. Not for kids -unless you want them to have nightmaresAction starts from beginning so it's not a slow burner.Hope you guys enjoy it. Lights turned off and volume turned up ;)Winona Ryder and the little girls acting is brilliant. I have to write an extra line in order to have this review posted but wanted to keep it short and simple.
1321,"Story was good not great but good,story telling and atmosphere was good, acting was generally good specially child actors acting was excellent. Surprisingly no hot chicks in an American Serries (lol). Only one thing was flawed and it was Winona Ryder. Such a terrible acting. If you pick random scenes of Winona's and what it without knowing the story line, you can not tell if she is afraid, surprised, worried or etc. etc. She was so fake every time she enters the scene and start talking i started to get bored. it is 9/10 without Winona Ryder but i must give -1 for Winona Ryder's terrible acting so 8 out of 10.Anyone would be perfect replacement for the Winona Ryder's part. Even Sandra Bullock could be better choice (lol) Of course she is as boring as Winona Ryder but at least she is not that fake."
1322,"When the trailer first came out, it didn't do much for me. It appeared to be just another generic thriller. However, I gave it a go one late night when I couldn't go to sleep and was immediately drawn in after the amazing title sequence. Not only does it set the tone for this 80's-inspired series by using the famous Stephen King book title font, but the theme track combined with the hypnotic movements of the letters falling into place is a pure joy to watch.""Stranger Things"" manages to give just enough answers to all our questions while at the same time giving us reason to want more. Unlike a lot of other shows these day, it is simple but effective at telling its story lines. There are a lot of nostalgia and references to the 80's childhood for the target audience to dwell in. Although the child actors aren't that great, their performances are innocent and heartfelt. Millie Bobby Brown however gives an amazing performance and I am sure we will see much more of her acting in the future.The episode run time of 40 minutes is ideal. These days it's hard to find anything else than comedy with a laughing track that keeps it so short. Unfortunately the show is over really fast too, but nothing good ever lasts, does it."
1323,"Stranger Things is an eight-episode Netflix original series created by the Duffer Brothers. Upon its release, it gained phrase from audiences and critics alike. After having been recommended this series by multiple people, I began to watch it fairly recently. I cannot say it hooked me - otherwise I would have finished it days earlier - but it was entertaining enough to watch all the way through. A lot worked in terms of characters and their development, but there were two particular things that didn't work; which I will talk about later in this review.In terms of positives, there is enough to phrase here. The characters and strong and effectively carry the show - the group of kids, who are the most central characters, are all particularly entertaining and witty - even if some of their performances aren't great. Winona Ryder's acting is by far the best, and David Harbour also gives a good performance (and a great character) as the police chief. The teenage characters aren't quite as strong, and the typical love triangle sub-plot bores, but none of them are bad. The character development throughout the series is great, making all the characters more and more likable as the series goes on. On the whole, the casting is excellent - everyone fits their part very well. Thankfully, it is consistent in its quality. None of the episodes are bad; although none of them are fantastic either. For me, each episode scores a 7 or an 8. The consistency keeps it from getting boring, which made it a series which I wanted to watch to the end. The other positives include a great soundtrack which works very well with the show's themes and scenes; a fun, if very retro title sequence; and generally good dialogue throughout. However, as mentioned above, there are two places in which this series falls down. The first of which is the lack of originality and clichés. This series is ultimately a homage of 80's sci-fi - there are scenes that reference, and steal from movies such as E.T., Aliens, The Thing, The Goonies and many more. At first the nostalgic references may work - but as the show goes on you release that it is not just referencing these movies, but blatantly stealing from them. Not one thing in this entire series is particularly original - everything becomes ridiculously clichéd and thus predictable. Unless this is the first movie or TV show you have ever seen, you will probably find the predictability and clichéness of this series very annoying (as I did).The other main issue is that almost all the twists are revealed far too early. There are too few surprises. We learn most things before the characters do and then have to watch as they finally catch up with the audience, which sometimes takes multiple episodes. So when a big shock comes around for the characters, there is absolutely no shock for the audience; which ultimately makes a lot of the series much less effective. But despite this, there are enough human dramas, engaging characters and sci-fi elements to make this an enjoyable eight episodes. In the end I would recommend this to a friend, even though this series falls short of the heights of the films it aspires to be."
1324,"The first thing i need to say is ,as a kid i watched a lot of VHS recorded movies and the sense of adventure was always big when i watched The Goonies , Indiana Jones ,etc....I like the old school vibe of this show and i really like to remember the old days when kids used their imagination to play in the street , not their mind-numbness as we see today :\I loved the 1st season and the transition for the 2nd was really well accomplished so lets hope it will be as great as this one.Please watch this show and give it a 10* , this must stay at the top as one of the greatest Netflix productions ."
1325,"Imagine the nostalgic memories you may rekindle from films like E.T. and The Goonies. Now drop your happy memories into a dark ""Silent Hill"" dimension.Watching this show made we want to go back and rate every other title at 9 out of 10. This series knocked it out of the park.Thank you to The Duffer Brothers and Netflix for working to bring us fun piece of work.I hope if there is a season 2, it will survive expectations. This show really raised the bar IMHO.This series sent me on a 80's binge. Today's pick for viewing was ""flight of the navigator"""
1326,"Wow... I would like to start this review with a Wow. Why? Because it is a amazing series! Every minute of the series is just perfect! I love the style of the 80's. I did not grew up in the 80's or something but if i see the series, i would like to grew up at that time. The anger the communism gave and things, i like the temper. Also the casting for this series is phenomenal, i mean i never saw a group of young children act like this, it was so good. And to be honest i have a little crush on the older sister Nancy, because holy mama she looks good! This series comes close to my all time favorite Twin Peaks. Twin peaks is still my favorite because of the fact that Twin Peaks did make me lose some sleep at night and Stranger Things doesn't do that with me. But overall i would like to thank Netflix for the amazing series they made."
1327,"For a few weeks now, Stranger Things, Netflix's newest ""original"" series has received the kind of buzz that only a new Netflix show can seem to manage these days. It's been recommended to me by just about everyone, and when I finally sat down to watch it, I found myself in a really weird mixed head space. Because at the core of it, I love the show. There is so much to praise it for. But after every episode, I found myself wondering, often times aloud and to anyone who would listen, why it works. Because I can't seem to get around the notion that it absolutely should not work.for my full review, visit https://barrysreview.wordpress.com/2016/08/15/stranger-things/"
1328,"This movie has something for anyone who grew up loving 80's Sci-Fi only with better production values. Everything is vintage and authentic: the setting, the villains, the protagonists, the atmosphere, the stereotypes, the bullies...even the credits reminded me of my youth. As you would imagine with so many 10 star ratings, the story is compelling and the acting is brilliant. I started watching this based on a recommendation from my daughter and before I knew it, it was 2:30 in the morning. I haven't immersed myself in a show like this in a very long time and I loved every minute of it. Bravo to Netflix for another wonderful, if not their best, original series."
1329,"Throughout the years I found it difficult to get rid of so many images in my head that came directly from some of Stephen King's novels. When I sat to watch the whole eight hours of Stranger Things I was in one of those trips of my life of which I didn't want out.This is a film, much more than a series. You could skip the intro titles and have a seamless story told with depth, comedy, heart and wit.From what I said above, you can tell I regard Stephen King pretty high on my list of American writers. He teamed once with the other Steve to make a series that promised something new (because the book was good) and utterly failed. So, I'd rather take King's writings than adaptations. But Spielberg's films are films, not books, and lots of them are absolutely fantastic. Borrowing from two great story-tellers and making something worth has never been easy. I'd say impossible. Because I haven't found anything even close to E.T. or ""The Body"" (which became Stand by Me), ever.And what makes this new Netflix venture worth a ton of gold is that it actually gets to places you and I want to go. The characters are beautifully drawn, and then layered and painted in a way they'll stick with you for a long time.This film, even with the slight criticism of not being perfect in some regards (like some of the songs), is a masterpiece of storytelling for kids, teens and adults. It is as enjoyable as E.T. was. So much that I want to see it on the big screen. It's not a trivial series. It's as serious as it gets.The kids in the film are memorable, really creating a brotherhood that I wanted to be a part of. All of them have their own problems, their very clearly defined personalities and roles, their charming funny sides... they're lovable and you can relate to any of them.Winona Rider's character is full of passion and realism in this otherwise completely fictitious tale. But, wasn't that what ""It"" gave us? Even with the terrible ending of the book and the miniseries, who in the world wouldn't remember Bev shooting her silver bullets in the sewer against ""It""? Or the conversation between Gordie and Chris under the tree when camping by the Royal River? Lines from the heart of gold of Stephen King. Action and adventure from the mind of Steven Spielberg. But this is different. Matt and Ross Duffer created something that may have all the elements of those 80's films and novels, but with freshness and depth.You can relate to the characters because they ARE human, they are well developed, you KNOW about them. That's King's turf. And the emotions, the adventures, the way they're captured are Spielberg's signature. But, alas! here we have both worlds in one film that will be as timeless as It was or E.T. Characters like Eleven may be part of future conversations of younger generations, as are Gordie and Chris, who will never stop moving young and adult audiences even 40 years later.The whole success of this series is that, at last, the Duffers brought to the screen something with real soul. And that's pretty uncommon nowadays."
1330,"Netflix has done again after shows like Daredevil and House of Cards. Its almost like one new great show every year. First episode would grasp your interest to watch more. Acting by Eleven, Hopper and Joyce is really good. I don't hear about Duffer Brothers before, I guess this is their first big project and they nailed it. This show has been much better but I feel something not plausible. Like research done by 3 friends in search of Will. They are searching whole city, risking their lives and more. If the monster took Will, why wouldn't he will take you? In my opinion, someone adult or police should have done that kind of research in finding Will. Police Chief Hopper had done so much already but giving that role to children is over hypothetical. In real life that will never happen. Secondly, why the monster will keep Will alive. He captured Will in first 8 minutes, why didn't he just eat him? Why would he kill Barbara and other? And Finally, their science teacher he has answer to everything. Shoot any question and he has the answer ready. He didn't need to look into any book or anything. Except these 3 things, I really enjoyed the show. I guess Eleven and Monster are still alive and we'll see in Season 2. Its best Netflix show, certainly better than House of Cards or Daredevil. I don't say whether this is best new show of 2016 or not, because I hope HBO's 'Westworld' will be better. Hopefully they will maintain this kind of quality in Season 2."
1331,"Stranger Things is Netflix's latest original series to hit the network. From everything I've seen that has the Netflix stamp on it, I'm yet to be disappointed. With that and great reviews of this series, I was really excited to finally get into Stranger Things and check it out for myself.Like most Netflix series, they are designed to be binged, and Stranger Things is no different. This 8 episode series plays like a movie. While it has no reflection of the quality of the show itself, I think it's a massive credit to the writers and directors to make this seamless series feel like an 8 hour movie. Unfortunately I was unable to watch it all back to back, with the longest session being the final 4 episodes. However with it only being 8 episodes, this is a series you can easily re-watch in the space of a day. And for me, this is one I'm going to watch this one a few times over.Stranger Things is at the heart a mystery/thriller/horror series. Plot wise, when I was watching it I thought it had an Insidious feel. Without going deep into plot points, if your a fan of the Insidious franchise than you will be completely onboard with the plot line in this series. The whole time you are watching it you are trying to work out what is actually going on. I went into this series completely blind from trailers and synopsis so everything to me was a big mystery. I know at this point it may have been hard to skip all this stuff but I you can, I heavily suggest you go in as blind as you possible can.Again without giving too much away, I thought the main cast were fantastic. I thought everyone nailed their role that all played into the final bigger picture. Everyone from Winona Ryder as the mother, David Harbour as the chef and Matthew Modine as a mystery scientist. For me though, a big credit to the child actors throughout this series, especially Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. I thought she played the mysterious role better than anyone else in the series. What made her performance so great was that for the most part, she didn't say much, but when she did, she spoke it with a sense of naivety and unawareness that her character is portrayed as. On a side note Dustin was by far my favourite character. For the most part he was the comedic relief of all the tense sense and I thought Gaten Matarazzo handled the role perfectly.For many people, the biggest appeal of this series is the 80s feel. Even though I was born in the 90s, watching this series heavily reminded me of the feel I got as a kid when I watched those 80s movies such as ET. From what I've heard from people who had their childhood based in the 80s, the way the child cast is portrayed as they typical 80s kids is spot on. For me personally I saw the connection between the kids in Stranger Things and those in ET. On a side note, my favourite thing they did to set the tone of the 80s was the opening credits. Everything from the font to the music felt completely 80s. I'm not sure if the opening credits was filmed on film but the way the text never say flush and the white flickers that is typical in film really set the tone of what the series would be.Stranger Things is one of those rare series that once you sink you teeth into it, your hooked. I thought it was a great all round story that had a big sense of start, middle, end that we typically find in movies. It's really hard to pin point anything specifically that I didn't like about this series apart from not being able to watch it all in one day and not growing up in the 80s to allow me to completely relate to the nostalgia and characters of the series. I think if I grew up in the 80s this would of been a home run but because I at times struggled with that connection, it feel a bit short.9/10"
1332,"If you're like me, who doesn't enjoy watching horror movies or series and doesn't want to have sleepless nights, this might be the perfect mix for you!""Stranger Things"" really does something special: Yes it scares you and sometimes even shocks you, but it doesn't try to lure you into a trap and then bite your head off. I'm on IMDb since 15 years and this is my first review, because I really had some kind unique experience. I actually feel like somebody cared for me while watching. Why? Because when I got scared, there were some nice or funny scenes afterwards to cheer me up again. It's like a roller-coaster: You can relax on the easy parts and you will get thrilled on the way down. There might be parts that you would have liked a bit different. But in the end you'll get out with a smile and want to ride again.What really made the difference for me: I could fully engage with what was happening and that's what I'm normally not doing when things get scary. ""Stranger Things"" delivered the perfect amount of thrill to keep me on my toes, but it also gave me enough room to relax and think. It is trustworthy and honest.Why 9 out of 10? Some things around the main plot were a bit illogical for me. And some cuts were odd. Normally, I don't pay attention to things like that. But there were some scenes, where the cuts were obviously off (different facial expression in camera scenes, different postures in different scenes).But both points didn't spoil the great experience. If you think that you might be a bit like me, go for it! You won't regret it."
1333,"Stranger Things Episode 1No spoilers, since the title is The Vanishing of Will Byers. So a kid goes missing, and this whole town is searching for him. Stranger things are happening all around and no one is mentioning it.To best describe this show is to mash up The Goonies meets Akira. At least that's the vibe I'm getting so far, one episode in. The writing and direction in this Netflix show is so much better than the Duffer brother's other work: namely Wayward Pines. Though now, I have Hidden on my queue so that I can see a better example of their work. Joyce, Byers, played by Winona Ryder is the first listed on the cast, but from the first episode she was over-acting. I know a mom is suppose to be hysterical when a child goes missing, but her performance wasn't believable. Hopefully in the later episodes she does better. Maybe my expectations out of Ryder are too high.David Horbour plays Jim Hopper, you might remember him from Black Mass, but really he plays minor roles. He's a bit hit or miss when it comes to his performance in the first episode. He has some great strides but acting is a marathon.The kids in this show are perfect. There isn't anything wrong with their acting or delivery. They feel real even if it's set over 40 years ago. Their child performance is on par with The Goonies, Harry Potter, Stand by Me, or ET. The teenagers on the other hand are worse. I mean annoyingly worse. You're gonna be bored or exhausted watching their subplot.Verdit: Worth watching more episodes. Between the story and acting I will be finishing the first season."
1334,"Never saw it coming.The first time I read the synopsis I was like ""who wants to watch some 80's style show with some kids and cheesy sci-fi nonsense""How wrong I was! I'm hooked. It's beautifully shot and paced, the kids are great, and story telling is compelling.Another winner from Netflix.I heard there will be Season 2, looking forward to it.The score is nice too - brings back some memories.Watch it!"
1335,"After two people from two different circles with vastly different viewing preferences recommended this show to me, I bumped it up a few slots on my To Watch List.... ... and promptly binge-watched the entire first season. What makes it so addictive: 1. Great characters you can empathise with I have stopped watching many TV shows for lack of likable protagonists, but the ensemble in Stranger Things is interesting and well-rounded, yet the information on each character isn't divulged immediately. I felt like I was getting to know the characters better from episode to episode, and each minute sucked me deeper into this world. I couldn't stop because I wanted to know first and foremost how the characters' journeys would go on. 2. Great child actors Because seriously, where did they find these kids? 3. Slow-build mystery The show takes its time to unveil the mystery - and it manages to maintain a sense of suspense while doing so! At least for me :) 4. The cinematography I was born in the 90s, so I can't judge how 'true' the 80s feel of this show was, but the visual of it was amazing. If you value cinematography porn, you'll definitely enjoy Stranger Things!Why I don't want to re-watch it immediately: The great thing about mysteries is not knowing what's going on or how it will end. While I was unable to stop watching the first time around, now that I've lived through it I don't feel the need to re-watch it. That's the only reason it didn't get ten stars (okay, that and the heteronormativity)."
1336,"Without saying anything about the actual storyline, I can definitely say: WOW, a refreshing new series with an elegant retro feel! It takes you back to the 80's, totally believable. All the equipment, clothes and fashion, cars, music, buildings, etc. are so well chosen and gives the story such an authentic feel. The synthesizer theme song is awesome - it enhances the whole experience, killer! The acting is superb, this includes all ages - even the kids did an amazing job, their work didn't seem forced or faked, and they have amazing chemistry on screen! Great camera angles too.If you like mystery/sci-fi/thriller stories like the X-Files, American Horror story, Super 8, or ET, than this show (which has elements of all these) will surly not disappoint. In fact, I really had no expectations and was totally hooked by the end of the first episode! Looking very forward to the next season and am curious to see how they will develop the plot. I can only hope it doesn't become too predictable - that it still keeps me at the edge of my seat!"
1337,"1st season-Awesome
2nd season- good
3rd season- worst"
1338,"If you want horror, humour, heart breaking, heroes & heroines, happening edge of your seat action, hope & hysteria. This is the show for you. This is not my generation show & I don't know why Netflix keep putting Shows like Ozark for Grammy awards. We have to move on. The kids are smart & hilarious."
1339,All the seasons were nice and not waste of time . So I am rating 10
1340,"I was late to the Stranger Things Universe. While everyone was raving over it on social media, I took a peek at the trailer and said ""No thanks"". See, this show featured two things I really, really hate in movies or TV shows...Kids and teenagers. This show had both. No thanks.
Well, in case you missed it, we are in a pandemic and things get boring. So, I decided to give ST a shot. I was impressed. The kids weren't too bad, the teenagers were, but the story was pretty good so I ignored the teens. It was definitely, spooky. A 'sho nuff who done it'. Who is this girl? What exactly does this lab do? What are are these creepy things going on? To top it off, fantastic performances by Winona Ryder and David Harbour. So, I really got into it And I wasn't disappointed, until season three. Then it reverted to a stupid kids show. It became very silly and well, stupid. It still had a few moments but the show lost whatever it was it had. It devolved into a really moronic and goofy show. Maybe they will get back to what made the show so good to begin with."
1341,"Highly recommend first season especially. There is a lot that goes downhill after that, especially season 3. It's a horror show, but season 3 doesn't feel like it most the time. Watch the first 2 seasons they are unbelievable, still watch season 3 but don't expect as much horror and more comedy."
1342,It's a perfect teen show with some neat twist and suspense. Loved the show and waiting for season 4.
1343,I have seen many web series among those it is my top 3.
1344,Teenage bounty hunters and stranger things are the only two programs on Netflix worth watching I really hope they switch to a different streaming service between the inappropriate show Cuties and Netflix rate hikes I don't think I'm going to end my account with Netflix. Like I said only two shows worth watching and I keep hoping they'll go to another streaming service because Netflix is charging too much and they just keep raising the price. On top of that they just keep on making crap shows horrible horrible programming and then they charge way too much. It's going to be good by Netflix soon
1345,"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana."
1346,"This isn't a really good tv show with a great storyline and amazing characters.
The actors are brilliant and smashed their parts especially Finn wolfhard and Millie Bobby brown. Obviously the others did perfect as well. The story is good but can get a bit much Andre for me it got a bit hard to get all of what was going on at first but after a bit I really got the 80's sci-fi context. Grea show 100% recommended to anyone with a Netflix account or someone who loves 80's films. Or just films or shows in general"
1347,The third season is a complete failure. Im veeery disappointed.
1348,"Watching season 3 has been a real disappointment, if there were more than 8 episodes I wouldn't have continued watchingAlso feel tricked, the last episode is just dragging on, thought it was only 45 mins, disappointed to see there's another half hour, pile of crap."
1349,Good ass show i gotta say. third season is the best
1350,"Every series is associated with a set of genres, but this one can't be.
When someone asks me how is stranger things, I say its strange, I just can't classify if its fantasy, sci-fi, horror, thriller and what not. It all of them and none of them simultaneously.
Kids have a quirky sense of humor, making us laugh at times
I would say just go for it, indulge yourself into the strangeness of stranger things."
1351,"Although it's full of stereotypical situations, and I'm not really a fan of a sci-fi genre, it is pretty good. I would give it 6 if I had noticed stereotypes more, but I didn't, and it wasn't that much cringe, considering the Netflix is the producer. Overall, there are
lots of scenes that will make you laugh, thrilled and in excitement of what is to come, so I honestly recommend watching this !"
1352,"The best serie of all time, watch it you will not regret"
1353,Guys! this show is the bomb! Definitely a must-see. Very addictive Netflix series. Very suspenseful and will have you on the edge of your SEAT! Check it
1354,"This is one of the best series I have ever seen.
The choice of the characters is unbelievable because they tried to show us some new faces than the usual ones in this kind of (block buster series).Let's talk about the music. The man who have compiled all the songs of the movie is a genius. He has tried to take us back to the 80' with a modern touch.The story is well done because the producer wants to lead us in the 80' and it works well.Some episodes are very stressful and some are very funny."
1355,This is a masterpiece. Great script.actors are in full form specially mention of David Harbour's hopper and winnona ryder's mrs.Byers.loved it.
1356,"This is a drama about a gang of teens set in a fictive 1980s town of Hawkins. The atmosphere from 80s is recreated in a phenomenal way includes clothes, hobbies, music and behaviours. For those that lived during these time it is a fantastic time machine full of nostalgic memories. So on the surface it is a super col sci-fi drama with teens set in the 1980s. Even the special effects seems authentic without overloads of CGI. On a deeper level, the series is also an expression for the longing for a lost security and a more traditional America, symbolized by the small town of Hawkins. The first season is about how the security of the childhood disappears as the teenagers meet a supernatural evil force, while the second season is about their struggle trying to cope with the trauma and also how to be able to carry this secret experience and thereby being different from from others.The origin of the trauma is that the government has done secret experiments above above public knowledge and instead of admitting their mistakes leading to the evil force, and is trying to cover up and mislead the situation. Here it is easy to draw parallells from this to the ongoing changes in our society where our known world is challenged by new forces like technological changes, terrorism, migration and cultural tensions, political misuse of power etc etc. Where the common answer from authorities often are: don't worry trust us, we have it under control. While the truth often is nobody has a clue what is really going on..As the story progresses, the helper/hero in this, ""Eleven"" becomes more and more normal. From at the beginning of the story be viewed as a freak in the periphery, ""Eleven"" moves into the centre as more normal. Being more accepted. Also a good parallell to whistleblowers that gain more acceptance and credibility when it becomes much harder to hide the harsh reality. So, it is a great series with many levels. Very well produced and intensely thrilling. Looking forward to season three."
1357,Absolutely Marvelous. Everything is so perfect about the show.
1358,"It gives me a rush. This gives me chills.
I love these young tigers!"
1359,"First season starts with a bang when one kid- Will Byers, goes missing and this is followed by more people disappearing and appearance of a mysterious girl. While searching for Will his family and friends get to know about some experiments and an alternate reality upside down which is threatening their existence. It also sets up the character of Eleven, where it was shown how and what powers she develops. Major part of first season is about character development and the characters trying to unravel the mystery behind disappearances.Second season is about the creatures from upside down hitting back and unraveling past of mysterious girl- Eleven and development of new chemistry between Police chief Jim Hopper and Eleven. They could have easily avoided episode 7 where Eleven meets her sister Kali who possess power to make people see or not see something unless , she has some Important role in upcoming seasons, It hampered the momentum built in episode 5 and 6 which continued in episode 8 and 9.My favorite scenes from season 1
=> When Mike's younger sister sees the creature from upside down
=> The way Lucas get into commando mode to get back his friend Will
=> Fight between Will's Brother- Jonathon and SteveMy favorite scenes/episodes from Season 2
=> Chapter 5 Dig Dug where Jim Hopper get stuck in alternate reality is the best episode of both the seasons - It gave me Goosebumps
=> When the creature hits back i.e. episode 6 and episode 8
The group of Kids - Will Byers, Dustin , Mike and Lucas are shown as nerds and do very well especially Dustin who on first look appeared disgusting but as the story goes on he is one of the cutest and funniest character and not as bad as i found him on 1st look. Will didnt have much to do in Season 1 but in season 2 he is pretty good as someone being taken over by creature or virus. Mike is the one i found least interesting but he is shown as someone who is always there for his friends. Lucas is fun throughout but best part is in second season - his chemistry and love spark with the new girl who enters their group - Maxi and his banter with younger sister.
Maxi is shown to be asocial and recluse due to her broken family and abusive step brother but once she spends some time with Lucas and Dustin , she endures even ill-treatment by Mike just to be the part of their group. She is the coolest in their group.Jonathon - Brother of Will Byers, plays a weirdo , freak who love photography and loves his mother and brother a lot and is shown to be very responsible family guy.He is head over heals in love with Nancy but not expressive
Nancy Wheeler- Sister of Mike, is studious, super intelligent but for a period tries to be a rebellion to be part of group of Steve when she starts dating him , but soon she finds herself more inclined towards Jonathon. She is shown to be courageous and brave.
Steve - plays boyfriend of Nancy - a popular rich boy who has slept with many girls , initially though even Nancy looked like one of them but slowly it was shown that despite his insecurities regarading her,he cares about Nancy and even fight the creature and as the character develop he is shown as a guy with a good heart , One thing i didnt like is, though he was the most popular guy but is beaten black and blue by every guy( i liked him being beaten by Jonathon but not the other two)
Bob - Boyfriend of Will's mother- Joyce, is very intelligent and sharp , though seem little boring with his outdated jokes and over friendly nature but his love towards Joyce and his endeavor to get the trust of Joyce's son was endearing. He plays an important role solving the figures drawn by Will to save Hopper from creature and then ended up being ""Bob-The-Superhero"" when he protects all of them stuck in Hawkins lab full of Demagorgans
To connect to a series most important things is to connect to its characters and the characters i connected to most are Eleven- Mysterious girl, Joyce - Will & Jonathon's mother and Jim HopperEleven - she was called weird in 1st season but i had a crush on her the first time i saw her and i have fallen in love with her , this much cute i find her. She is shown to be brought as guinea pig away from real world , so her interaction with the real world was interesting , she learns about friendship , family , home and all i can say is the actress Millie Bobby Brown has enacted her part with aplomb. Only thing i didnt like is she shown to be in love with Mike and iam super jealous Jim Hopper - He plays Hawkins police chief who has lost his daughter to cancer and wife and stays alone but he cares about his town , small kids and his friend- Joyce . Despite showing him as indifferent, hard and a cool guy he has a very soft heart- the reason he develops a father daughter relation with Eleven and does everything possible to keep kids safe.Mother of Will and Jonathon - Joyce - played by Winona Ryder is a caring mother though she isnt able to devote much time to her children due to her being working single mother . Winona has given a superlative performance especially in season 1 . She deserve every award for her performance as brave , determined courageous mother who is nervous and paranoid but will do anything to get her son back. Her smile is also very infectious
there are few other character in small roles like Brenner , Kali, Billy , Owens, Karen but there is not much to discuss about them till now"
1360,How can people do Stranger Things a review under nine stars this show was amazing it has an awesome how do people things are of you under nine stars the show was amazing it has a great Plot! I could watch this Show over and over again !
1361,"I never thought this would be so good. I'm a huge GoT fan, and that show is so grandiose and engaging, no show excites me that much now. But this show is really engaging. I mean there are things which you have seen earlier, The show is a homage to 80s sci-fi horror movies, you will see influences from the works of John Carpenter,Steven Spielberg, and even Stephen King.But the show is quite honest about this fact, and doesn't even try to hide this.I mean it's even set in the 80's! complete with music, attires and situations dipped in good old 80s nostalgia, and i don't know about others, I loved the setting!
The characters are very warm, and very relatable. All turn in stellar performances. Particularly the kids. Bobby brown as Eleven is very impressive. 
If you haven't started watching this, start right now, if you love 80's sci-fi horror movies, you're absolutely gonna love this one!"
1362,"Let me just; this just blew me away!Had just read the Netflix short intro and thought ""well, another one with some kid mysteriously disappearing...yawn""But then slow night when I couldn't sleep I gave it a shot, and I was soon sucked in to this weird story, and that it was actually about MK-ULTRA program in the 70-80's, and the acting from both the kids who are the centre protagonists and the adult actors is top notch. It's a complete flashback to the 80's, with all from music, cars and everything else.
The main plot centres around a mysterious girl stumbling out of the woods in Indiana, dirty and with an abnormally short-shaved hair. She gets shelter at a family's home and it soon turns out she's seriously traumatized and some freaky mental powers not to be trifles with. Another small boy from the same town goes missing in the woods and cannot be found.
Strangely acting people start turning up in the town under different disguises, asking questions, making seemingly ordinary electric installations around town. 
The search for the lost boy and who the girl really is falls upon a group of 3 young kids who makes stunning discoveries; something really dangerous lurks in the woods and the governement seems to be involved.It's well worth the high ratings here, can't wait for a third season. A really good Netflix experience!"
1363,"Just finished watching season one and enjoyed it very much. Looking forward to season two.
Enjoyed all the actors and also the 80s setting.
Millie Bobby Brown is phenomenal. I am also a fan of David Harbour who is just great. Winona Ryder can do no wrong in my book (unless she's shoplifting). 
I'm not super-crazy about the monster thing. 80s nods aside, it's so cheesy. For me it would have been more effective if you never see the monster, just the lights and the people disappearing. And if the Upside Down was just a bit different - maybe more surreal rather than gross, more mystery than an actual ""place"", a place where people just got lost or experienced paranormal phenomena, more ""Lost"" than ""Alien,"" it would have been more interesting.However I do like the characters, the actors, and the unfolding of the story, so I will watch season 2."
1364,"I think Stranger things it's such a different type of show, i love the 80s vibe mixed with such modern technology and psychokinesis. The best part is definitely the acting of the cast and the awesome friendship those kids have, so freaking fun to watch. Very original, even though it might have slightly too hyped about when it came out though, not saying it doesnt deserve all that attention though! must watch"
1365,Stranger things is interesting but is something that i could only watch once to enjoy. In season one the story is interesting and the whole 11 story made me want to watch more. sadly in season two i lost all interest in 11. the kids were way more interesting and they did pretty basic kid things. except for when they fight demogorgans. in season three id like to see more of the kids and less of 11 unless they plain on making her interesting again. the new character max was interesting. she was cool and showed the kids whos boss. normally i dont like it when the show adds a new character that adds nothing to the story. but max filled in for eleven and made me ignore elevens story. another suggestion for season 3 less 11 and more max. sorry this review probably make no since.
1366,"The 80s has been magically captured in this series, Season 1 and Season 2 are as equally exciting and popcorn-scattering crazy. The children are so loveable and funny. High points are well-deserved by these newcomers as truly , they remind me of a lot of people and things we have done and had during the 80s. What may be seen by millenials as a lack of gadgets, fancy bags, hovers etc is more than compensated by the aura of simplicity and being happy with what you have, family and friends. Who will forget those neon boards and posters and not to forget those hairstyles. Watch it and just enjoy, can't wait for the new episodes ."
1367,"Stranger Things is like the love child between The X-Files and Hanna. Super top secret government conspiracy, bionic super-child with super powers... It's all been done before, but this show gives it all a unique twist. A must watch tv series by Netflix."
1368,"Awesome cast and storyline; I enjoyed the series and I am excited for what the next season has in store for us.
both the visual and audio of the series really bring out the 80's vibe.
good choise of music
watching just one episode of this is a hard task
from episode 1 you will gret drawn in an amazing story.I recommend this series to anyone looking for a good time."
1369,"Didn't start season 2 yet, but Netflix did a good job in creating something you'll want to bing on uncontrollably. A nice surprise indeed.
8 out of 10."
1370,Netflix has really done it again. It truly is an amazing show and the actors are great! The only reason I didn't give it a 10 is because the first few episodes are kind of confusing.
1371,"The perfect blend of Steven Spielberg, Stephen King, and 80's in general. The series could've easily gotten by on pure nostalgia, but it went the extra mile to have an intriguing plot, likable and realistic characters, good pacing, and an amazing original soundtrack. I only have three major issues with the series.
1. IMO, Mike and Eleven's relationship feels EXTREMELY forced. The entire first season I thought they were great friends, and then they kissed and I was like ""Uhh, okay? We're doing this then?""
2. I seem to be one of the only people who LOVED S2E7: The Lost Sister, but I still can't deny that it interrupted a cliffhanger ending, and I do think it could've been, I don't know, half an episode instead of a whole one?
3. The ending of Season 2 was a little underwhelming. Come on! I wanted to see more of the Mind Flayer!
Even with these flaws, I still love the series."
1372,"I had seen some pictures from about ""stranger things"" and it looked interesting and that's why I wanted to see it.So what is it.If you take goonies, the thing and add some sci-fi parallel universe. Then you have stranger things but a lot worse then you have seen before. In the first scene in stranger things you will see the poster from the 1982 movie ""The thing"" by J.carpenter this follows trough the series so looks like the thing is a inspiration that those who made stranger things have as inspiration.If you love thing, parallel universe, and monsters like alien, the thing. Then I think u like this.I hate monster movies and screaming kids in every scene if u do the same then my advice is forget this."
1373,Amazing performances from the young and upcoming cast and some brilliant glimpses from the veterans
1374,"I loved season 1 and 2 every character had a story line and you feel that you are actually there when you turn stranger things on!
In Season 3 it was more dark in my opinion but very good and I also forgot to put the subtitles on. Can't wait for season 4 and hopefully Stranger things will get much more seasons after season 4 if season 4 goes well."
1375,This is one of the best shows on television currently and when all is said and done I think we'll remember it with the other greats of this era
1376,Every season get better every season have a story that get in our hearts best TV show ever
1377,"I can't believe what garbage this show was. Watching nothing but screaming and panic for hours upon end, no character background to be found, horrible humming noises, and every cliché ever made dumped into a sloppy mess. The monster, the government, and the kid 11 have almost no meaning, no explanation, and no relationship to each other. The only reason this gets anything over a rating of 1 is because the costumes and background really reminded me of the old days (haha). I don't know why they left the ending open like they did. If they're planning on a second season they should consider starting over and using a different cast."
1378,Good execution and nice detailing ! Looking for next season
1379,"It has the best story lines, acting and CGI. Most of the actors are kids and they do an awesome job. Keeps me on the edge of my seat every episode."
1380,"This series had it all!! Amazing 80's music, laughter, happiness and then the ability to bring me to tears thanks to the amazing acting (especially Millie Bobby Brown)"
1381,"The first season was beautifully written with mystery and suspense with brilliant characters.Season two introduced a few new characters which was definitely a good choice. Plus answering many season one questions while also creating more thrilling sequences. Even though I cried when Bob died.Season 3 tops it off with drama and romance while also sticking to the story and keeping the mystery alive, the envolvement of the Russians and the new mall. And even with the loss of Hopper and Joyce taking Johnathon, Will and Eleven away from Hawkins. I feel for season 4 they will return to Hawkins and even better I don't think it's the last time we see hopper with the post credit scene.All in all a visual masterpiece at its finest creating drama, suspense and mystery."
1382,"Season 1 and 2 were sensational and season 3 is much more intense and thrilling. It has a perfect mixture of teen mood swings, romance, action, mystery and thrill !!"
1383,"Well,this is a review that took me a lot of time to lay out but here goes nothing.When I first watched Stranger Things I was really surprised. It was one of those 'stumbled into it' type of the show where it keeps you on your seat the whole day.Season 1 was a complete standalone season which payed excellent homage to 80s horrors and thrillers.The writing was amazing and there were a lot of iconic scenes that really took the world by storm(Like the Christmas lights scene)The characters were very well developed and of course the groundbreaking performances by the actors chosen to play them.I give season 1 a 10/10
Season 2 premiered on Halloween so they had to ante up the horror while maintaining the show's heart and originality. It is still a 10/10.
After waiting for more than 1 and a half years I really expected more thrills and scares from ST3.But nope,I didn't.Season 3 was focusing more on relationships and had a lot of heart that came with it.I do admit they overdid the comedy a bit because they had already built the horror background from the previous seasons.Very many people were overreacting about the comedy in ST3,which was highly explainable because it was a 4th of July season,which is a season of festivities so I can't argue with that.I really admired season 3 because they managed to keep the intense thrills that Stranger Things comes with.Also the hormonal drama between El and Mike was cliched but really funny.What really pissed me off about season 3 was destroying a very good potential relationship between Steve and Robin.Season 3 made Hopper more jerky and funny which really didn't sit well with fans that looked up to him(Myself Included).What makes season 3 worth salvaging is because that is the final season we will ever see in Hawkins.What makes season 3 a 10/10 was that finale. It was one the most ambitious finales ST has done.The emotion was as euphoric as ever and had a huge kill off no one would expect.The one thing that Season 1&2 missed was a cliffhanger that really leaves someone hanging there.The ST3 ending teases a much darker season 4 which we really need.
In conclusion,the duffer brothers tried something different with season 3 and unlike some shows(The flash(S4),Riverdale(S3)etc.)they actually managed to make Stranger things amazing even with the over-humor.
I Rate the show as a whole a 9.8/10(2 points deducted for what was supposed to be a Strobin)
This is definitely a show that I will stick around for until it wraps up.
Though please,a message to the Duffer Brothers,ANTE UP THE HORROR NEXT SEASON!!!!!,and try not to drag the storyline for 3 episodes or so(Like in ST3)"
1384,"It is the most amazing and thrilling series I've ever watched. In 30 years of my life I have never watched such a great TV series. It takes you on high and lows from sad to happy moment and is extremely funny
S3:
Hopper dies
Billy dies
Alexei dies!!!
S2:
Bob dies
Dustins cat dies
S1:
Barbara dies
With all of this they still seem to make the best show ever and the casting is unbelievably great"
1385,"Season 1 = 10, Season 2 = 7, Season 3 = 10 so they redeemed the show back from season 2 o enjoyed watching it as i always do , at first i didn't like the entrance of some new charcters from season 2 but the added characters to the group is ok. I can't wait for season 4 hopefully it's not as long of a wait as before but if so understandable"
1386,"The winner still goes to season 1 and 2. I don't really like the storyline of stranger things in season 3 cause the Russia storyline seems useless and boring. I prefer to rewatch season 1 & season 2 again, but not for the 3rd season."
1387,"The Duffer Brothers' sci-fi, horror chiller miniseries ""Stranger Things"" reminded me of a half-baked B-movie with its outlandish shenanigans involving a trio of elementary aged children: Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard of ""It""), Dustin Henderson (newcomer Gaten Matarazzo), and Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin of ""Blue Bloods"") who are all searching for their missing school mate Will Byers (Noah Schnapp of ""Bridge of Spies"") who vanished under bizarre circumstances. Will's mother (Winona Ryder of ""Heathers"") is grief-stricken about the loss of her little boy, and she harasses the Hawkins' Police Chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour of ""Quantum of Solace "") to find him. Hopper sends out search parties to comb the surrounding woods. Set during the 1980s with homages to John Carpenter and Stephen King, this Netflix's original series is pretty tame stuff from start to finish. Things, however, do heat up in Episode Six when the monster appears, but Matt and Ross Duffer confine this fiend in the shadows so we cannot see exactly how menacing it is. Indeed, it is slimy and makes munchie sounds. Supernatural elements abound largely because an ultra-secret government-operated laboratory has been conducting unethical experiments on grown-ups and children not far from Hawkins. While Will has gone missing, a girl with closely-cropped hair has managed to escape from the government laboratory. Mike, Dustin, and Lucas find her, and Mike hides her in his house without notifying his parents about their special guest. Eleven has superpowers of a sort. She can move objects and people with his telekinetic mind and she can kill adversaries by breaking their necks. By Episode Six, we learn that the enigmatic child with the number eleven tattooed inside her forearm, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown of ""Godzilla: King of Monsters"") is the daughter of the mad scientist, white-haired Dr. Martin Brenner (Mathew Modine of ""Full Metal Jacket"") and a girl that he conducted experiments on, Terry Ives (Aimee Mullins of ""Quid Pro Quo""), yielded a child. Reportedly, Terry never gave birth, but you'll know better as the series progresses. The three youngsters have to contend with a couple of bullies at school, and these dastards wind up paying a price for giving our heroes a hard time. When the Duffers aren't following the youngsters around, they also have high school students on the loose. Mike's older sister Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer of ""Blue Like Jazz"") runs around with another student, Barb (Shannon Purser of ""Riverdale""), who drives her to a rendezvous with her snotty boyfriend, Steve Harrington (Joe Keery of ""Molly's Game""), who wants to deflower her. The cliffhanger episodes are neither frightening nor suspenseful, and nothing about this series should give anybody a nightmare. Interestingly, this is one of David Harbour's few roles where he isn't cast as villain."
1388,"This show has everything I do NOT want to have in a mystery show, from using every dumb audience-friendly scenario available, every foreseeable action maneuver used in the last thirty-some years, every cliché that falls into the agreed perspective of prepubescent kids, to nearly non-ending senseless quarrel of - again - prepubescent kids, to a hundred percent not frightening monster manifestations, to really not funny scenes and dialogues between said kids and adults, to a totally unimaginative solution and ending, to....well, I could rant about bad things here for a while, and because everyone is so excited about that show, nobody will notice. My review will simply drown in that unimaginable deep sea of epicures of mediocrity.I will not hide that I am not a lover of both S. Spielberg, whose way of storytelling was obviously a prototype here, and S. King, whose way of horror-telling was a prototype too, but of course I appreciate their greatest works, like 'Duel' and 'Shining'(by courtesy of Stanley Kubrick, of course).What they both have in common is their great nose for what the people want, which is equal to having a nose for making money.The producers of this show are obviously on the same wavelength like their models, thus landing a hit with something so flat and hollow that it evaporates immediately after watching, as opposed to provoke some thoughts at least.The script and story felt for me literally coming out of a construction kit for television hit producers, there was not one scene or one thing going on, that I hadn't seen before elsewhere.Normally I give disasters like this two or three stars here, but three stars are for the child actors, first of all, of course, Millie B. Brown. A rare talent, who manages to say everything with such few words, at her age, that is really remarkable, in a show which is otherwise completely unremarkable."
1389,"First problem i had with this show was why make it a period piece? I felt like it was trying to say to me THIS was how E.T. should have been done. Later i realized that it wasn't (necessarily) meant to compete with E.T., they just wanted to make a script that didn't have to allow for cell phones, car computers, etc. They should have been more careful with the script, tho'...too much modern-day slang kinda grated on me.Next problem i had was with the teenage sex scene. It just didn't really seem appropriate In a show where prepubescents were the stars, and presumably the audience.Next, the pacing felt odd to me, as did the character development, and the plot revelations.On the other hand, this show does have all the necessary elements for both fantasy and horror, and if nothing about it happens to bug you, you should enjoy it greatly.For me, however, Netflix original productions still need very good sci-fi and fantasy epics to complete their collection.Please don't think of this as a bad review; I'm spoiled, this is the golden age of shows...and a series i would have been wild over 10 years ago, is only slightly better than mediocre with the current levels of competition."
1390,"You know everyone told me to watch this show and that it was one of the best shows they have ever watched, all of that is a lie. This show just does everything wrong. Instead of using actual good actors they use kids, and everyone knows that kids are just awful actors. On top of this it doesn't even have any good jump scares which is what makes a good horror movie. And the cherry on top of this pile of garbage is the awful writing it is just frustrating to see a decent idea be abused like this, maybe one day writers will actually learn what their audience wants."
1391,"Stranger Things is the perfect blend of 80s nostalgia and science fiction. And while the first season is undoubtedly the best, the second season still prove to be a fun time.
Unfortunately, the show falls down in the third season, as the tension and complex character building is pushed aside for cheap jokes and lacklustre storylines. This isn't to say its a fun time, it's just not comparable with the seasons that came before.
Hopefully the Duffer brothers can recapture the magic for season four."
1392,"The best ever series in Netflix,All seasons are very well written and good actors, always stranger things will be top compared to other tv shows. Eagerly waiting for s4"
1393,"Stranger things is a show that began pretty good but started to go downhills. When s1 ended I was very satisfied. But as always when a show makes alot of money it gets a new season. S2 was really meh, i really don't remember much about it because meh. S3, the peek of good-show-becomes-bad which only good points were the actors and the costumes.So, in conclusion good-show-becomes-bad is bad and so is stranger things.(In regards of s4 i am curious to see how much of a downfall stranger things have become so i shall watch it)"
1394,"My most favorite tv show! And it only gets better! Lots of bad language and a few hidden jokes, but I'd say it's perfect for anyone that loves to combine action, drama and comedy."
1395,"All 3 seasons till now was masterpiece!The music and intro was phenomenal,the story-line was great the twists and drama was amazing at peak,the visuals,cinematography and CGI was great,acting was iconic winona ryder her face was literally adorable and amazingly performed and every character was having there roles quite amazing ad played well.season was thrilling and engaging as we are introducing whats everything then season 2 was same patterned but engaging then season 3 felt literally out of the world it was most amazing season the characters growned and the story-line shifts little and theme and colors in whole season was skeptical specially in last episode great and heart warming to watch the will's childhood thing i relate to that the whole season was roller-coaster ride and then the ending episode i was literally shocked and blowned it was amazing episode ever the speech and hint just it was enough to make next season hyped!overall whole series was entertainingly mind bendingly Awesome ""Masterpiece""."
1396,Stranger things is netflix's best show and better than ever!!!!!!!!
1397,"It is a very good series, very easy to follow the story line and it wasn't very predictable which is really good. All the actors portrayed their characters really good which made it feel so real"
1398,"It´s like you realy were in 80' . The atmosphere, story, music, characters."
1399,"I only liked season 1. When I watched season 2 I didn't like it at all, bad storyline.
Waste of time. As a result I don't watch stranger things anymore. I like The Witcher much better."
1400,"I will be the first to say that I had my reservations after the first few episodes of season 3. The first two seasons had craftily set up the town of Hawkins and everyone ( and everything ) that resides in it. This season was slow to build, but for a very good reason. Up until episode four, we have many plots going on at once with different groups, and I am happy to say that the wait was SO worth it.Pros-
-the actor for Billy ( Dacre Montgomery ) delivered a fantastic performance as the conflicted and terrifying mind flayer inhabiting him. His death while very sad to watch was the character arc anyone could have hoped for for him.
-Starcourt mall served as a good representation of what the 80's truly had to offer for teenagers. Vibrant, culturally relevant, and a good setting to hold scenes, it was a great addition to Hawkins
-Steve, Robin, and Erica offered witty dialogue and hilarious conversations to keep the episodes light hearted when needed. Which brings me to my last point...
-This season was immensely darker, which I LOVED. The kids were growing, and so was the mind flayer and the Russian enemies Millie once again delivered an incredible performance as Eleven and the final sacrifices of Alexie, Billy, and Hopper truly were the cherries on top. The season still ended with enough questions to carry to season 4. The ""heart to heart"" letter brought me to tears and could be related to for any age.My only real complaints that lowered my score was the fact that there was a slow build up, the mayor unfortunately did not offer more than being a very large nuisance ( which made me sad because The Princess Bride is one of my favorite movies ), and finally the tribute to the neverending story moment between Dustin and Suzie was cute, it was poorly placed in a crucial moment and arguably could have contributed to the death of Billy."
1401,"I write this shortly after finishing season 3. For me, 2-ond was best, 1-st was very good, and 3-rd - too unoriginal, cliche, uninventive alien scenes ...
Unlike many I don't think that S3 ep1 was worst. For me worst were S3 ep5 and 6. Partially because not good direction. Fight scenes were just lame, some car crashes too.I guess, I need to watch again season 1 - if nothing else because I missed song Should I Stay or Should I go - nothing from it in season 3 :-)"
1402,"I'm currently watching season 2 for the first time (I'm on episode 4), and I gotta say I find it even better than the first one, which I saw when it debuted in 2016 (I don't know why I waited so long to watch season 2 or why I seem to have forgotten about this series, since I really love it). This season is ""stranger"", more mature, complex, and artistic than the first one, which says a lot, for season 1 was nothing short of spectacular (yes, the plot and the ideas are somewhat recycled from other TV shows or movies, but it's the execution, storytelling, production values, and attention to detail that make it so compelling and entertaining to watch).I was born in 1988 and it's very interesting and nostalgic to watch a TV show set in this decade with such ""realism"" (I'm European, but the idea and memories I have from the 80's aren't far from what is portrayed in the show - clothes, games, bicycles, cars, songs, etc.). It's a joy to watch all those scenes with those wonderful songs from that period in the background. I can only imagine the fun the younger actors had shooting the series (to think they weren't even born in the 20th century and still managed to be convincing in their roles full of geeking out stuff... it's remarkable).Last but not least, the acting. I know everyone praises Millie Brown for her acting skills, and rightly so. But I believe the big star of this season is Noah Schnapp. I'm amazed by how such a great actor he is. I find myself constantly realizing that he steals almost every scene he is in (and even overshadows Winona in the scenes they have together, and she is a veteran). His portrayal of feelings like fear, despair, confusion, horror, sadness, and sorrow is astonishing, to the point one forgets he's acting and that he's just a kid. I can only think of Haley Joel Hosment (as a kid, in the Sixth Sense) with the same talent to convey such psychological and emotional complexity (and even more so, at such young age) so magnificently. I hope the rest of the season keeps delivering such greatness. I sure am looking forward already to watch season 3."
1403,"I had to jump ahead with the book, and season Three is Here y'all! I'm so excited I set myself! This is one of the more favorable Spielberg type films to hit the TV screen in ages. Hang on for a rough ride this season, as your every fear will be highlighted and ignighted this time! Enjoy, pax, Murf"
1404,"Don't get me wrong, Stranger Things is a good show with neat ideas, but it's also a huge rip-off 2011's ""Super 8"". On top of that, I personally feel like it's just as busy shamelessly playing on young people's false nostalgia of the 80's (D&D, Poltergeist, Ghostbusters, Star Wars, Toto, etc.) as it is with building its intricate universe. On top of that, I feel it to be pretty overrated.C+"
1405,"Overall, this is a pretty solid show. The first season set up the world very nicely, and the second season expanded and greatly improved upon it. The story is structured nicely, and even just a few episodes into the first season I found myself caring about these characters and their issues. The story was articulated well and was very detailed, and clearly has the capacity to not only answer questions, but not only bring up more. I also particularly enjoyed the attention to detail like putting up political signs of the era and having popular 80s songs prominently portrayed in the soundtrack. The cinematography is pretty solid with some really impressive shots and action sequences. The CGI is also really solid, with all of the creatures having a very real presence in the scene and nothing seeming out of place or fake-looking, Netflix clearly put a lot of time, money and resources into the production of this show. Both seasons 1 and 2 have some fantastic acting, including many child actors, almost all the characters were portrayed very well and some standout stars including Winona Ryder, Millie Bobby Brown, Noah Schnapp, and Finn Wolfhard. And while I could praise this show for many paragraphs on all the things it did right it is still not a perfect show in my mind. For one, the soundtrack is a little cheesy at times, making sure to let us know when a jump-scare is coming (something I was hoping this show would rise above seeing how it defies almost every other horror drama trope). And the jump scares themselves are another thing that I feel I don't even need to touch on, just that if you watch the show, you will probably notice them and be upset. Another issue is yet another horror trope of characters making stupid decisions seemingly for the plot's sake. And especially when those characters stupid decisions bring about a dramatic shift in the story, it's especially annoying. Also, it's kind of hard to portray the creatures as really dangerous and scary when it's obvious that none of the main characters are in any real dangers. Sure they kill off some of the side characters here and there, but they honestly waited a little long to do so. And the one character they did kill off in season 2 only died because he did the stupidest thing he could do in that situation. There are other little things, but I think you get the point that even though this show is not perfect, I still think it's pretty freaking amazing. I'm excited for season 3, and I'm excited for more Netflix original programming. And that's why I'm giving this series so far a 9/10."
1406,"SPOILERS AHEAD...I decided on watching this after my typical preview of the boring blah blah on Netflix. Netflix watchers rated it pretty high and I enjoy this creepy, weird genre.Decided to stream it via my BluRay box but the TV's cinema settings were a bit wonky so I watched S1 on my PC.Watching the pilot and the subsequent episode I recognized 2 names from previous movies; Winona Ryder and Matthew Modine. The rest of the cast were a bunch of newbies.The feel I got was 'what the hell am I watching? Stephen King? John Carpenter? Steven Spielberg? After S1E2 I started getting this bad headache. The splish-splosh of themes and mish mosh of various movie directions started to ring in my mind like a great bell.This bell rang until the very end. So what was Stranger Things? A huge extrapolation of various works by various directors and mushed into this TV series called ""Stranger Things"" - Aliens meets Hemlock Grove meets E.T. is this Stranger Things.Since there was nothing else on Netflix, I watched all of Season 1 in one sitting. Just to be objective. It really was meh.No wonder this is just on Netflix, it would never survive on its own."
1407,"I haven't really been a fan of Netflix originals apart from How to make a murderer, Narcos and Bloodlines, but after watching the trailer for this I had big expectations. And man, i was not let down! Watching these 8 episodes has been one hell of a ride. This show got everything. Great cast, tremendous acting, a true 80's feel and the highest level of excitement you will get in a TV show. The story is really, really good! Can't wait for Season 2. If you haven't watched it yet you are in for a treat. The ratings don't lie! I love everything about this show. The soundtrack is amazing. This show really takes me back to the 80s. Someone mentioned it's like a mix of x-files and E.T and he is right, only this is even better than those two combines. I think it has a Guilerme Del Toro feel to it, but that does not by any means mean it's not original. it is!"
1408,"Stranger things does almost everything perfectly for me. The characters are excellently written and as viewers we feel like we know them as people. The storylines themselves are also very cleverly written and whilst being based on science fiction almost feel unique in the way the genre has been approached. Another thing this series does superbly is it does not make the characters feel invincible and there is a genuine fear that anything could happen to anyone at any moment. It also gets a big tick in the humour box for me and the majority of the jokes land within the series. The only reason this isn't a 10 for me is because in a few episodes there some odd artistic choices but that is pretty by the by. If you're looking for a new series to fall in love with both the story and characters look no further, you won't be disappointed!"
1409,As a person who grew up in the 80's and as a SCI-FI fan to me it's the best tv show ever!! It has everything! I can't wait to see what the genius Duffer Brothers have planned for us in season 4.
1410,"I can't get enough of this series and I absolutely love getting lost in it.
It's a show I can watch multiple times like Game of Thrones.
Very well done and fantastic acting!"
1411,"I didn't have much of an expectation, but.... i was amazed by the quality of this show! Can't remember when was the last time a watched something SF that's this good! Honestly would recomend to watch!"
1412,"Stranger Things is the newest foray into Netflix's original programming, of which brings us their most impressive- and strange- production to date. When a young boy named Will Byers goes missing, his friends, mother and the town are thrust into a conspiracy involving a mysterious girl named Eleven and something even more sinister hiding in the woods of Hawkins, Indiana.From the get-go, you can tell this is an homage to classic '80s Spielberg, drawing on E.T. and Close Encounters, as well as JJ Abrams' Super 8. But, as the show progresses, it becomes more and more like a twisted Stephen King story set in a Spielberg movie. It becomes a dark and twisted ride into an even darker and more disturbing world where the stakes feel higher than anything before it.I can't go into great detail because spoiling even just a bit of the story takes away from the greater mystery, but I can say, it's one of the most thrilling and intense series to be on TV, without being on TV. If it were to continue, they have to pull the same punches they did with the first season, because they took a great many clichés, and somehow made them fresh and surprising, save for just a couple that they purposefully left cliché."
1413,"I liked Season 3. Many reviewers here seem to think that Russia/USSR was just another country, and that Stranger Things is picking on them or something. But no: the Soviets were our enemy. They were the bad guys. So their portrayal, though cartoonish, makes perfect sense."
1414,I first watched this show when it was first released in 2016 and I was hooked. I have loved this show for so long and not everything is perfect but this show seems so unique and FUN! Season 2 and 3 are very different seasons but in the best way possible and I couldn't recommend it enough! Acting and visuals are fantastic and I'm satisfied with how the series left off....
1415,"Let me explain first. I am a big fun of sci-fi pictures - not only from the 80's - but this is not a good one. OK if you like ET, X-files, Cocoon and similar films then you probably like this one. But if you seek for real sci-fi suspense then stay away. So much fuss for nothing. OK I must say that Mrs. Rhyder tries hard and kids act decent but that's all. I prefer go and watch again the Goonies or Philadelphia experiment.. Slow, spiritless, nerveless and without inspiration."
1416,"It's time for #realtalk. STRANGER THINGS is OVERRATED. Apparently everyone looking down the barrel of turning 40 years old decided they needed nostalgic rejuvenation and rode this TV-PG ""boner for the 80's"" all week. Even at 8 eps it runs too long. The story could have easily been told as a movie. And it's so intentionally filled with cliché -- if I have to see a black hole explained with a folded piece of paper & a pencil thru it ONE MORE TIME! -- that it tastes stale and feels exaggeratedly sentimental. That said, there is some fun in watching the show, just know it's family friendly TV and not a dark or dramatic story aimed at adults. But the fun isn't enough to carry it for 8 hours."
1417,"I do not understand the hype with this show. Perfect material for a teenage night get-together to watch some cheap horror. The acting is terrible - especially that Nancy girl - every time she comes up I just cringe. The story-line is ridiculously slow and juvenile themed. If you are a high school-er or younger this might be acceptable entertainment, as I see the target viewing market for this a crowd between 12 and 18 years of age maximum. There is not much depth on the adult characters and their interaction - even Winona is only seen screaming and not much else is explored about her persona. It would have been nice to have seen more scenes with the kids parents, or more filming inside the police station...adult interaction in general. Stay away from this, do not believe the hype. I just wasted a few hours I will never get back."
1418,"So Just Completed Season 3 and Let me tell you This is one hell of a Ride. So Awesome Show , After Disappointing GOT Finale I was a Bit spectacle abot S3 of Stranger Things and it completely blew me away.What an Acting , Production is top Notch and what strengthen it is great storytelling .So Leave everything and Binge watch this Epic"
1419,Season 3 is so far the best season. Loved every single episode. 👌🏾
1420,During season three I was laughing so hard through almost every scene. Season three is probably their best season yet!!!
1421,"This is what we call ""Entertainment to the core"". Never boring. Best Series to watch with your family. It's not an 18+ series. This is my favorite series till date along with dark series."
1422,"Where were the writers? I mean the one who started this story with this ""suspense"" in the ""Hitchcockian"" meaning of the word. This was so intense!
They obviously went for the coffe and the movie did carry on as in a terrible Starsky and Hutch kind of way.
The really mean Russians spies who don't speak English in a mall??! Really? The robocop villain that seems to blackmail a corrupt mayor that we only see for ten minutes having his ass kicked by a police man who turned into John Wayne !!! It's not even funny!! Dialogs became yell jokes to each other like crazy people!!! To compensate the moves that are being edited to give tension but instead are dilating time, replacing the abuse slow motion of the second season...
My god that used to be good and characters used to be interesting.
No really too baaaaaaaaaaad"
1423,"The first season is worth the watch. Only problem with the entire show after season one is it entirely sucks. The show becomes more centred around the kids and those same characters you liked in season one start to pis your off. Now it just feels like a chick flick or kid tv show.
Season 3 was an Absolute joke."
1424,"Pros: Cool zombielike movie, and evil character is very original.Cons: Winona Ryder, Max and some of the kids' acting is terrible, and plot is so unrealistic, is like, everytime there is something spooky going on instead of people trying get help from authorities like police or army, they try to solve the puzzle own their own, and where is the army anyways when there is an alien invasion from different dimension.. and russians build a mile elevator inside the US soil secretly without the US government knowing it... give me a break.."
1425,No 1 Web series FROM Netflix snsnsndnszjxjxxhxhzhxhxxhzhshzhzhzzhzhzh
1426,"WARNING.!!! IF YOU'VE an epileptic condirion, neuropathy or photosensitive eye neurons.....be very careful watching season three, episode three. There are warnings that it can cause a reaction in some people, prone to seizures from photophobia etc.....I started feeling nauseous somewhat myself too. It's a great drama however and you just can't beat good old American ingenuity on CGI effects! Enjoy, Murf"
1427,This is the film I feel like im in the 80s! All the vivid colors and shots. Great acting as previous 2 seasons. Watched on OLED TV is 101% money worth for the experience! WELL DONE NETFILX!!!
1428,"ET, It, Super 8, Goonies. Old boring idea! I think we are seen it all! Nothing new. Kids are great, all 4 stars for them! Why boy acting girl role??? I don't see reason to somebody make something like this. I think is very less ideas is left in Hollywood, and product is ""Stranger Things"". Old, boring, predictive story,with no exciting finale, predictably ending."
1429,"I don't understand the hype behind this show nor the praise. I don't understand what critics find so special about it. I believe this is one of the most overrated series on IMDb and it is a shame it got renewed for a second season. It has all the clichés of horror movies, whether in the poorly developed characters' behaviour or in some scenes that felt like a horror parody. The show lacks originality and feels like a weird mix between Silent Hill, The Goonies, and E.T.Stranger things is the kind of series that keeps you watching with cliffhangers while nothing really happens. The first season ended with a good episode just to give you the impression that you have not wasted your time and in the end you had a good time.The only bright side about this show was the amazing performances by David Harbour and Gaten Matarazzo. Appreciating this show and enjoying it simply amounts to intellectual masturbation and nostalgia for the 1980s."
1430,"whole story is great. I loved the concept of the series but it is not at all original concept as it is taken from the movie INSIDIOUS. since i loved the concept of the movie i loved it too. The main difference between the concept of the movie and 'stranger things' is that there are monsters on the other side of the world which is stated as 'the upside down', and in the movie it is the devil itself in 'the further'. Another thing i would like to share is that in the series the monsters are kill-able which is good from the perspective of a kid. Overall great experience watching the series. waited for long, for such a great experience. Thanks to all the ones who made this awesome series. Excellent work guys, keep it up."
1431,"The performances of all the cast are super great and leaves an impression on the audience, especially child actors, with whom you can totally relate as the kids of the era shown in the series. What an enthusiasm every character carries. It is a great delight to watch and of course is addictive too! Cinematography is at its peak, great."
1432,One of the best shows out there. If you like scifi pranomal activity type of shows this is a great one.
1433,"This show is sooo good, i love it so muchh!! 100% recommend. i watched it so many times because it's so good!"
1434,"Does this season reuse some of the things we love about the other seasons? Yes. Does that feel a little redundant at times? Yes. But, and if you're a GOT fan, you'll understand this, I would have been so disappointed if this season suddenly went in another direction. I could feel them setting up for season 4 and I appreciated that. I would much rather the story like repeat a little while understandably transitioning the characters in many ways. So, I think this season did exactly what it was meant to do, and I can't wait to see season 4, and the characters and plot grow at a reasonable rate."
1435,"Breathtaking!
This may just be the best show on Netflix. Everything is fantastic. The show is set in the 1980's, and that works well with the plot devices and really makes the show possible. The characters on this show are very well fleshed out, and they all feel like real people, even minor characters that are only present in 1 or 2 scenes. The pacing on the show is also fantastic. The show only tells the viewer little bits of information, enough that they know what is going on, but not too much that it just gives away the answers. This keeps the show interesting. The acting is great too... You have to watch it!"
1436,"Netflix's attempt at a 80s mystery series has proven to be one of the best of all time. The series is slow paced. Binge-watching the 3 seasons has been not really the most pleasant experience. At the time of this review, the fourth season is still waiting to be released. Some scenes with gore are present, albeit not excessive and not a lot. As a person who saw TV-14 with expectations of fighting scenes and minimal blood, this came as a fit for me."
1437,The first 2 seasons are great but season three is mediocre minus the last episode. Wish the whole season was more like the last episode.
1438,"So I didn't start watching this show until about 6/7 weeks before season 3 came out, but in that time I've watched the main show (excluding season 3) 5-6 times (I lost count) and the after show beyond stranger things twice, this show has consumed my life haha.Fan boying aside this show is a perfect mix of sci-fi, horror, drama and good hearted fun. The acting is amazing especially from the kids, the writing is incredible, the soundtrack is impeccable.I truely thank everyone involved in this show from the duffer brothers to the actors to the camera men for creating such a master piece."
1439,"The first season was amazing. Second season, eh. After David Harbour's overly theatrical and racist diatribe promoting violence against all non-liberals I can no longer support this program. It's too bad, the kids are great, even Winona was awesome."
1440,"For starters, guys who glorify this series shall use the money they've received for it to buy some taste, knowledge and experience. This show is really nothing special. Some Super 8, some Star Wars, some Stephen King, some Goonies ... Nothing original and creative. Lacks humor. Winona Ryder is overacting. Kids are OK but aren't they in any show? David Harbour is OK - seems to me he was the only one to find measure in dosing his efforts. Credits shall also got to Billie Bobby Brown. The show is too slow and basically nothing really happens until the last episode, when again nothing significant happens. Everything seems like: ""Guys, write something in a way that it ends or not in the first season, depending on advertisers and money income."" Everything in this show is black & white. Good guys are good, bad are bad (as in Government), naive and stupid are naive and stupid and so on. Too many clichés. Childish at best.Not worth watching and certainly not worth another season. Forget this ever happened and I'll try to forgive the Duffer brothers. Do we have a deal?"
1441,"This show is not horrible, but I feel it is an insult to every writer of every 80's hit movie or show of which this current series rips off and they are not being credited and paid for whatever success 'Stranger Things' might achieve.It's almost like the writers were smart enough to pick up on all the winning plot lines of 30 years ago, throw them in a bag and then stitch this story together and because it is playing to the nostalgia of every 80's kid, they are getting unwarranted standing ovations for their barely not plagiarized storytelling. Throw in some 80's stars a la Wynona Rider ( I keep waiting for Wynona *Poltergeist Diane* to tell her son *poltergiest Carolanne* to run to the light)and Matthew Modine to make the potion complete and everyone is under some strange love spell. It's the worst kind of Hollywood emotional blackmail.I was even looking forward to seeing Wynona in this but she's just OTT with the acting and now I wish she would join Drew Barrymore, Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner for some acting classes that would not only benefit them but possibly make our having to watch them bearable.It's goonies meets x-files meets poltergeist meets e.t. meets alien meets stand by me etc etc etc It's unfortunate the writers could not have been more original with 'their' ideas."
1442,"Basically a total ripoff of Steven King but so much worse.
Bad writing, bad directing, seriously bad casting, bad acting And no trust in the story.
There is a few really good characters an a whole lot of really, really, really bad caracters."
1443,I don't understand what is the motive of a show which doesnt hook you up or makes you excited. The plot is very boring and slow.The only good thing is acting and cinematography that's it.
1444,"I seriously thing, People need to grow up. And give respect to the real talent."
1445,This show has always only been okay... Everything about it is at best pretty good.
1446,"I don't understand the criticisms this show got in reviews on here for declining quality in S2 and S3. My wife and I have absolutely loved every single moment of all 3 series. and we bulk-watched the whole lot in 2 weeks.It's very imaginative, extremely fast-paced and has enough moments of humor to mean each episode is engrossing and a lot of fun. I consider The X-Files an 24 to be the finest TV I've watched, and this is certainly on a par with those.There is just enough character development to get attached to the cast and care about them, and the special effects are believable. I also love the way it has researched the years which it is set in, it has had me googling products and historical moments to remind me of my childhood.Now I have the pain of having to wait for S4 to arrive!"
1447,"Really worth watching series 1 is exciting, series 2 is even better, series 3 is just as good as 2 can't wait for number 4 if you want to get hooked on a series this is the drug for you."
1448,"Well, first season was great, second was ok, third was unwatchable and extremely stupid. Characters are not themselves anymore, plot is boring and stupid. If you gonna watch it, watch only first season and you won't be disappointed."
1449,"The first season was a brilliant amalgamation of story telling and 80s nostalgia, but it's now become a plainly written mess. Season 2 was weak for a load of reasons, and whilst season 3 was definately an improvement it felt really flat. This is defo a show that needs to end."
1450,"Enter the world of Stranger Things, and you will be riveted to your screen for the entire time. The series has gone through three seasons and each one is great, though I would argue that the first season is the best. The series focuses on four friends during the 80's. They are living in a small town, and the only cop that gets any air time comes upon a young girl. Her head is shaved and she is in a hospital gown. He takes her in and she befriends the boys. Meanwhile there is another dimension trying to force it's way into our realm. This comes to be known as the upside down. All three seasons deal, in varying degrees, with the kids trying to fight against this invasion. The young girl, called eleven and another girl end up joining in with the boys. I can not really say much more without giving away some plot points, so I will end the description there.
To say that since season one I struggle to wait for the next season is an understatement. This is probably my favorite TV series of all time."
1451,Screen play just superb... All the actors did very Good job... Graphics was superb... Every episodes gives you Goosebumps... I just loved it 😍🙏🇮🇳🇮🇳
1452,the visual effects and set design improve each seasonthe scare/intensity factor is therethe acting/relationship amongst the characters gets better with each seasonthe story never seems bland or sluggisheach season ends with you wanting more
1453,"You may think: next season will be less cool or even bad, but It just won't. Loving every episode. The 80's setting Is superb. Nostalgia guaranteed. Super reccomended."
1454,"I am giving season3 an 8 just because of Dacre and Millie's amazing acting performances + their characters story archs. Their storylines where the highlight of the season. Both of them had the most complex characters, having to portray various emotions during every episode and they absolutely nailed it. The scene where the mind flayer is speaking through Millie was so well acted, by far the best scene of the whole season.I guess i am in the minority but i absolutely disliked Robin and Erica. Both characters were way too over the top, to the point they seemed cartoonish. Every sentence that came out of their mouth was a punch line. They were also rude and condescending to everyone the point that i am wondering how on earth would Dustin and Steve want to be friends with them. Bad writing i guess. The whole Scoops gangs underground adventure was so bad, it seemed like a very bad comedy skit. Dustin was reduced to an unintelligent dog, where in previous seasons he was the one solving a lot of the mysteries.The music this season was phenomenal. Loved Alexei and Murray."
1455,"Loved it cause it's magnificent simplicity and in predicted at the same time ,feels like a vivid comic book , waiting for season 4, as I'm Already addicted"
1456,Totally 80 flashback! If you like horror Science-fiction and the 80s.
1457,Not the masterpiece that everyone says it is characters lack depth generic storyline and also bland
1458,"Gone: charming children, solid writing, comedic relief, solid writing...did I mention solid writing? This thing feels forced, right down to the forced comedic moments by gangly, awkward pre-teens...relies too heavily on 80's-90's themes and music, and when you realize there is only 2 episodes left and they haven't gone anywhere, you've wasted your time. Everything in season two is a cliché or is beyond literal for the times. Uncomfortable watch, complete with annoying pre-teens, bad acting all around, rushed script writing, bad special effects, and lac of tension/release.If this were condensed into a 2 hour film, no one would watch it...seems series always get a pass for very flawed work."
1459,"Stranger Things is an 80's style horror show that deals with the adventures of 4 kids that uncover the mystery of the disappearance of their friend, while encountering a very strange little girl named eleven. There's a lot to love about this show. If you grew up in the 80's and miss that old style of horror movies, then this will refresh your memory in a satisfying and albeit entertaining way. All of the kids do an outstanding job especially Finn Wolfhard and Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. The adults also do a good job like Winona Ryder. The monster was also very cool and creepy and was very well designed. This show also reminded me of a Stephen King story, there's a lot of Stephen King formulas in here.And that is all of the positives that make this show worth while of seeing. But...with that being said, i do think this show is a tad bit overrated. I love this show like the next person on the block, but i don't think its one of the best shows ever created (like how IMDb depicts it). So in conclusion, Stranger Things is a wonderful show that will bring back all of your memories of the 80's as it is well acted, evenly creepy, creative with its ideas, and well preformed. A- or 9/10"
1460,"When I saw Stranger Things had a really high score rating, my expectations were raised. Considering this show had many positive reviews, I assumed there would be something outstanding in this show, or some sort of mind-blowing component. I was disappointed. This show barely lived up to my expectations, and it just came off as a rushed, poorly directed alien monster show. There were no wow-factors or anything that took me breath away. Everything was predictable, and they did not leave much up to the viewers to figure out. This, of course, is my personal opinion. One man's trash is another man's treasure. In this case, it was trash."
1461,"Don't misunderstand me. This TV series is by no means bad. But it is definitely not worth more than 6 stars. By all means, it has its merits. There is good acting, good special effects, and the children are not at all annoying. But what really ground my gears was the uneven pacing. There are entire episodes when nothing noteworthy happens and the plot does not progress at all. I mean this TV series has only eight episodes to begin with but it still was a huge effort to watch it all because of all the tedious bits. Additionally, the plot is extremely predictable. There were a few twists and revelations on the way but they were never surprising and you could actually see them from a mile away. At first I was intrigued by all the mystery around eleven at the beginning of the show, but her background and her connection to the other dimension became clear rather quickly. Some people might like it because of all the throw- backs to the 80s, but not being a child from this era, I did not feel nostalgic about that, but others might enjoy the show due to exactly these references. Furthermore, the story had the potential to be really scary but apart from the odd jump-scare you will not get frightened at all. So, in my opinion, it was really quite boring and I will not watch the second season."
1462,"For someone who doesn't love the 80s nostalgia (probably as I was not alive for them!) I was pleasantly surprised to find myself quickly immersed by the set dress and of course the amazing soundtrack. The casting and acting is fantastic especially eleven and the kids (I was even able to overcome my Winona Ryder aversion). However, I wasn't hooked until the 3-4th episode and that was short lived. I soon became bored of the cheesy cliché storyline, especially anything involving the teenagers, and the nods toward classic scifi and horror took over; leaving the plot unoriginal. Though in all I enjoyed the classic story, I feel it was tired and nothing special or worth the hype surrounding it. There was no major character arcs and the audience was too many steps ahead of the cast...leaving me frustrated. In my opinion the best thing about the show is the opening credits."
1463,"I loved this show ""Stranger Things'(no spoilers below). It was a real nostalgia trip, with some excellent and strong performances by many child actors as well as from Winona Ryder and the many adult veteran actors in its strong ensemble cast. Great suspense, a plot and narrative that moves quickly and likable characters that you can't help empathize with. There are also some dastardly villains and plenty off a$%^% holes to hate and many people in between - the characterization was spot on. I LOVED the setting. The nostalgia trip for the period is intoxicating, there's also some cool off-beat humour with the Goonies-like gang (who I find to be actually more likable than the kids in the Goonies). Their Camaraderie anchors the series - I did not regret staying up all night watching. As a former Dungeon Master myself (briefly), I could relate to the Dungeons & Dragons references, and I feel they used the motif well to accompany the plot and themes of the story.Would like to see a 2nd season."
1464,"This is real good! binged watched the 8 chapters. The only thing I found was the AV teacher roof on his house has dimensional shingles; not available in the 70tys or early 80tys. But I won't nitpick, the acting is good, the story keeps your attention. The story does have holes but everyone is not me and may not take notice. I will be watching for these new talented young actors. Set in a small town filled with nuclear family's living sheltered lives in Cul-de-sac neighborhoods. And of course you have your top secret Government agency conducting mind alternation experiments on young subjects with trails of misconception and cover ups. A chain smoking sheriff with a broken past. The so called creepy kid that works to support his Mom & little brother. And a gang of 11 ish boys with creative imaginations. This is a mishmash full of sci-fi a little bit of the best, X files,Fire starter,Alien, ET, The Goonies."
1465,"This is best show I have been watched in my life 🙀I really entertained watching show..
First it looked me little bit boring but after 2 or 3 episodes I fell in love with it 😚
Really good story and 90's time theme was really good
Thats all for this amazing show
Im really excited for next season ✌.."
1466,"This is one of the best shows on Netflix it is so addicting, you get attached to every character even the ones that are only in for a few episodes like Alexei, but the story for each season is unbelievable and very well written, the special effects even though there isn't many is great. Towards the end of season 3 it is very emotional I won't say why as I try not to give spoilers but this show is simply great. 10/10"
1467,"This show is more Howard the Duck then the miniseries It, it's never scary and aims more to be cute and nostalgic then actually dark and scary. The plot falls apart if you start asking questions, the main little girl actress is so overrated it's insane. Also this show is a clear 100% ripoff of an amazing movie called BEYOND THE BLACK RAINBOW"
1468,Amazing show with a strong scifi background.The show keeps you engaged with its plot which is intense and dark.The thrill is always there and it feels good watching the show.The characters are pleasant and fun watching.Well the X factor of the show is eleven(played by millie bobby brown) which I would say is also one of the main characters of the show.There a multiple storyline which and each storyline keeps you engaged and never disappoints.The Steve-Dustin duo is also the best in the show and they they add a lot of humor in the show.To sum it up one of the best scifi show which you can bingewatch peacefully.
1469,One of the best series doese it again. Season 3 might be one of the best seasons in any serie.
1470,"This show could have been terrific except it does exactly what we all laugh about bad horror movies. It has characters that do the stupidest things just so the story can continue. Two examples: The Sheriff decides to break into the CIA/NSA Dep't of Energy facility alone, with no idea where he's going or who he may come up against. AND, of course he finds nothing of value but does allow the CIA to bug his trailer. Then Karen Wheeler, in the woods at night with Jonathan, decides to climb through a wall of goo ALONE, to go inside a mysterious tree. She doesn't first call Jonathan to show him what she found,and maybe go in together or tell someone, like the Sheriff. No, instead she climbs through this goo into a tree trunk ALL BY HERSELF. And she's supposed to be one of the smartest students at school. Give me a break!!! It's garbage like this that ruins a show."
1471,"This could have been amazing, could have been really memorable, but it just isn't. These TV series have done so many things right - good cast, good acting, great cinematography, great music, great storytelling, decent dialogues. The plot ruins everything. It's just so incredibly simple and straightforward, it pains me. There's no mystery, no plot twist, it's like riding on a train through a desert. You can predict how all of it is going to end from like episode 2 or 3. I expected so much more, considering how high rated these series are. They could have gone in so many different and interesting ways, but for some reason they chose the story that has been told a billion times. Experiments in a lab open a portal through which monsters come out is so 1980. Oh wait, was that your grand plan? Booooring."
1472,"I truly loved this show. When I began watching I was under the impression I would get scared watching it (as I'm a big scaredy cat )but i was wrong ! This show was quite suspenful. A lot of the other reviews say stuff about it getting bad after the first or second season but I quite enjoyed every season. In fact, I thought it got better as the seasons came! I actually cried at this show during the last episode, which I usually never do. I cannot wait to see season 4. I'm sure the actors, producers and everyone else will do a spectacular job at creating another amazing season. I would recommend this show to anyone above the age of 10 ( If your on the younger side though it could get a bit scary at times). 10/10 my favorite show!"
1473,Watch the first season is fantastic . the rest not much
1474,"Do I really need to say more? The 80's theme takes me back to my childhood and screams everything that was cool plus mad action scenes, wicked humour and great casting! Can't wait for the new season."
1475,"I really like this series
But the bad thing is the season is very short I and Many barely finish this season in 2 days And they make it soo slow2019 season 3 2021 season 4
2 years for 8 episodes ??? Atleast release it fast"
1476,I love every episode in every season. I don't see why people are so dissapointed... I can't wait for season 4 and i hope everyone else feel the same.
1477,"This series is one of the best ideal for the kids who were born after 2000 and somehow missed the craze of Harry Potter.
Its not as equal as HP movies. Still the idea of sticking up with friends no matter what in a world where everyone is wearing glasses of self goodness and depression, that's where it rang the bell. And introduced todays youngs who cool things were before snapchat and weeds came.
And a group of nerds has not to be boring and book driven always. They also can be cool if they want to.
But I will recommend not to watch season 3.
It doomed all. Why series like this extends I don't understand. All the cast did very bad acting tbh.
And the charm of 80s vanished as well. Some scenes gave me nausea."
1478,"I'm generally avoiding movies/series with kids characters as they normally do too much stupid stuff, however this one is not like that. The first season was 10/10, 2nd - about 9/10 due to few blips, but in 3rd one they really dropped the ball - 5/10 at best. This season has all the flaws of an average movie, lacks tension, darkness - basically all the things present in S1/2. I hope they will recover in the 4th and keep it up afterwards as the story itself is very appealing."
1479,"Watched Season 1 and decided that was enough.Half decent plot, but executed at a desperately, crawlingly, S - L - O - W pace and with some good acting performances but too many downers, like the half-witted plot devices involving squabbling kids or bickering adolescents, not to mention Winona Ryder's hysterical overacting and an unhealthy reliance on jump cuts in the middle of suspenseful scenes - a bit like running up behind someone and shouting 'BOO!' - as a means of scaring the viewer.Overall I found myself checking which episode I was on and looking at my watch wondering how long it would be before we got to something meaningful and, eventually, how much more of I was going to have to endure before I could switch to my next bingefest.Seems, from the average review score, to have scored a hit with most viewers so by all means give it a go. Maybe I'm just getting too old."
1480,"The 1 st episode itself gives the hint that this series is not ganna be like other series this is full of mystery that hides behind the dark parallel world .
The best character that I found was eleven or ell she have some special powers and after the use of these power she feels weak and blood comes out of his nose.
In short-
a nostalgia-heavy love letter to the 80s set in a suburban small town where secret scientific experiments into the paranormal and supernatural, at times with human subjects, starts to wreak havoc on the normal lives of its residents."
1481,Wonderful 80s feeling and a really good plot. I liked first season for that mixed atmosphere of The Goonies and x-files and the nice idea of alternate universe. Also season two was good even if a little boring in some parts but overall a good season. The third season....not so good. I am at ep 3 or 4 and I keep watching it because I invested a lot of time in the first two seasons but how the things are developing....
1482,The more you watch the better it gets!! On season 2 so far. 80s Nostalgia for sure! Great story and good acting by all. Look forward to watching more
1483,I watched the all seasons and all seasons are super actors done thair job perfectly everyone performance is grest and engaging and answer to the never ending story in seson 3 that scene is sing song serious situation best entertaining series
1484,"I'm giving 5 stars to the actors and the main characters. for police and army and goverment no stars cuz less war more child act, looks like the army and goverment are useless. i hope next season's with more budget's make this movie OPEN WORLD WAR , the virus spread all over the world those kids meet each other again to fight the final war againts the stranger things, because since season 1 till today i smell this movie has abit RESIDENT EVIL theme and SILENT HILL theme. Give the kids more guns like MAD MAX movie , more chaos situation with the world and area , more wars and dark gore scene. but for season 4 the kids all already teenagers and the teenagers already adult. Make more abit hardcore and hardgore. Trust me this title has big potential. Make it based on what peoples like , and make what modern movies didnt do yet, you will get more profits. We almost reach 2020. We need more movies open world dark war chaos mystery aliens space apocalypse world end ritual religious and more types of classic mix modern dark evil scenario scene. any of this have , movie will be in complete set."
1485,"It's about a gang of school boys who help a mysterious girl in a search of a missing friend of theirs. What I found about this was the drama was interesting and it reminded of a PS3 drama game ""Heavy Rain"" as it was motive or motivating for the character's story."
1486,"The first 2 seasons weren't much fun, but season 3 is a mess. Bad acting, stale dialogue and a shallow story, that should easily fit into a 80ties cartridge for the Nintendo Entertainment System.
What I really dislike about Stranger Things is the fake 80ties nostalgia, which absolutely fails to create any convincing reality: every color is super bright, everything is super clean and freshly washed, like there haven't been dust and dirt in this decade. The car seem to wash themselves while being used.
ST reproduces some kind of Meta-80ties, focusing only on Mainstream Mass Culture and ignoring the fact, that there has been many highly diverse subcultures.
And why doesn't any kid have a computer? I grew up in Germany, I got my first in 79 and during the 80ties nearly all the boys in my area owned a Commodore, Atari or Sinclair.If you want a more realistic show about the 80tie, go and watch ""Halt and Catch Fire""."
1487,Best Web Series I Have Ever Seen. I Want 10 more Seasons like this.
1488,"The kids are amazing. You won't believe that its all an acting. I finished the first season all in one day. And that actually tells you how exciting is this show. Highly recommended, especially if you don't have anything to do (;"
1489,"How can I put this.... oh yeah this show is the show of the century, this show has 80s references, humour, darkness and emotion, HELL I CAN'T WAIT FOR Stranger Things 3 to come, I can;t wait to see what goes down in Starcourt in July, also the 1st and 2nd seasons don't disappoint, if you haven't watched this, please watch this, the Duffer Bros made the most original thing ever."
1490,"After watching season 2, I find out more emotional drama, which is excellent. E08 when they try to wake up Will from Demogorgon's control, Joyce, Jonathan and Mike take turns of warm memories are touching. The father-daughter affection between Hopper and El is one of the highlights of this season. Hopper disciplines and protects El in a way she can not accept and El firmly believe that : Friends don't lie. E07 El find her mother and sister. This part gives me a sense of X-Men. In the end, Hopper make a great apology to El, and we can feel his attention and love for her. This conversation is a textbook for parents to apologize to their children. To be honest, I don't really like Steve very much in the first season. But in this season, Steve acts just like a babysitter, his interaction with Dustin is also very interesting. I just want to say: Steve, you deserves better!About Nancy... Well, I can only remember the angelic side of her dancing with Dustin.E09 Mike and El finally meet!! I'm so excited! The most beautiful scene in the world is when people in love can finally be able to meet each other like the autumn wind integrate into autumn dewdrop. The last song Every breath you take is just so beautiful! This is love! I can loop through the last clip 100 times! Looking forward to the next season."
1491,"All the actors' performances are online, especially Will's mother, who could not find her little boy exudes the most of out of control and crushing feelings. It is worth mentioning that the children are cute and smart. The whole drama looks very comfortable and is full of 80's feelings like the fear of the Cold War, paranormal, Star Wars, Twin Peaks, DND and so on. Even if you remove these elements of the 80's, what remains is the pure warm town story about pure humanity."
1492,"Now, I was wondering why this show had such hype to it. I mean this show isn't bad, it's not. However, the formula is unoriginal, and looks shockingly similar to IT. How?
1. A group of kids that are unpopular
2. The adults seem not to realize anything is going on 
3. Stuff is happening in a small townIf this took place in Maine, than the resemblance would be uncanny."
1493,"STRANGER THINGS- 97%
Stranger things season 2 was a binge watch for me with phenomenal story structure, astonishing performances, and memorable 80's references. 
The duffer brothers did it again!
Story wise and execution: 32.8/35
Acting: 25/25
camer work: 19.1/20
sound: 20/20"
1494,"What started great in S1 leaves me irritaed in S2. Did they change the writers? Did they change the directors? What happened?Example: Eleven has never been outside of the town ever. She can barely talk properly. But all it needs for her is to take a look at the photo and *boom* she's sitting in a night-bus to Illionis to find her ""sister"". How did she recognize Illinois if she's never been there at all? Really? At least try ...Now we get to watch almost completely storyline-disconnected 2 episodes of Eleven and her sister, which after 2 episodes dissapear and did not contribute anything at all to the story.The whole S2 feels like they decided to develop the characters a bit more after the finished filming. They cut two or three episodes out and simply put some new in. Almost nothing happens in E1-E5. Should have stayed that way and keep more mystery. But no, after E6 they decide to go full Michael Bay ...After E6 I just wanted to end the torture, finish the series and forget about it. It's a shame what happend to a good series."
1495,"This s an interesting and creepy show. It does borrow from a lot of the science fiction genre, but that's okay. It has some really interesting characters. Gotta keep watching."
1496,The show Stranger Things is absolutely a masterpiece.
1497,"I was first aware of ""Stranger Things"" after the buzz surrounding the clip of the kids reacting to the Golden Globe nominations in 2016, it was a cute moment that (retrospectively) captured the charm of the show. Then there was David Harbour's speech at the SAG ceremony with Winona Ryder (still in character?) making the weirdest faces. Winning the ensemble award was a signal confirmed by the show progressively becoming the phenomenon of the year before being temporarily dethroned by Netflix' other youth-oriented but more socially-loaded ""13 Reasons Why"". Still, despite all these encouragements to curiosity, if it was up to me, I'm not sure I would have watched the series. I'm not the series' buff.
 But my wife is... and I registered to Netflix, her attention span is a better match for the series' format and thankfully, I never had to complain about her choices. And yesterday, we had just finished our nine-hours of ""Stranger"" binge-watching, over a span of ten days. And well, the show is good, quite good, Actually, it's ""2010's"" good and ""1980's"" good. You can't ignore the 80's thing, the series surfs across all the canvas of its flashy Pop Culture but with such a gusto and brilliance you could really believe this is a 80's classic. The only thing that slightly betrays the series is how the kaleidoscope of 80's is so persistent at times you can't dodge the feeling of a certain self-awareness from the authors, the Duffer brothers, there are at times an 'overuse' of reminders that we're not in the 2010's, but I guess this isn't an artistic license, it is a necessity.In fact, it's just as if the Duffer brothers didn't draw their inspiration upon the well of the decade nostalgia, the series would've been another soul-less rip-off of ""Lost"" or ""American Horror Story"". And let's not forget that the show wouldn't have worked the same if the kids had cell-phones or behaved like today's generation Z. Maybe there's a generational commentary after all, reminding me of Marge Simpson's question ""do kids still go on bike rides?"" a time where dungeons and dragons were played with cards, where a kid wanted to be a Ghostbuster and not having the most likes on Facebook. 
Netflix came up with two shows that said a lot about how kids have changed in three decades, but ""Stranger Things"" doesn't go for social relevance, not directly anyway, the real deal is within the story and never ceases to amaze you by the level of creativity and inventiveness injected into each episode. Sure, there are many archetypes that don't just belong to the 80's, you have the mysterious girl, a chosen one with hidden powers, you have the supernatural occurrences for starters, a group of kids with various personalities. But just when you're thinking ""oh, I've seen that before"", there's a new twist popping out on the screen or something that either thickens the plots or deepens the relationships, stuff which, while looking vaguely familiar, feels weirdly new and fresh with that 2010's/1980's feeling?
 Take the group of kids, you have the straight one (Finn Wolfhard), the goofy one (Gaten Matarazzo), the seemingly token black kid (Caleb McLaughlin) but there's never a moment where you feel they're here to play archetypes. The presence of Sean Astin reminded me that even in ""The Goonies"", you could feel the Spielbergian over-the-top touch, too many gadgets, too much cockiness, these kids in ""Stranger Kids"" feel closer to a certain reality, we would believe kids would act that way in the 80's, just like we would believe in the everyday and homely realism of the folks leaving in the neighborhood. For such a fantasy and sci-fi driven series, to feel that real is quite an achievement, but the soul of its success relied on one hit-or-miss character: Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. You see, I've never been a fan of all these girl power tropes, but Brown plays such a nuanced character that she practically defines the perfect sense of balance in the Duffer brothers' vision, at times, she's bad ass, other times, vulnerable but never in a ""Hit Girl"" way. You really feel for her and the chemistry with every other character makes the whole thing work. 
""Lost"" was a bit like that before it drowned itself in a maze of intricacies. I wish ""Strangers Things"" will keep on this trajectory, after two seasons and so many thrills, I wish it won't just get too wrapped up in its obsession to duplicate every element of the 80's. And while served by a good cast of known faces like Wynona Ryder, Harbour and Astin, the series is a vehicle for great emerging talents and I guess I wouldn't be wrong in assuming that Brown will be Oscar nominated before reaching her 20's. She's that good. 
So ""Stranger Things"" is the typical case of a new and original recipe made of traditional ingredients, it's a salad of familiar elements, but it's digestible, and at times delicious... and it makes you realize how fast time flies, remember in the 80's, there was a wave of nostalgia over the 60's (""Dirty Dancing"", ""Stand By Me""...) when baby boomers were looking at the good old times. Imagine that in ""Stranger Things"", the oldest main actors were born in the 70's and now we're looking at the 80's as the good old days, and watching the show, I remembered the TV of my childhood. Even the theme has that ominous V-like tempo and the series that crappy VHS look. Still, the special effects that had the wisdom not to be too 80's. Again, that sense of balance... the Duffer brothers know how to play it like in the 80's, and when not to... and the mark of the best directors is to make the strangest things out of familiar elements. And the best."
1498,"Since its debut last year, Netflix's ""Stranger Things"" has become a popular show. I just binge-watched the first season. A couple of things struck me. One is of course the focus on government secrets and how Will's disappearance leads to the realization that this small, idealistic town might not be what it seems. Equally significant is the look at and allusions to 1980s popular culture.* But beyond that, there's the contrast between Will's family and Mike's family. Mike comes from an affluent family in an immaculate house, while Will comes from a working-class family in a house not in the best condition. These set the stage for the eerie events soon to dominate the town.From the first episode, it was clear that this was going to be a good show, and it didn't disappoint. Winona Ryder, as Will's distraught mother, puts on what has to be the best performance of her career. If you only know her from her ""cute"" roles, then you're in for a pleasant surprise. Outstanding series.And remember, the bad men are coming.*I understand that the show's creators tracked down the makers of the era's board games to find out what they got called in foreign languages, so as to be able to properly localize the show in foreign countries."
1499,"I recently saw ""Stranger Things"" and was really pleased with the TV series. This series has two seasons and I watched them both in almost four days, because it was so interesting to watch and I could not stop. It is a drama, fantasy, horror kind of series that shows how strong a relationship between friends can be.This movie is filled with amazing actors who truly make the film. First, Millie Bobby Brown, as the female lead, known as a girl called eleven gives a legendary performance in this show and acts really credibly despite being so young. Second, Finn Wolfhard, known as a young boy Mike is very passionate about his friend and truly lives into every scene. The casting for this movie is truly perfect, and the actors do not disappoint.The series is about a girl named eleven, who is being raised in a lab. She can move things and attack others with her brain. As the story unfolds, there is an alternative universe called the Upside Down, where a monster lives. The monster kidnaps a middle schooler called Will. The plot revolves around Eleven escaping the lab and starting to work on a plan to save Will with her new friends. The show is thrilling and kind of frightening for its jump scares.Thanks to the amazing Duffer brothers, who are the creators of the series, it is almost impossible not to like the fascinating and powerful story line. It is filmed in a small town in the USA. Production values are also quite good with some beautiful cinematography, editing, lighting and sound so the series was definitely made with a big-budget.Finally, I love how in this film just when everything seems to finally be going right, it can turn around in an instant. This series has the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, and scares to keep you wanting for more! The ending is fairly well wrapped up with a few loose story threads left hanging, with a promise for potential follow on seasons, which I can't wait for."
1500,"The following is a reflection of Stranger Things 2 from a fan's perspective. It is full of spoilers so only read if you are a fan looking for another opinion on the show.For fans like myself of Stranger Things Series 1 (ST1), it represented more than just a TV show. ST1 celebrated those that prefer chess club/D&D to rugby/baseball or Phoenix Arcade Game to Drama club. In the world of ST1, it was the nerds who saved the day, not the cool kids. The Duffer Brothers (TDB) including references in the series to Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter films, Jaws and Arcade games was just heaven for me. Tangerine Dream then returning the favour by remixing the ST theme for their Particles album made it even more special.Given all this, it's really disappointing to have to write a negative review for Stranger Things 2 (ST2). The fundamental issue for TDB is that with the runaway success of ST1 is that they have inadvertently created their own monster in the basement. ST2 suffers the same problems as other sequels of successful films/series; bigger budgets delivering lesser outcomes, new characters adding nothing, current characters not developing any further and hitherto unknown actors now performing in their current guise as established TV stars. Examples? In ST2, the creepy top secret scientific military research establishment is now essentially a tourist attraction where anyone can visit to know what is going on and even take a tour of the labyrinth. The sinister main scientist brilliantly played by Matthew Modine in ST1 is now replaced by a cuddly local doctor figure whose point of being in the show I am still not sure of. It's like Jaws 2 replacing the original giant shark with Flipper the Dolphin.Other new ideas simply do not work. The new characters half brother/sister bring nothing and in the case of Max is a big disappointment as it could have been a great opportunity to have another kid with some kind of extra sensory powers. Instead she is a love interest and a weak one at that. Bob is also introduced and we enjoy watching his character develop until he is then deemed expendable. The breakaway episode with Eleven just looks like an extended Duran Duran Wild Boys video with really poor acting. The dynamic between the kids is also less convincing this time and the decision to only have Mike and Eleven come together in the last episode was a big mistake as their interplay was one of the central success features of ST1. The kids are now stars and this seems to show in their performances (except Finn Wolfhard). Strangely the actor playing Will, Noah Schnapp, who never seems to be on the celebrity circuit with the others, actually delivers the strongest performance of all the kids. The adult performances are not much better and Winona Ryder in full distressed mode now just comes across as hammy and over the top.The Snow Ball ending felt self-indulgent, almost as if TDB were trying to re-write their own Snow Balls but this time they get the girl. I don't blame them as there are 1980s 6th Form Discos I would happily re-write the ending to.I sincerely hope that as I write this that TDB are revisiting all the successful elements of ST1 as they develop Stranger Things 3 (ST3). The monster they have created is growing larger and larger and if changes are not made in ST3, taking on board the lessons of ST2, then my biggest fear is that the season finale of ST3 could well be TDB getting eaten by the monster."
1501,"Okay, let me start this off by saying that Stranger Things is one of the best TV shows that I have ever watched on Netflix, and maybe one of the best shows that I will ever watch. From the outstanding visuals to the underrated acting of 5 13-16-year-old actors, this show puts a nostalgia touch on the 80's and memorizes the past. From it, viewers have seen a bad ass female character known as Eleven taken on by 13-year-old Millie Bobby Brown get put to life in an action-packed ride with the help of four friends on their way to look for their missing friend Will (Noah Schnapp), viewers can laugh and cry continuously as the plot just thickens within each episode. With every show comes a soundtrack and it is like if you have never lived in the 80's it's like you were just reborn into that time period. The background music features a long list of legendary 80's artists bringing you back to the time of rock era. Not to leave out the amazing acting of actress Winona Ryder and David Harbour. Seriously if you haven't seen this show on Netflix, you really have to. There's nothing else except that it is iconic."
1502,Stranger things is the best. Especially when.... I'm just kidding around with you. But seriously you have to watch it. If your a tech geek and love IPhones and the Samsung galaxy than this isn't for you. Its a movie based around the 80s where they didn't have a Samsung Oled TV. It is still cool and everything sounds like its based around a true story.
1503,"1 Season: Stranger Things is a series that appears a little unnoticed and out of nowhere has won a legion of fans, being a series with several references to the classic films of the 80s made many people fall in love, the series surprised me a lot, it has only 8 episodes and passes very fast they, in 1 day already to marathon the whole series, the cast was very well chosen, the narrative has some problems and sometimes tries to reference too much, is a series technically very well made, the references are cool, even though I think that sometimes they pass the point, and the final episode is for me the best of the series, closed very well the first season and made room for a continuation that will reach this month October, Stranger Things can be fun , mysterious and also a homage to the 80's, The Goonies for example is a great source of inspiration for Stranger Things, it's worth a lot, I hope the second season has the same quality or that it is better coming . Note 85"
1504,"I kept getting told to watch this show but didn't finally give in until February 2017 after seeing the Super Bowl ad for 'Stranger Things 2'. I watched 'The Twilight Zone', 'Star Trek' (Original), 'The X-Files' and a host of other shows but this is among the best shows I've ever seen. The entire cast is phenomenal and displays a great balance of adult life, teenage life and childhood. They do a great job with the kids especially, making them feel like the kids we all grew up watching in 'E.T.' and 'The Goonies'. The story is second to none. I watched the entire first season in 3 days, watching the final 4 episodes on the 3rd day. The entire plot centers around the mysterious disappearance of Will Byers. A boy who ultimately won't be found within the confines of our reality. Then a girl classified as '011' becomes known as Eleven or El after she joins the group of boys looking for Will. Winona Ryder is particularly impressive. Anyone who remembers her movies like 'Lucas', 'Beetlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Girl Interrupted' may confidently say this is her greatest work. I was never a big fan or her not did I ever dislike her, but she impressed me in this series. Winona's acting is unbelievable and her dedication to the story is outstanding. David Harbour's Jim Hopper is perhaps the most intriguing character. He varies from lazy and uncaring, to a dedicated investigator, to going far beyond the call of duty to making puzzling deals. We then have the saga of teenagers with Nancy, her boyfriend to be Steve, Nancy's friend Barb and Will's older brother Jonathan who is searching for his brother. Nancy is really in a tough situation throughout the series, caught up in a love triangle, battling her mother for her own independence and attempting to solve the disappearance of her missing and presumably dead best friend Barb. This situation draws Nancy and Jonathan together.The most rewarding part of the series is when the groups of characters finally all come together and share the information they've individually discovered."
1505,"What especially impressed me was the uniformly excellent acting of the children - really very impressive. I always think ""tone"" is one of the most important qualities a movie needs to possess - it needs to be coherent, well-thought out & consistent. ""Stranger Things"" has a very particular tone - the '80's feel, the homage to horror/sci fi/fantasy traditions - that is perfectly realized. It manages to be referential & ""cliched"" while still seeming fresh & original - a very clever trick. Congratulations to the Duffer Brothers!"
1506,Going through and reading the reviews for the show to those who hate it based on the fact that its not like any of today's shows ... you obviously missed the point it isn't suppose to be like today's shows its a show that is very nostalgic and takes you on a journey to what so many like myself in the 80s enjoyed ... no we didn't have the cgi special effects as what you are use to seeing today but the whole idea of a group of young friends having a wild adventure with a mix of mystery a bit of suspense and some corny fun is what makes 80s movies awesome and this nostalgic look back at that time is beautiful and well done.. what makes it so much more enjoyable is the music I am a huge fan to synth-pop/synth-wave/new-wave and 80s rock and pop ... so maybe you don't like the whole nostalgic pre-cgi corny cliché ridden tale but its Entertainment not meant to be taken seriously and that is what makes it fun ... too many of today's shows is too dry and lacks that fun element ... this is a break from all that actually its nice to just see a show that isn't pushing an agenda.
1507,"With Stranger Things Netflix had a big impact on me this year. I a very small time i become addicted to it. In the beginning I was not sure if this movie will win my attention, so I give her a chance that I don't regret. It certainly was the atmosphere that gets darker and darker around the series, the good technical implementation, as well as the acting that made me watching one episode after the other. The Story fells like its playing in 1983. Some of the movie-elements stick in the style of this time, which is creating a lot of charm and its used on purpose to create a specific mood.The first episodes creating the depth of the different characters. After this the series generate a need to keep watching the other episodes.For me Stranger Things is a mixture of the movies ""The Mist"" (2007), ""ET"" (1982) and ""Cloverfield"" (2008). I cannot describe the feeling why I select Cloverfield. Maybe it's the way this series feels. Cloverfield produced the same oppressive feeling in me.Technically Stranger Things has been developed on a very current state of the art. They surprised me with more complex computer-generated effects, as well as environments and objects. Light is used consciously to transfer mood and tension. I liked very much how the creators of the series could tie me up with this mood."
1508,"I'm not really into horror and I postponed watching this when I learned that it was set in the 80's, as I like modern series and films. But this is more mystery/thriller than scary and the whole 80s scene actually worked in its favour.I don't want to give anything away, as I believe that the less you know about a TV show or movie, especially a thriller, the more you'll enjoy it. I'll just add that there are children, teenagers, adults (thankfully) and their paths all interconnect to create a gripping story, with a mix of drama, suspense and even some humour. I was quite surprised to see that many episodes were written by different people, as they all pick up where the previous one left off. This is one series that it's easy to binge watch, I couldn't wait to see what would come next.Of course this isn't for everyone. It's sort of sci-fi but there is more fiction than science. But if it's entertainment you're after, this delivers."
1509,"It is great, but still a bit overrated. I think its rating is based less on its quality and more on nostalgia for the '80s that it brings. It pulls many elements from legendary shows and movies from the '80s and it's an obvious homage to Stephen King and movies like ""E.T."", ""It"", ""Golden Child"", ""Lost Boys"", etc. I'm not thrilled, but I am very satisfied. I enjoyed it and I'm very eager for the next season.8/10"
1510,"A story about childhood and kids. About friendship and love. In this respect, this movie harks back to a better tradition. Before the blood and gore video games of today.Strong performances by the adults. Amazing performances by the kids. On the negative side, plot is an amalgamation of Carrie, Firestarter and bump-in-the-night. Runs out of suspense about half way when it turns into an action movie. The ending felt a little unsatisfactory.Less melodrama and more perspective, please.Still, the actors carry the series most of the way. Hope that the second season has enough gas left in the tank."
1511,"This show brings the audience to the 80's realm and as a 90's kid, this totally blew me off. The old school American ambiance is so ethereally relaxing. It's like watching The Bridges of Madison County minus the adult romance. The radio, the country slash town life, the costume, everything was perfect. If you're into this kind of classic stuff, I'm sure you'll be definitely loving this series!The characters'acting and emotions deserve everyone's respect and praise. I couldn't find any character more fitting to their designated roles (except Nancy and Jonathan perhaps *forgive my bias but they could hell do a lot better on the next season*). Millie Bobby Brown (El), Winona Ryder (Joyce) and Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) are my favorites. El's iconic stare, smile and speech really caught my heart and got me utterly flabbergasted. Joyce's weary and frantic beautiful eyes did its job damn so well. This show really showcased each and everyone's experience and potential in acting. Almost all characters got the ""charm"" the audience unconsciously desire so bad. One best example is Dustin's character, who's supposedly the real science nerd and mediator of the group. This boy's got the bomb for real. What I'm looking for the next season is perhaps they could highlight Lucas' and Mike's character to redeem themselves from their role (though I can honestly say they did their job pretty well).Story-wise, the pacing was medium-fast. Few to almost zero loopholes. This show for me doesn't belong to horror genre but more on the family/mystery/adventure corner which I think could be watchable to kids 10 and up. The eerie art, grimly colorful lights, and the classic 80's music complemented each sequence harmoniously. All I could ever say is that this show has got it all! The thrill, hype, romance, camaraderie vibe, subtle contempt, everything is here folks! Just watch and you'll never regret a minute of your life! I can't wait for the next season!!!"
1512,"Upon hearing about the new show Stranger Things, I was at first a little skeptic. So many shows and movies have done the topic, and it was kinda just another one that would come and go with no real fan base as far as I thought. Watching episode one I was clearly mistaken. the episode was well done, the characters I immediately fell in love with, and the episode ended with a cliffhanger. I thought Walking Dead was gripping. As you join on the quest to find Will Byers, you will feel nostalgia, and a longing for that time in the 80s that a lot of viewers actually haven't lived (myself included. A fan of the 80s all the way, but born in the 90s). References to pop culture aren't overdone, the music is just amazing and makes you feel like you're in the decade, and the small details are even fine tuned to make you think for the duration of the episode you were in the 80s while watching it. The story is so good that immediately after the first season, I and my friends began to talk about what could be happening next, the wait for season two will be long and arduous, but totally worth it for this gripping show."
1513,"The show centres around a group of nerdy misfit twelve year-old boys. The brothers who created, wrote and directed this were twelve in 1996 and that's very telling, the nostalgia isn't for the 1980s but for mainstream family films of the 1980s as seen from a distance and not as lived.There is nothing real or authentic or original to be found here, it's a film-kit made up of references, plot lines and characters cobbled together from various Spielberg films as written and filmed by inexperienced film-makers - everything is obvious, on-the-nose, and lacking in depth."
1514,"I'm an AMC- Walking Dead fan. Which I feel is one of the most innovated ""zombie"" / apocalyptic concepts ever! However, after a binge viewing of ""Stranger Things"", I would now watch stranger things over the Walking Dead. I love the 80's setting, attire, and couple of those ""Star Wars"" references. Its also reminiscences of the old Steven King series"" Amazing Stories"".This series is captivating. But you must know if you it has great cliff hangers and once you start you'll stay up all night with watching the ""next"" episode."
1515,"Well, I don't think I wasted my time when I decided to watch this show. It was interesting, it was good and it brought something new. But to be honest, I saw the other comments about it before watching and now I can say it is not THAT good. Sometimes it is slow, sometimes it is not logical, sometimes it is just another Teen Show and there are many clichés. It was a good entertainment but it was not a surprising show, it didn't make me anxious for the finale and for the result as some other series did. It was possible to predict many things that happened, so I was rarely surprised by the way the plot went. So, you can watch it, but don't expect a 9,1 TV Show (The rate this moment)."
1516,"A homage to every 80s movie you could possibly think of, Stranger Things nevertheless stands up as an enjoyable and satisfying piece of work in its own right.Most of the characters in the show are interesting and well-acted. Central to the story is a group of somewhat nerdy young friends, who behave and interact like real kids. It's absolutely delightful watching them navigating their way through the bizarre story.The episodes are shot extremely well, and the directors keep an excellent grip on the tone throughout, which manages to intermingle tension, creepiness and light-heartedness seamlessly.However, this show has received somewhat over-exuberant praise. The show does not simply nod towards previous horror/sci-fi works - it actively recycles elements to such an extent that very little here can be claimed as original. Furthermore (without wishing to spoil the plot), the mystery which is revealed to underpin the plot is somewhat shallow. The 'bad guys', such as they are, are neither nuanced or fleshed-out and the viewers are left with absolutely no interest in them. Although the show successfully reaches a satisfying narrative conclusion within its eight episodes, ultimately there's nothing very complex here.This is well-made sci-fi/horror which is absolutely delightful and charming to watch, whilst also being creepy, tense and gripping. It can be appreciated by people without any interest in the 80s nostalgia indulgence with which the show is associated (most of all, it reminded me of the more recent series Fringe). Lovers of good film and TV will enjoy watching this, but a 'masterpiece' it is not."
1517,"I just saw Stranger Things and I liked it. Stranger Things is a new Netflix mini-series set in the early 1980s. The first season deals with the mysterious disappearance of a little boy named Will, a sinister government organization and a little girl with psychic powers.It's good to see Winona Ryder in something big again. I know she has been in other things but I haven't paid much attention since Girl Interrupted. That was the last Winona Ryder movie I can recall watching.It truly felt like something from the 1980s, from the music to the sets. It also had the right ambiance- that particular style of Gothic atmosphere that recent horror has lost. It felt like a 1980s science fiction / horror / fantasy with a bit of mystery. Unlike American Horror Story it did not rely heavily on gore or sex. You could have convinced me it was made in the 1980s.Since Stranger Things was so successful I hope other horror and scifi projects imitate it. I often hate when something popular is leeched but this is a style of film making I had missed.Noticeable Homages and references: Stand by Me / The Body, Firestarter, Carrie, The Shining, Stephen King's It, Sometimes They Come back, Poltergeist, The Thing, H. P. Lovecraft, Star Wars, E.T: the Extraterrestrial, Dungeons and Dragons, The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Evil Dead, The Twilight Zone (two episodes: The Monsters are due on Maple Street and Little Girl Lost), Nightmare on Elm Street, Watcher in the Woods, and even Let the Right One In (The girl going by the name El (short for Eleven) and how The Bullies were handled).The one thing that I felt made Stranger Things shine above American Horror Story is that Stranger Things is not excessively sexual or gory. It has just enough gore where the gruesome scenes do horrify you and stick with you but there is also a subtlety so that your imagination can take over and you do not become desensitized to things. You actually form an emotional connection to the characters and care what will happen to them. There's also enough mystery left to make you hungry for more and for your imagination to run wild about certain details.I liked it a lot. My one complaint has to do with the flicker light effect in the very first scene and later in high abundance in the final episode. I do NOT recommend anyone with Epilepsy watching Stranger Things, at least not the first scene of the first episode or large parts of the season finale. I'm somewhat photosensitive myself (though I don't have seizures from it) and I was bothered by the constant flashing in the final episode, I say this as someone who does NOT have epilepsy, I know it would be far worse for those of you that do have the condition. The first scene was bearable though it was a relief when it was over with but the final episode's flickering lights was dragged on and on and on. They also had unnecessary jump scares and some wall ghost CGI that unfortunately reminded me that yes, this was recently made (and would have looked better entirely done with practical effects). But otherwise I loved it.I recommend Stranger Things to anyone who likes 1980s horror, scifi or fantasy. If you miss traditional horror in a semi-modern setting this is the show for you. I personally would have preferred more supernatural / fantasy elements as opposed to the X-Files-esque pure Science fiction but I found it likable. There are lot of classic tropes and clichés that some of us adore. And some of the tropes are turned on their head- like expecting the one character to end up with the girlfriend of the bully, or that bully showing he actually has depth and can grow as a person. That one, in particular, was a wonderful and welcome twist on the 1980s film stereotype. I liked Stranger Things and I hope it's second season is equally enjoyable."
1518,"If you enjoy horror and thriller staff, this one is what you are looking for. Despite the fact that I didn't fall in love with the story, I liked the atmosphere a lot and it simply drags us back to the old times- you know, no smartphones, no internet etc. Everything you focus is the people themselves and how they act.*** SPOILER ALERT *** I mean you can create a story that is related to the parallel universes and physics, yet this sort of faceless monsters simply ruin the shows. Even if that is for the 'horror' and the 'mystery' part, something more humanoid would make the series more realistic, therefore scarier."
1519,"Wow.I wasn't convinced when I started this series - it seemed good, but I typically abandon TV shows half-watched, and my hopes were low. This one, though, I finished in a day.The characters are always a selling point for me, and these guys stole my heart. Couple that with the bust of nostalgia (from the 80s tunes right down to Winona Ryder), a solid plot and plenty of action... well, you've got yourself a winner. I've heard it compared to movies like The Goonies or Stand By Me - which definitely works. I was hooked after the first two episodes - I'd recommend giving this one a watch."
1520,"Location, Location, Location. Well if you are going to create a replica of an 80's movie going experience why not shoot in the exact same location as Spielberg shot E.T.? Does any one notice David's House? The Shed? The Search? It's not an homage it's a dead shot location of E.T. and I was wondering why it was so familiar? Perhaps because I've seen it before? Check out shots in David's bedroom, the closet, the bunk beds, the search with the flashlight, it is the same location and lighting for E.T. It's a replica, and the clothes have the same effort. The kids vest and bikes and other details if you know ET. Well done. No harm no foul, just wondering why it was familiar beyond the 80's?"
1521,"I loved this show I can watch it over 1,000 times
Totally recomend watching this"
1522,"I couldn't finish S1E1, I am not going to waste one more minute with this lame third season. Adios!!!"
1523,"One of the bestest series drauma ever....
And Most iconic cast in this Era. Milliebobbybrown, she is amazing..,She deserved all awards for her acting,
And The Duffer brothers , Whoaaa...!Mindblowing story & Directing. I am waiting to see feature film of yours. Pls make it quick.."
1524,"I wont go over details cause many users has already done that. What I don't understand is not the way MIND FLAYER finds its way back, its why every season a man who has or had romantic relation with Joyce has to die ?
Once was ok , twice was huh, third was overdo!!!!"
1525,"When I was 5 years old, my mother always told me that Alexi was the key to life. When I went to school, they asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I wrote down 'Alexi'. They told me I didn't understand the assignment, and I told them they didn't understand life."
1526,"1) After a few episodes, it is clear that Winona Ryder way over-acts.2) This is a cross of many previous movies - The Goonies, Phantasm, Dreamcatcher - with some X-Files thrown in.3) When I think of the 80s, Vision Quest comes to mind. When I think of Vision Quest, I think of Louden Swain. And lo and behold... he shows up as the doctor/scientist. But, he looks really old. The white hair is terrible.4) The younger kids do a better job than the high school teenage kids. But, they talk to quick. Again, they over-act. Literally, one kid is beginning to say his lines at the exact Nano second that another kid finishes his lines. Too staccato for me. Very annoying.5) The level of production is like an after-school movie or weak Stephen King movie, like ""The Stand.""6) One thing that I did like was the 80s synthesizer music. That brought back good memories.7) After the forth episode, I just left it running while I worked on the computer. I've already paid for the Netflix subscription, so it was just background noise while I worked. I occasionally looked up, but I can tell you this... episodes 5 - 8 go downhill from 1 - 4."
1527,"This is my first review and I'd like to write since many people didn't make the obvious connection: Stranger Things ""borrows"" so many things from Resident Evil 0 and Silent Hill movie that it's borderline theft.The ""bad man"" is James Marcus from Resident Evil 0. He is a white haired, tailored suit man that every government has.Parallel dimension is nothing new but the way they treat it is directly borrowed from Silent Hill 4.The creature? It is the most obvious one: It is the Leech from Resident Evil 0. The Leech! Please make a Google Image Search and tell me they are different. I immediately got cold feet after seeing it because it's borderline theft.Best thing about Stranger Things is Winona Ryder. And her part has been ""borrowed"" too, from Silent Hill movie. Child got lost in a different dimension, she goes a bit out of her mental health but she has been always right and at the end she ""rescues"" her child. It is so... Let me put it this way: If Winona Ryder didn't act extraordinarily great, this show would be irredeemable.I'd also like to point out that Stranger Things had no impact on me. Not on horror-wise or plot- wise... I watched it and said ""meh"". As a ""meh"", it gets a 4/10 from me."
1528,First of all if you still haven't watched that show yet you must prepare your popcorn and prepare yourself for the best mystery sci-fi show ever forget all the shows you watched before I don't know about the future but this show will make it harder for any coming shows in the same category one last note if you can Binge it Binge it
1529,"I can't say enough great things about this show. The story is awesome, the cast is perfect, and the music!!!"
1530,Stranger Things keeps getting better every season. A rare trait in today's series'.
1531,"I watched this after a few recommendations, and I can tell you I won't be passing on the recommendation. The characters lack depth, but I guess its hard to show that over a short series.The story line draws inspiration from many old movies, nothing fresh and exciting.The music is good, but a lot of times it felt like the wrong choice of tone, I often wondered why some scenes had music at all. I feel like giving this a 1, to try and off set the 9.3 rating a bit.. I've rarely ever left a review before, in fact this could be my first one, but after seeing the rating I felt compelled to. This is definitely not the best show of all time."
1532,"Mind Blowing, Awesome script, Awesome Set Up, Must watch. It's one of a kind of show, which anybody can like. Binge it on!!"
1533,"Fun, Fun and Fun... This one has so many things and character's they are handled wonderfully & grouping them all is an masterstroke, and the classic 80's movies everything from teen romantic comedy, mystery , spy thrillers,horror, psych and the fun whoa then there's more, truly a show to never miss,
My favourite is of the group of Dustin & hopper's it is full of comedic moments & for the movie buffs it's an treat
expecting another soon with even more things to come 😊😊👏👏"
1534,"Bravo what an amazing 3 season's of action packed , fun, loveble characters , cant wait for next season"
1535,We have watched Stranger Things since it first aired and love it! Every season gets better and better.
1536,"The first season's good, the second was alright, but the third is by far the best among them. Every episode felt like it would never end, in a good way."
1537,"Individually, season 1 was a solid 10, season 2 was a mediocre-at-best 7, and season 3 wrapped everything up perfectly to be another 10.Overall, as a trilogy, I'd give it a 10."
1538,"The third season is great then great then great, indescribable thing of beauty! And also the wonderful thing is that the improvement of the music level, if the serial continues to 10 seasons I do not mind. (best produced by Netflix)."
1539,"""9/10!"" the reviews state on IMDb and other news publicity sites. I like Science Fiction and lots of people have been talking about Stranger Things on netflix. It's a show that is influenced by 80's sci- fi and action movies. Everything about this is from the 80s. It's basically for nostalgia-philes. Friends recommended me this show because I like the X Files. I checked out the first episode. It seemed to have OK action scenes. The monster, whatever it was, seemed pretty cool, but you rarely see it. Most of the show is Drama. I got really annoyed at the actors very quickly (Except for the reluctant cop Jim Hopper played by David Harbour, whom I thought was quite funny) Winona Ryder (Will's mother) really irritates me. Her over acting is unnecessary. It's filled with cheesy 80s nostalgia and Hollywood B-Grade movie Clichés. I was expecting better, but I don't think i'd stick around for this one."
1540,"For several years I've researched various TV shows and movies to see if they're worth watching and for the most part I agree with the IMDb rating. Anything over a 9 is usually binge-worthy. Shows like The Sopranos, Breaking Bad, Dexter, Six Feet Under, etc live up to their ratings here but Stranger Things in the same category? I found it entertaining but the production, cinematography and sound track are just okay.I agree with those who have pointed out the similarities with ET, Poltergeist, Carrie. I watched the whole first season of Stranger Things and while it's better than most everything regular TV networks release these days I gotta say the rating is ""just a bit outside."""
1541,"I can't enjoy it. Not even season one.
Everything seems borrowed. The plot is based on reactions that are not realistic. There are more holes in this than in a Swiss cheese. I could go on and on but I'd just say there is no craft in it. So amateurish!"
1542,Really repetetive sorry if i missspell. The same happens i s1 s2 and s3 with almost No difference
1543,"It's Strange how the continuity & flow of 'Stranger Things' is a little 'upside down'.What I liked about Seasons 1 and 2, was the seriousness with which it delivered & entertained.1. The major players were not the usual handful of boring suspects collaborating together: - ie: astronauts, Dr's, FBI agents, forensic detectives, geniuses, PI's - (ie: Private Investigators), scientists, secret agents or spies etc. They didn't have high IQs or come from super rich backgrounds, but they weren't 'plebs' either - (ie: of the lower social classes). They weren't religious, part of 'the-in crowd' or 'the it group'. These were your average middle-class kids. With the exception of Holly & Erica, these were pre-teens & teens. Their adventures reminded me of 'The Railway Children'. Set in the 1980s, Stranger Things held my attention as I 'took a trip down memory lane'.2. The acting from all of the cast was so superb & superior to anything else I'd seen in the past, especially from Dustin, Eleven, Erica & Lucas. There were no 'stiffs'. Hopper's lakeside lodge, 'Coffee & Contemplation' approach to life is worlds away from my own, that the show captivated my imagination. I could daydream about future possibilities of such a lifestyle.3. The very mention of 'Nam' - (short for Vietnam) - by Lucas, and 'Project MK Ultra' by Eleven's aunt, is/was a reminder and an educational testimony to another one of America's blunders and 'horrible history'. It therefore validated the series as 'pukka'.4. The episodes weren't used as a sales pitch or platform to showcase US allies or advances, strategies or strides the US have made in science & technology.
However, by 'not' displaying the future of America, via its array of military help & weaponry that kills 'the monster spy', this is probably what accounts for 95% of the lack of funding & interest from serious investors. Hence why Season 3 was a little different, but ultimately, what we've ended up with is sporadic seasons & disjointed episodes.My Star Ratings:
Season One: 10/10; Season Two: 10/10; Season Three: 2/10 - for effort; Season Four: 0/10 ???"
1544,"Good, loved and perfect.... The end is magic and emotional. I love it !"
1545,It was like i was with them the whole time and very great acting it deserves more
1546,Hey that's pretty good. a show about character development and alternate dimensions. Season 3 just came out with episode 8 being the best of the show so far. dont watch season 2 episode 7 that's bad but I still give it a strong 10.
1547,It's one of the best and still the first two seasons but Netflix they just wanted to squeeze every $ the can get new seasons of thing they end perfectly
1548,"Season 1 and Season 2 blah blahWhy are there so many forced love scenes in this movie?It is Season 3, so we can't expect the same characters and the same mindset, because the main roles are mostly consist of youngsters(age 10-20). That's why the bone of this season wasn't that outrages(Love)(Hello! There are six teenagers in the show, of course there will be lot of love conflicts).The plot is weak and not worty to the original ""Stranger things""?Yes, this is the same monster and the story is kinda familiar with the season two(open the gate,beat the big monster and close the gate), but there are lot of refreshing things in this movie which most of the ""it is a garbage season"" people tend to forget. For example the Mall(it gave a whole new world to the show), the new characters(Robin is kinda cool, Lucas' little is sister is adorable and pointful), Russian plot(which was quite weak in this environment, but still it was exciting to watch). It's a comedy in its strange way, so there will be a few completely unrealistic scenes(Russian never touched Robin during the torturing, expect Eleven leg the main roles are either get killed or were never touched by any monster) . The scenes with the monster were actually quite unique(in the hospital and in the mail)(the monster was a new, because it had a body which was build by using people bodies and rats bodies(And it wasn't scary at all? Tell me more)).Some of the main roles died ... and new characters were born.(Keeping the plot exciting and Interesting), so in the end one summer really did change everything."
1549,"I have never seen a professional actor overact the way that Ryder does in this series. Beside the other actors, she looks like the amateur who does 'crazy' so badly that one thinks she has Parkinson's. The other actors reaction to her is of simple amazement that she has chosen the same trembling, entire body movement to express a simple sentence. No wonder she hasn't been in anything for years. People have finally had enough of her. Why they decided to drag her out of hiding to do this series is anyone's guess. The rest of the cast was OK. Some of the dialogue was pretty forced, but even the kids do a better job than Winona Ryder. She ruins the series."
1550,"Stranger Things is an excellent series, with a very good narrative and character."
1551,"For the the best Netflix series ever...
Once you start watching this then surely you fell in love with each and every Character"
1552,This series all characters very good and acting is awesome
1553,"I can not describe with words how amazing this series is (yes even the third season). I cannot recommend more that anyone who has Netflix watches this. And if you don't have Netflix, buy it and watch it. This is filled to the brim with exciting plots, awesome actors, and an epic intro sequence! I am dying to see a fourth season. But we have to wait until 2021 because of a little something in the air. I can't wait for this fourth season!"
1554,"I honestly don't know why there are so many negative reviews about season 3. This is the best season so far imo. Though it's not perfect, as I will get into, it gets so much darker and so much more interesting to watch.CONS:
-Lost some of its 80s vibe
-Mikes Character was totally different from his character in S1 and 2 at the beginning of the season. But then again, many things can change in one year.
-the singing at the end with was cringey... but I also feel it was meant to be cringey
-some CGI was off
-some lines were a little cringeyPROS
-everyone's acting, especially Billy, Hopper, and Eleven, was incredible
-it still feels like the 80s/90s
-Nancy and Eleven were totally badass
-the MUSIC
-super dark and has good jumpscares
Honestly the pros made me forget about the things that annoyed me. If you are somebody who's looking for a good show, don't let crazy movie critics let you change your mind about a movie/show. See for yourself and try to enjoy it.
P.S Duffer Bro... PLEASE DONT MAKE THIS INTO ANOTHER RIVERDALE!!!"
1555,"This season contains lot of joy,love, comedy also sadness which helps this series to increase its popularity.waiting for the next season"
1556,Season 1 was a very fresh story. Season 2 felt like it was just trying to one up season 2. But season 3 man that was the best of the 3. Season 3 was a real tear jerker.
1557,"I just finished watching season 3 and guys i really don't have words , i really don't know what to say , it was incredible and amazing . Honestly my favorite season !!"
1558,"The first season had its moments, even with the misrepresentation of D&D and the frequently long episodes. Season two never should have happened. Each episode is duller than the one before and the 80s nostalgia vibe has just gotten tired. The performances are fine, but none of the characters have really grown much. And since they weren't that interesting to begin with, this is a problem. Highly recommended if you're having trouble sleeping, though. This will knock you out."
1559,"One of best series of all time
Full of thrill
Goosebumps"
1560,But I just don't see the reasoning or value in using Jesus and God as a cuss word so often. It isn't necessary and crossed over to insulting and grotesque. So many other cuss words can be used but feels like the writers are purposely inserting JC and GD to tick people off or offend them.
1561,"Some people here clearly dont understand what this series is based on? Old horror/thriller movies and clearly third season took plot points from old ""commie"" hating american movies.
I liked the third season since I felt second one dragging too much. Now there was constant action after the second episode and felt like every single character had their own unique plot which was just outstanding.Overall: S1:9/10 S2:8/10 S3:9/10"
1562,"This season is everything I expected from this show. I wouldn't say it is perfect but It is a very compelling one, at least to me. I saw a lot of people complaining about this season being so predictable and there wasn't much intensity to the story. While I somewhat agree with the first point but the second point was patently absurd. You can't expect every show to be mind-bending and full of twist. It has its own thing and the characters that people really care about. They knowingly embrace the cheesiness and It works for the show.The stakes are raised even higher than the previous seasons. The first few episodes were a bit slow but we get more time with the characters and seeing them learning things about each other was a wonderful experience. Everything from the cinematography to the production design is top-notch. The CGI in this season, my goodness! It is incredible. Seems like they went all out this season. Some new characters were introduced. Some of them work well with the story some of them didn't add much. I particularly liked Robin and Alexei. All the kids did a great job with the acting. Eleven is by far my favorite character of this show. She once again proves that she's one of the best talents working today. Dustin is as lovable as always. Even though I missed him with the gang for the most part but I enjoyed Him and Steve doing stuff together. In this season everyone is separated into different groups and they are all engaged in things that are somehow connected to the main story. Each character had something to do. I thought it was great. I liked the friendship between Max and Eleven. Lucas was charming as always. I enjoyed Erica's sarcasm. Mike is irritating for some part but in the end he comes around. They could've done better with Will's character. It seems like he was in a vegetative state for the entire season. He didn't have much to do aside from sensing the Mind Flayer whenever he was nearby. As for Nancy and Jonathan, they didn't have much of character development as I hoped. Although Nancy has some cool action sequences. Joyce and Hopper's performance is fabulous.This show is extremely well directed. The last two episodes were nail-biting. I thought the pacing was much better than the last season. There was something constantly happening, so I never felt outright bored for once. I felt when each specific thing happened. Most of the choices they made with the characters worked for me. I thoroughly enjoyed this season. I'm really excited for what comes next."
1563,"The whole storyline and overall vibe of season 3 is just incredible. I mean, Erica, Dustin and the whole storyline around Hopper is just so well written. And boy what did I love the ""neverending"" song gimmick from Dustin. Best writing I ever saw in a show. Just incredible."
1564,"Once the final episode credits role on Season 3, keep watching. You may feel sick to your stomach after seeing it, I was. Remember you were warned."
1565,"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!! The Duffer Brothers did it again and never fail to please the fandom. The suspense each episode leaves you in gives you butterflies and makes you want to watch every episode in one day (which I did😏). The CGI is amazing and makes everything look super realistic. The acting is obviously outstanding as well. Each actor/actress was casted superbly and make you feel like they show is real and everything is happening right in front of you!! Millie Booby Brown, Noah Schnapp, Caleb McLaughlin, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard and Sadie Sink really gives you the vibe that you are in the room with them and experiencing their trauma along with them. Not to forget David Harbour, Winona Ryder, Natalia Dyer, Dacre Montgomery, Joe Kerry, Maya Hawke and Charlie Heaton. Every single cast member makes you feel like you are one of them and that you are in the room with them. The plot and setting of the series is absolutely phenomenal and I can't wiat to see what the Duffer Brothers come up with for Season 4."
1566,"i don't get it what do people see in this show? actors overacted, everybody wants to be the main character while the villain who should have been at the center of the story was at the edge of it. and whats the deal with the intro and the 80's thing? if you are really into old and stuff go watch the 80's movie but not star wars, or better live in a village or somewhere, people are really tasteless in music! you think it was original? let me correct you right there, there was nothing original. you don't believe me right? go watch ""Akira"" it is an Japanese animated movie released in 1988 you'll see how much original El is watch ""insidious"", ""E.T"" it's like the evil version of it and there are may more. netflix wasted 8 hours of my life. go watch these movies and watch the series again then you'll see how much original the series is!! after doing this do message me if you think i'm wrong"
1567,"*SPOILER ALERT* The overall story line was appealing. The acting ranged from GREAT on the part of Millie Brown and David Harbour, to YAWN on the part of Winona Ryder and Modine.The writers/producers did a great job of trying to make it look authentically 80's, which as WHY... (some asked this)there is so much cigarette smoking going on in it. Having lived through the 80's I can attest, pretty much everybody smoked.Where the story line takes a turn to the ridiculous is towards the end of Episode 5, when Nancy... a young teenage girl dressed in design jeans and clothes decides she will crawl into a dark, slimy, cramped tree trunk! Oh, and she does so AFTER abandoning the guy with a gun and her only other means of protection- a baseball bat! Sorry, NO SALE.Well, I've not finished the series yet, so I may be back to edit this; but for now this is my take on it."
1568,"I am totally disappointed. It was so hyped that a horror fan like me had to see it. I saw the first season today, I spent my whole Sunday watching this horrible none-exciting Netflix show. I am so disappointed with Netflix, that I will never, ever see another show created by Netflix. This was a complete waste of time. I cannot believe how this show has an 8.9 rating. I would rate it -(minus) if I could. You want to see something really interesting and exciting? Watch the American Horror story. P.s I am writing this review while watching an episode. This ""here"" my friends, IT'S A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME. TOTAL. WASTE. OF. TIME."
1569,Don't look for logic it's Stranger Things. Season 3 is as good as s1 and s2. Underrated. Big 10❤
1570,Absolutely the dumbest film ever made. The only that Brown does is stare at something.
1571,No more comments. Top series. Thx Netflix. We are waiting for s04.
1572,This show is honestly the most well made show I have ever seen. It is made by the brilliant Duffer Brothers and contains a cast full of brilliant actors and actresses. This show is a must see for everyone and you will not be disappointed! Season 1 is extremely well made and arguably the best season out of the three that are out as of now. Season 2 does a great way of backing up its success in the past season with another great season. Season 3 is my personal favourite as it contains great 1980's pop culture references and is a very fun and entertaining season. Bring on season 4!!!
1573,Stranger things again make a successful movie to watch. I really enjoyed it. It a must to watch..
1574,"Everything in this series was fantastic...the actors, the setting, the direction
The last scene was legendary , harbor letter made everyone cry!!!THANKS AGAIN NETFLIX"
1575,I love this show. I love the humor. I wish you didn't have these kids cussing so much and being so rude to adults. Why oh why did you do that ending? Certain ppl made that show.
1576,"I don't know why there's all this hate. Especially considering this season didn't need to be made at all. Yeah, we had to wait a little more but I still think this is the same quality as Season 1 and 2. Heck, this might actually be my favorite season yet!It had a good mystery, great new characters (Robin being my favorite), some nice action, and definitely had the horror elements i've been looking for from this show. It also had really spot on political commentary with the Mayor and malls destroying small businesses in America. It's also nice to see these characters get explored more rather than being trapped in cliches like other shows would do. I absolutely hated Steve in Season 1 (even after the fight with John) but now in this season he's probably my favorite character and him paired with Robin was probably the best thing this season.Only thing i still don't like about this show is that sometimes it feels like it rides on sheer nostalgia. Yeah, the 80s are cool and the aesthetics aren't comparable to any other decade, but all these references to pop culture in the show gets old sometimes (especially the Neverending Story scene). The comedy can also miss a fair amount, but I still laughed a good amount in this season.I loved these creatures in the way they become blobs and morph together. It made my skin crawl and I was glued to the TV just wondering what the monsters would do. I'm glad they definitely did more with their budget this time around because it was well worth it.The synth soundtrack in this season is also amazing and perfectly fit the scenes they were playing over. I almost want to get the OST for it.Some things I wish this season explored more is Will as a character and him embracing change more as he felt pushed off to the side most of the time. Also, how the heck does he sense something bad is gonna happen with the back of his neck? It's also unclear how Eleven lost her powers but they always have time to explain it next season.Overall, while this season still has some of the issues of the first and second (for me anyways) and even paces itself like the others, I still really enjoyed this one and I'd honestly say it's my favorite though i would need to watch the first one again.Good job, Duffer Brothers. I'm interested in a Season 4 now that I know even without a cliffhanger, there is more room for stories involving the gang and the upside down worth telling."
1577,"This is the greatest TV show in the world! S1 was amazing, enjoyable to watch, intriguing story and amazing characters! S2 is so much better than the first one, new cool characters, fun action and the cinematography, oh the cinematography is incredible in loads of scenes! Favourite cinematography part was when Hopper goes into the tunnels and the camera slowly goes upside down. Cool atmosphere in that scene! Watch this right nooowwww!!!!! I'd give this a recommendation of 13 years old. I cant wait for season 3!"
1578,"""Borgen"" 8.5? ""The Fall"" 8.3 ""Citizen Kane"" 8.4???????????????????????????????????????????????????? ""Goodfellas"" 8.7 ""E.T."" 7.9the power of social networking....""Stranger Things"" is barely a 5.5...Ryder is in possibly the worst come back performance that I have ever seen. She looks directly into the camera 50% of the time. soundtrack = hello... 80's not real clichélighting..holy sh#t high school play level...am i the only one noticing the lights blaring in every actors' eyes?I will admit that I am compelled to find out what this is all about in spite of the ludicrous plot and barely pro acting ...what is truly disconcerting is the reviews this is receiving....this show is barely pro...cliché after cliché after cliché..acting, directing, lighting, sets, soundtrack etc...oh yeah, watching now...Ryder is just pitiful...omg the editing is IMovie level..stills ... completely unbelievable in HD...I feel like I am looking at a car wreck waiting for the emergency services to arrive..."
1579,"The story was already slow and full of too much pre/mid pubescent angst and then in season 2 you make that stupid little idiot knowingly keep the alien creature. Then he protects it, all the while it's mutating.
Who does that, no matter what??
How stupidly the character is written, no one is that stupid to just come out of the last really bad alien experience then keep an unknown creature that becomes increasingly agressive and creates more problems and still protect it. Really lost my interest from there and I just watched all the rest of the seasons on fast forward, only slowing it to normal speed enough times toonly catch the story and punch line - actually of which there was none, it becomes quite aimless.
Need to change that 'simple things, amuse...' quote to 'stranger things, amuses simple minds'."
1580,The chemistry between Mike and El is awesome. The whole thing rocks
1581,"Watched this years ago and though it was for kids, don't even think I finished the first season. I've changed my review based on one thing. I'm now watching it with my 10 year old daughter and she loved it, first kind of thing she's seen like this. So if your going to watch it, watch it with someone younger. Hope this helps."
1582,"The first 2 seasons were absolutely incredible works of dark sci-fi/horror fiction. The third season literally threw those characters in with some ridiculous, unexplained character development, Additional characters and plot elements that just muddied the show up and made it a mere shell of what it originally was supposed to be. Season 3 was an absolute bust and the fact that Netflix is allowing this mess to continue for at least one more season is beyond me."
1583,"This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time, this is also one of those rare kinds of shows where it's one that I feel was just made for me as it just about has everything I want.I love the show is a period piece, the show has a bit of a two way effect, for people like myself that have lived in the 80's decade, it's a really big welcome piece of nostalgia as the film just has everything 80's to a tee.Just seeing this show really makes me feel like a kid again, living and being part of that decade once more. There is a really big sense of familiarity from the movies, certain technology they have like VHS's, Dungeon's and Dragons, but my absolute favorite thing is the Starcade video arcade with all of the classic video games I know and love like ""Dragon's Lair"", ""Dig Dug"", etc. Just seeing the characters playing in that video arcade makes me sorely miss them but also motivated me to play some of those classics again.You name any of the culture and relics of the 80's it's all there. For anyone that never lived in that decade, this show can be an educational history lesson for anyone interested in that decade.Setting the show in the 80's really works, from giving you the feel of seeing a movie from that decade as most of their film were really colorful and most involved ordinary people thrust into extraordinary circumstances. But also fit with the drama as the 80's decade was a time of a certain degree of chaos under all the brightness of the 80's but also great change and the rise of culture and counterculture.I really love the title sequence, from the big red-letter graphic design that look like the kind you would see from the horror novels from yesteryear. But also that theme music which is great it's one of my favorite theme songs of all time, it sound like the kind of music from a John Carpenter film which is cool as he's my favorite movie director and makes sense as his films were a big part of the 80's decade.The effects are great there is some CGI but mixed with some practical effects. Really love seeing those creatures from the upside down, they don't disappoint as the kind from H.P. Lovecraft tales, whom are all strange and messed up. Their the kind of creatures you must see to believe along with the upside-down world which is equally all kinds of messed up. But also, like how the psychic powers are handled, they really look and feel believable. The suspense is also great and can be a scary sometimes.Really love the story, it almost feels a bit like this could of easily of been a Pre Sequel story to ""The X-Files"" which is ironic I say as ""The X-Files"" had a couple of pre sequel comic stories from IDW on Mulder and Skully. Man, this could have made an awesome crossover seeing Mulder and Skully encounter adult versions of Eleven and Mike, along with the rest.Anyway, the storyline is great not just does it feel a little like ""The X-Files"" with the shadow organizations, conspiracies, psychic powers, monster, etc. But also, the show draws inspiration from H.P. Lovecraft, as it deals with otherworldly realms and the creatures that exist in them. I like the pacing, which is a steady pace when it gets further it starts to pick up more and more speed. The show is the serialized structure but it's not too long, there are twists along the way but their good twists because there is actual weight to them because they make sense and also keep the story's eye on the ball.And of course, the true strength of the show for me are the Strange Raiders characters themselves. These guys are my favorite fictional protagonists of all time, I love how all of them are well rounded and develop throughout the course of the show and as they develop, I feel they all get better.Their all ordinary people with ordinary powers (well except for Eleven but she not invincible) but all work well with whatever they have, to the best of their ability, but also their best weapon which is their wits and teamwork. None of them asked to be thrust into the strange predicaments nor even to save our realm from evil, but here they are, and they always give it their all and watch each other's backs in the process.I'll describe a couple of my favorites since there is so many.Mike he's great, he's sort of the leader of the bunch. His character I can really relate to as he's a bit like myself in real life. I like that his character is a geek but he's not the stereotypical kind, despite playing a lot of D and D and pop culture he open minded to other things outside of those things.What I love about him is he has strong emotions, he isn't afraid to do what is right and what he knows must be done which makes him a guy with plenty of guts.Eleven is also great really like the actress Millie Bobby Brown who looks like Natalie Portman when she was that age. She sort of a young Jean Grey as she is armed with her psychic powers which are cool as we see them in action, though her powers do have their limitations as it puts strain on her physically which is where she gets constant nose bleeds which at times makes me concerned for her, but this limitation just reminds us how human she truly is.She's a character that constantly evolves throughout the show, as well as the most sympathetic, despite being so young so much of her life has been taken from her. Which in a way makes us even more want to bet on her to win not just against evil but in being able to discover and make a life for herself.It's funny and interesting seeing her orient herself with even the littlest conveniences, which makes sense when you think about it. But I really like how she slowly but surely opens as she spends more time with her friends the Strange Raiders.Mike and Eleven are one of my favorite fictional couples up there with Hikaru and Misa from ""Macross"", Tom Paris and Elena from ""Star Trek Voyager"" and others in my book. Despite so young, their interaction and feelings for one another are beautiful and strong. Both really can open up to one another that they can't do with anyone else and we see how slowly and gradually it becomes something more.Even like how both react toward it where they both don't totally understand it all and it's strange to them, but also exciting and fascinating they both just stop thinking and go with it. I also feel both are truly good for one another as they not just watch each other's back but also make each other strong as their interaction motivates them to do more or break whatever limits them.Life truly can be strange and wonderful all at once.Rating: 4 stars"
1584,This is how fantasy/horror should be done. The story has layers like an onion. You can peel them back and see how it is all interconnected. No scene is wasted. No drama without growth. The horror is believable and tickles your brain. The acting is brilliant and the conclusion is satisfying.
1585,"It's a good showVery well put together, the 80s is actually created by someone who knew the 80s not some millennial concept.Story is steady with strong characters"
1586,"Stranger things is great. Not even from the 80's, but its whole 80's feel is really cool. The acting is great. The kids are very relatable. Filled with suspense, humor, great dialogue and story, good action scenes, and very good twists. First season was really good. Second season got even better. Third season was amazing. Not a lot of shows where all seasons are really good. And its very rare where the first season is really good, and the rest just keep getting better. Very entertaining, well made horror/sci-fi series."
1587,"(A little tiny weeny bit of a spoiler) I love the show but.... i dont like elevens and mikes romance, it was forced super hard and every secene with both of them in season 3 was like nails on a chalkboard... not fun"
1588,"Stranger things, written and directed by the Duffer Brothers, follows a group of young teens and their families in the 1980's through their rather supernatural and sci-fi adventures.This show immediately became one of my favourites on Netflix following it's pilot episode. It's creatively directed and written with tension and horror, yet retains a great deal of fun and humour. It's the imaginative adventures of monsters and secret laboratory conspiracies that I myself as a nerd have only fantasised about in youth, brought to reality.I don't think I'm in the minority when I say that the direction of Stranger Things revitalised 80's nostalgia. Thankfully the show doesn't rely on said nostalgia to carry the weight of the story. It has a great balance of sci-fi and fantasy horror, yet retains a heartwarming theme of family and friendship, along with that nostalgia effect to really create something special. Throughout the story we're introduced to characters we care for. Which is one of Stranger Things' biggest strengths, the characters.The chemistry between each character, the group of young child actors in particular, is perfection and great casting in general. The best kind of shows are those that have you entertained by everyone on screen, whether they're likeable or not. The show is visually stunning and the production design is off the charts. You really do feel like you're seeing 1980's Indiana. It'd be a crime not to mention the amazing music by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein who present an electronic style retro score as part of the nostalgic essence.Stranger things kicks off with what I believe to be flawless season, though I find that as the seasons go on the writing feels a little repetitive in some respect, and it can also come off slightly plot driven at times. Thankfully due to the characters you invest in, all the fun and excitement, and everything else it has to offer, you lose yourself in its glory rather than its flaws. Stranger things one of the best Netflix has to offer."
1589,I will admit. I waited till February of 2017 to watch this. Why didn't I watch it earlier. Id be asking myself that question but either way I did. Didn't think I'd like it and while it took a little bit I was hooked. Binged the first season as well as the second and same with the third. I am a sci-fi fan so this caught my attention. Has it's fair share of horror elements as well. But if you like Steven King and Steven Spielberg and have ever wondered how well aspects of their work fit together. This show answers that question. Into horror? Watch it. Sci-fi. You'll get pulled right in. Want to try something different?. Give it a shot. Season 1. 8/10 Season 2 8.5/10 and season 3 9/10.
1590,"Season 3 was a major disappointment. The only good thing that came out of the season was the Russian involvement. There has always been that Cold War vibe in the show that finally got addressed in season 3. However, most of it was very lame. My only guess is they must make season 3 innocent and corny as a set up for a very very dark season 4 as this is the only way they will redeem themselves. Best part of season 3 was the throwback of eleven crushing the coke can with her powers. They really need to go back to basics in season 4. Major Russian involvement and start using Martin brenner. REDEEM YOURSELVES!!"
1591,"...ALL TIME GREATEST SHOWS ON ITS NETWORK! It definitely does justice paying respects to Stephen King. If you haven't watched the show, I highly recommend TO STOP PROCRASTINATING AND WATCH IT! You ain't gonna be disappointed"
1592,"Funny, entertaining, adictive. One of the best series I have ever watched. The soundtrack is immersive and the storyline is well constructed. The 80's climax it's a delight. The actors, even the youngers, are an amazing surprise. The terror it's not harmful. Its thrilling and funny to watch. To almost all ages without restriction.
The series could have ended in the second season very nicely, but, thank god, we will have another one. So, please, don't screw this up, guys!"
1593,"Strange how so many love this soooo overacted try hard of everything once original. The story isn't so bad - the cast are great (mostly) and it has its moments. But generally speaking there is so much wrong with 'ST' where does one start. Maybe its in the direction or choice of music or lamentable 70's commercially unknown songs. Its just, there is no adjective to describe it.. In time its possible one could become 'invested' in the characters which is the aim of a good story but not so much here. The series really doesn't concentrate on a particular member for long and it tends to jump about so much the story does become confusing. Oh of course you have your inevitable big name in there somewhere - sorry two names but mostly unknowns. Not that theres anything wrong with that but you would have to ask Algernon about his flowers."
1594,"On the whole the acting's ok (if you ignore Wynona's level 10 the whole way through and Jonny's inability to do anything other than the standard open mouth). It makes no sense, moves at a snails pace and tries to weave in so much that it's banking on us not understanding to give the producers a reason to make 7 series when it could all be done in two. Think Lost.
Smacks of another programme that had a compelling idea and ended up being complete rubbish. It's a 3/10 at best."
1595,"Really predictable, easy story, lots of holes. Characters trying to act like they're cool but not as cool as they think they are. It's enjoyable about 30 percent of the time, then you're just bored."
1596,"Having heard nearly nothing but good, actually great, things about 'Stranger Things', despite it attracting some criticism (like a lot of popular shows do these days, interest was high watching it. Due to being so intrigued by its concept and various ideas and tones.'Stranger Things' on the most part is deserving of the love it has, for me its lack of originality was not a problem because it executes so much of everything else so wonderfully. It is not perfect and not an even in quality show, but when it was good, as shown in a quite excellent first season, boy was it more than great. Along with 'The Crown' and 'House of Cards' in its prime, 'Stranger Things' is one of the best Netflix has done and in well above their general standard. Do agree absolutely that Season 2 is not near as good as Season 1. There are still a lot of elements present in Season 2 that was especially good about the first season and part of the show's appeal, but somehow the writing didn't always feel as tight, focused or rounded and some of it was a bit forced and obvious. Also felt some of the effects weren't as refined either. While the acting is great from almost all the cast, Winona Ryder's melodramatic over-acting did feel at odds with everything else.Everything else is executed so well. A vast majority of the time, apart from the lack of refinement of some of the effect in the second season, the production values are just great. Very stylish and atmospheric, with some truly beautiful images that one can't believe such high quality comes from a Netflix show. The music is haunting and nostalgic. Writing is thought probing and has a lot of brains and heart, with some nice gentle humour that doesn't overpower, some truly poignant drama and tension. The story is rich in atmosphere and even though the story ideas are not original and have been understandably described as derivative, it's the execution and telling of these ideas that makes one look past that. The suspenseful mystery elements, the inventive and intriguing sci-fi elements and dark and disturbing horror elements are beautifully balanced and handled adeptly on their own. With an emotional core and nostalgic homages added as well.Characters are compelling and it's the chemistry and interaction and how the relationships are written that makes 'Stranger Things' work so well. Excepting Ryder, the acting is terrific. The standouts being Finn Wolfhard and particularly Millie Bobby Brown (such an expressive actress in a beyond-her-years subtle way), if they continue to act this way and be wise with their career choices they are very likely to have big careers.Overall, very good show and at its best excellent. Do wish that Season 2 was as good as the first though. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
1597,"Love love love it. Actually, I'm not even sure I like it but it drew me in from day one and I'm hooked and have to know what will happen next. The story, the characters, everything. Several ""bloopers"" but hey, nobody is perfect. Casting for instance. Kali for example. You can't have someone with an accent play a girl who didn't have an accent as a child and who was raised in a lab, therefore wouldn't have developed an accent. Don't get a Danish actress to play a girl that shouldn't have an accent."
1598,"Stranger Things is a catching TV series from Netflix, in which a 12 year-old boy named Will (Noah Schnapp) goes missing on his way home from his friend's house. His mother Joyce (Golden Globe-winning Winona Ryder) will do everything in her power to find her son, including an investigation with the local police, who don't seem to be as hopeful for finding Will as she is. During the investigation, Will's friends try to solve the mystery as well. The three boys, Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Mike (Finn Wolfhard) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), will not only find themselves searching for answers, but also in a bigger adventure than they expect. This plot includes extraordinary elements as government experiments, parallel realities and an unusual visit from a uncommon girl, who Mike will end up naming Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). On the one hand, the viewer can expect to be tense for the most part of every single episode, trying to guess the answers along with the characters; on the other hand, the young boys will make it delightful to watch, providing moments of good laugh - they are kids, after all - and impressing the viewer with their amazing acting skills. Should you be looking for a silly TV series to watch just to spend time an not get involved with the plot, certainly this will not be the TV series for you. It goes the other way: it catches your attention, you get fully involved in the plot, it keeps you on the edge of your sit and it's very likely that you will binge-watch the first season (even if you didn't intend to). This happens due to the amazing actors and actresses skills, specially from the kids - that might surprise you, since we usually expect better acting skills from more experienced actors or actresses. The 80's environment will get the viewer back to that decade: the beginning of technological experiments, the soundtrack, the clothing and the cars; it's a full immersion in the 80's. People who lived through that decade might feel a special bond with the TV series, they may feel like living in that decade once again. I don't intend to drop spoilers, but I have to say that once the answers start to become more clear during the last episodes, the viewer will start to feel relieved and a little curious, maybe thinking ""If they find Will now, there won't be a next season"", right? Not right. The fact is that the last few minutes of the final episode leaves a enormous cliff hanger that will leave you with high expectations for the second season. All I want to say is that you will not be disappointed by ""Stranger Things"", watch it, pay attention to the details, invite your friends to watch it with you and enjoy it."
1599,"To me watching Stranger Things was really engaging. Even though I'm not a native speaker it was quite easy to understand, it was the first TV show that I watched without Portuguese subtitles. A bad aspect was that the rhythm was very slow sometimes because maybe they wanted to keep the mystery until the last episode. In spite of that the actors were really capable and great. I recommend the show to everybody who likes terror and thriller, mainly teens."
1600,"By the end of the first episode was hooked. The acting capabilities of these kids was honestly amazing. I don't leave many reviews on things, sometimes if it was really bad or really good. This was honestly really good. The sci-fi part of it is super interesting and i loved how they showed the Upside Down just like how Will described it as ""Home but colder"", or something along those lines. At first yo will hate Steve, but near the end when he helps Jonathan and Nancy it shows a positive character development. I loved the person who played Eleven, he acting was amazing, considering she didn't talk much and she had to show her emotions through her facial features, which some actors find hard to do and stay quite plain. MY favorite character was probably Dustin, due to the humor he brings to the story and he is a real ice breaker when things get tough between Lucas and Mike. Mike and Eleven's little relationship is also super cute. The animations blew m mind as well, like when they were in the Upside Down and there were small spores flying everywhere (Which kind of reminded me of The Last Of Us) this series had a kind of 'Super 8' feeling to it, but personally i think it was much better. The story line was more in depth and the characters have a great development throughout the story. There aren't any bad jump scares in it, but it can get a little creepy a times, like when you can see the demogorgon in the photo, which you wouldn't have noticed before, or when you can see the face of the demogorgon trying to get through the wall. I think the implementation of the lights was also super cool, like they knew when someone was in the Upside Down when the lights flickered. I also loved how Mrs Byers kind of made a makeshift Ouija board on the wall, using paint to make the letters and Christmas lights to let will flicker which letter he wants to show. Awesome!Jonathan and Nancy's little coupley moments are also super cute."
1601,"This series is excellent. The acting, the atmosphere and the directing. A thriller/mystery without paper thin characters. But what blew me away was the homage to the late 70s, early 80s classics. Somehow they took the best from Poltergeist, It, The Thing, Close Encounters & a lot of other cult classics and packaged it into an awesome 80s setting with a creative twist. Modern, and not too corny. I found it downright charming at times. If you aren't a movie buff I think you'll enjoy it for what it is. If you are a movie buff, I think you'll find this series a treat! Also, the kids and the Sheriff in this gives some amazing performances. I don't really have too many gripes with this series. Don't expect a hack n' slash. It's a Thriller/mystery, and it's one of the best I've seen. Recommended!"
1602,"The first thing you'll think when you begin to watch the carefully crafted and incredibly intense Netflix original is that it's similar to JJ Abrams' 'Super 8'. The characters, the setting, the story, the atmosphere. Yes, I know Super 8 wasn't the best praised movie ever, but this does the 80's scfi drama better than anything I've seen. It's completely nostalgic. The characters are very well written, the pacing is extraordinary, the acting is perfect, the cinematography is also fantastic. This is a good show, and it introduces multiple young acting talents, as well as reviving some careers. So your probably thinking, 'why did I say it's overrated?' Well this might just be me, but I felt as if the show was leading up to a huge plot twist. But it didn't, and the show just kinda solved everything at the end. With the exception of the end scene in the bathroom, that was done very well.But aside from this, the show is a fun intense drama that captures the 80's perfectly."
1603,"So I'm going to make this as quick and as fair as I can. Whilst the show is actually good, and it was hard for my girlfriend and I to not watch it in one sitting. There were still some huge problems with the show and I'll just go over the 5 main ones:1. The show copied a lot of things from movies like 'Alien', 'E.T', 'Pulse', 'Carrie' and a dozen other movies. Watching Stranger Things is like watching a mix of many of the unique things that made other movies good (or bad). With some things it's really cool, but in others you get the feeling that the writers were really damn unoriginal.2. Some of the characters completely suck. The worst being 'Winona Ryder'. This b.... cries for tens of minutes every single episode. When she isn't crying, she's screaming about how she isn't crazy. We get that she's suffering like mad but they took her dramatic behaviour way, way too far. Honestly it gets to the point where it started to give us a physical headache and had us both shouting ""We get it already!"". The constant yelling (and fighting) from the kids also got a bit much too.3. There are BIG plot holes and I had some issues with some of the outcomes. Why did the 'Bad men' let Hopper live (but kill the cook at the start) and why did they just sit back and observe everyone instead of being more active about containing the situation? Why was Barb just completely forgotten? I mean we only see her mum make one concerned call about her Also did you really have to steal the ending again, from Alien?4. A lot of the themes are ridiculous. Examples are when the kids are being actively chased by the 'bad men', 'El' just flips a car and they all decide to just stop chasing them. It's not like they couldn't have continued on after them. In general the 'bad men' are very well bad, at tracking down a single girl who continuously leaves a path of destruction and chaos in her wake. Mike's father is also overly useless, and again Barb's mother In fact all of the parents just seem to be really messed up in Hawkins.5. There's way too much feminism bullcrap going on in the movie. Insert the overweight, ginger lesbian, the androgynous looking female child lead with the shaved head with insane PTSD issues who is 'triggered' by everything. Oh, I almost forgot the token 'black kid' and the kid with a lisp. So that's: 1 'overweight ginger lesbian (wow killing 3 birds with 1 stone), 1 'person of colour', 1 'androgynous female with extreme PTSD' and 1 person with a birth defect. You could also throw Johnathan's extreme social awkwardness in there too and maybe the science teacher's Asian girlfriend.Putting all this aside the movie is definitely still interesting enough that it was hard for us to stop watching to go to sleep for the night. There's enough content for you to make some presumptions but not enough that you still end up getting a lot of things wrong. Though, at times the pacing is really slow and there's a lot of unnecessary stuff thrown in.Unfortunately, the biggest problem with the show is just the amount of hateable, badly developed or totally useless characters, and the undeniable incompetence of the 'bad men' and also Mike's parents are just so useless (really the father WTF). A lot of characters just feel like cannon fodder and give absolutely nothing to the setting or plot.I'll give it a 'B minus'. It's worth watching, but unless you're a potato, you will have your gripes with it when you're done."
1604,"Stranger things is best watched at once, binge watching all 8 episodes, as this really makes you appreciate how intricate and detailed the storytelling is, being presented as a long movie more than a series. The characters are extremely releateable, and diverse, with multiple characters and subplots which all connect back to each other in brilliant ways, leaving enough mystery for the inevitable season 2.The 80s nostalgia is hugely present, the series being clearly influenced by the likes of Spielberg, Stephen King among others, and the series is all the better for it.The soundtrack is also great, creating an eerie presence, whilst also featuring classic tracks from the period.Overall, I highly recommend checking it out."
1605,"Wow what a unexpected blast this series is. Im steel stunned and wandering what a heck did i just watched?! Acting, camera, music, drama, mystery everything right on the spot. This series is a real jewel i want go into spoilers and all im gonna say is you gotta watch this. Of course we have seen things like this before but not in this unique and original way. 80s settings is done perfect. I was thinking at first this is some kids goonies like series but boy i was wrong. What should i say more than judging from the first episode looks like i have new favorite. I keep my fingers crossed and hope other episodes want spoil perfect atmosphere and settings. Im just wandering who has given this series less than 10. What would you expect more? Just Be sure you don't let your kids watch this ;)"
1606,"Would be so much better if every other word wasn't curse words...but then again, anything that comes from Netflix is constantly laced with profanity, as if no good content can be made without it. 🙄"
1607,"Season 1,2 & 3 brilliant!
People on here saying season 2 & 3 are bad!
You need to do different things with a show like this especially if kids are involved."
1608,"Hiya leo its Luke
Stranger things is the most amazing show I'm obsessed"
1609,"Excellent character development for all characters. Best season as far as fleshing out the characters is concerned.
Left me teary eyed in the end, Billy was my favourite character from Season 2."
1610,I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking but season 3 is the best so far. Slightly campier in tone but better for it! Absolute god like writing and acting from all involved.
1611,"Love. Me. Passionately. How AMAZING is Season 3 guys?After most people thought the Duffers lost track with season 2 and went into loopmode with just more Netflix money they literally blew this one out of the mall park.A phenomenal new approach, splitting the plot into three seperate interesting, funny, charming and well-paced story lines slowly intertwining into a grand finale, that's worth over 600 days of ""Whats gonna happen?""Don't listen to the mad crybabies here downvoting everything what's not GoT, it's an 8-episode nailbiter for one amazing ride that's gonna fuel pages over pages til season 4 with everything we missed during the first time we watched it...The amount of easter eggs is just ABSURD, coincidentally I felt the urgent need to watch 'The Thing' few days ago and went down into this rabbit hole (again) about the most important questions in life and ST3 definitely gave some extra fuel to that on top.Highly recommended, these networks are just spoiling us right now: 'Chernobyl', 'Dark' and now this, what a time to watch TV!"
1612,"I immensely enjoyed some aspects of this show but other aspects really drug it down. For one, the sound quality is horrible. Some scenes I have to have the TV turned up all the way to even half understand what is being said but then suddenly and without warning everything gets much much louder. It was not a minor annoyance and gets this at least a full star lower rating. I suspect that they do this in an attempt to startle viewers, which is not acceptable considering I had to strain to hear some dialog. Another thing I did not like is the original music scoring, which came off like an '80s B movie soundtrack (think- the Halloween 3). I also found the fact that they could not get away from '90s through present scare tactics (scenes where they try to startle the viewer instead of doing something more subtle that might instill real fear in the viewers- this actually seems to be a lost art). I also feel that certain characters did things that were extremely unproductive in regards to successfully accomplishing anything. Over all I enjoyed this but am only giving it 5 stars because of how badly they messed up aspects that could have easily been fixed."
1613,"I watched it all last weekend, yawning, strangely enough, or often waiting to hurry up and finish the damn thing. Stephen King highly recommended it, but it rips him and others off so thoroughly, that although it usually isn't downright boring, it certainly never thrills or sends a tingle down your spine with anything approaching cinematic ingenuity. Even the cinematography is dull. King also praised Wynona Ryder. What?? She spends the entire series squealing unsympathetically like a twiggy near-hag twit. The black kid, whose last name is McLaughlin (please give it back, kid), should never act again, and I found Matthew Modine's hair more disturbing than anything else in this silliness. Fun? If you don't like thrills, laughs, scares or surprises from your sci-fi horror, I guess. C-"
1614,"I remember watching the first season when it had just been released. It was fantastic. It had an interesting and myserious premise and i remember finding it quite scary at times. It was eerie and tense - we werent quite sure what was happening but it certainly was strange as the title suggests. The characters chemistry was fun and believeable. The ending to the season could have been better but overall pretty enjoyable. It became one of my favourite TV shows.Unfortunately, it seems like a lightening strike once kind of show. Throughout the series the cast has been great! Its just that everything else hasnt. Although it keeps its 80s aesthetic what is really needed to uphold a series is a story. The first season didnt entirely clear this up for us - and neither did the following two. We are at the end of season 3 and honestly i dont know what the show is about anymore. Also, the same formula is being carried out. Step 1 we see a new threat, Step two split up and work in teams, step 3 all come back together to defeat evil monster. Its sad to say this series got tired quickly.Side note - Every film i have seen since this series release that contains a young cast gets compared to stranger things. Guys, ST did not invent the 80s. Nor did it invent kid adventure films. Give it a rest eh?As an optomist im hoping season 4 can bring this series back around and i would really welcome it. Fingers crossed."
1615,"Fun, corky and lively tale fulled with suspense. Perfect for that Syfy fix."
1616,I came late to this and really liked it even though it can be cheesy in places. Mostly what makes the show is the kids. But I can't see how they're going to keep it going. The kids are getting older and I can't see where they will go next. But maybe the writers will surprise me when it comes back. The first three seasons are a good watch!
1617,"I really had to remind myself of what a great production it was, since it blew over so quickly and no one is talking about it anymore. I would gladly give 10/10, but 2 points off for killing Barb"
1618,"This is a review up to the 3rd season.Taking inspiration, and copy-paste from cult movies are two different things: who watched horror movies such as Carpenter's ""The Thing"", or Scott's ""Alien"", will have for sure some deja-vues. I understand that this series wants to glorify the 80's, but there are too many references, and sometimes in just a few minutes. It seems that creators did not want to go a little bit further, in order to create something that reminded these years, but at the same time was different.Don't get me wrong: I really liked Stranger Things, but I do not think it deserve to have 9 or 10 stars. I understand that this is fantasy/horror, so the show doesn't have to be 100% realistic, but there are a few, big problems that cannot be unnoticed: for the entire first season children manage to hide in Mike's home El, and parents do not even notice her. Adults very often leave their children alone, with some teenager, even if they know how dangerous is the situation, to go to complete some kind of side quest, that will help to defeat the monster. These are the two unsettling ones, in my opinion.The show is very entertaining, characters are interesting and funny, and actors are very skillful, especially Millie Bobby Brown that actually surprised me a lot. CGI is particularly good, especially in seasons 2 and 3, you can see that a lot of effort was put to make creatures. The story is very catching and I was hooked up since the first episode, I watched the entire series in a couple of weeks, binge watching 3/4 episodes per session. The Duffer brothers, know how to keep you on front of the TV. Even the ""Russian wants to conquer America"" side plot, that at the beginning made me roll my eyes, was good, because it was not so important as I thought.If you love horror and fantasy stuff, and you feel a little bit nostalgic about the old 80s (but also 90s), watch it. Do not expect the most original creatures or plot ever made, but it is still worth your time."
1619,"If it wasn't for all the amazing and thorough work in developing the set and props it would be just another meh netflix series. They even mimic various commercial products like coke, burger king, etc.. so that it looks like it's set in the 80's"
1620,"From the get go, the bad guys and storyline are predictable. That was a real let down.
BUT, the characters interactions make up for it.
On a side note, why does EVERY SINGLE movie worth watching HAVE TO HAVE in it? Not once,
but two or more times???? It's used so often that the shock value is pretty much gone. I don't have a king so quite telling me to Forucation Under the Concent of the King (you can put that together I assume)."
1621,"This series never lets me down. I was reluctant to start S1 because the whole premise didn't seem appealing. I have to admit, I was wrong. Although part of the cast are young, they deliver great, awesome, flawless performance. Everything else is superb too - drama, the songs, the visuals, everything. And how the songs are aligned with what is presented in the story.I came back to change my rating from 9 to 11. The IMDb UX is a bit disappointing on that part.And let me answer some of those ""we want more suspense and mystery"", ""it's cliche"" reviews.1. Suspense is there.
2. How can there be mystery if we already know the lore? Instead we've got a coming of age story, and the transition to Cold War. The show is gaining more and more scale (and hopefully budget). Isn't that great.
3. And of course it is cliche. The human's soul is thousands of ages old and there are only so many levers to move it. It's either that or a story no one wants to know.Spoilers below.P. S. And yeah, it was a bit cringe-y watching Mike in particular moments... I wanted him to support El in that final episode, but the presented version is more realistic and it lets El to exercise initiative.Having a hint regarding S4 is the best present they could've made at the end :)"
1622,"#StrangerThings3 4/5
#hopper stole the show.
I really enjoyed except 1st 2 episodes were just teenage fun frm E3 it's too intresting till end.SPOLIER... ALERT
Bad is #Hopper Died seriously I didn't like @strangerwriters what you did."
1623,"If you like Super8 and the new IT Movie stuff like that you will probably love this, haven't watched season 2 yet but season 1 was Brilliant."
1624,"First, props to Wynonna Rider for pulling off the obsessive mom, who dancea on the edge of crazy. I was a kid in the 80s so to watch the Stranger Things kids behave like I did and the attention to 80s detail the director made it like they were born in that era, even though they weren't, was pretty incredible. If you think about it, Drew Barrymore was a child in E.T. which was set in the 80s but was current time back then. The team did a fantastic job making Stranger Things feel like a modern-day 80s series."
1625,"One of the greatest shows ever, it has good story telling , amazing actors , and a lot of 80's call backs, however their is some mild language and a few disturbing images but should be fine for tweens and teens alike , lovers, A MUST WATCH FOR Everyone."
1626,"One of the greatest shows ever, it has great story and everything, it does however have mild language and some disturbing images but should be fine for tweens and teens alike. Definitely a must watch for everyone who enjoys sci-fi or drama. A MUST WATCH FOR EVERYONE."
1627,"The Duffer's were very clever with their way of introducing each and every character in the subtle ways they do. My ONLY complaint would be regarding season 2 - to be completely honest, the plot can feel a little lost at some times (especially during season 2, episode 7. Without giving away too much of the plot, it was very unnecessary and I could still see Stranger Things being as great as it is without this episode in place). Nonetheless, I feel the casting was spot ON and these are some incredible child actors we are looking at here, wise beyond their years and much better than some of the corny Disney/Nickelodeon ""actors and actresses"" we usually see on screen today."
1628,"This show is really good. Season 1 is better in my opinion, but season 2 is also very good. The episodes end on cliffhangers, which make you want to watch every episode. Really cool show."
1629,I love the first season although it relies heavily upon nostalgic homage . It manages to flow well and you care about the characters and Mike and Eleven are the standouts .I also enjoyed the score in both seasons.Season 2 felt almost like a reboot of the first season and really didn't add much for me to the series and not sure I'm excited for the new season .also mike suddenly seemed to not matter as much .
1630,The show is amazing. Some of the characters have a sense of humor. In the first season I hated Steve until the finale. Dustin is great and just everything with the show is fantastic.
1631,"This series is by far one of the best Netflix has put out. It has a great storyline that is fast paced and keeps you entertained to say the least. The series has great leading roles each with there very own additional characteristics to the show. You do have to watch this series in order to make the most sense when watching. It is also filled with excitement, danger, sarcasm, and so much more. It puts a creative spin on what trouble comes to following dangerous things if you will. Watch the first season!"
1632,"From an upside-down world filled with fauna consuming horrifying creatures to a bumbling romance b/w two preteens , the wins over out hearts by beautifully intermixing the two themes alongside some spectacular background music .definetly one of the most thrilling shows that explores the untouched terrain of a parralel ,much darker , universe. a must watch!!!"
1633,"At first glance, you see this show as the typical classic theme: just a bunch of kids who realize something bad is happening on their town. You're wrong. Stranger Things is packed with action, adventures, drama, humor and tons of 80s references. Every new episode is a new entrance to the fantastic world of Hawkins, Indiana. Every new episode is packed with glorious terrifying nail-bitting bone-chilling moments. It's one of those shows where you don't get it anything at the beginning but in the end you end up loving it. It's one of those shows that demands - and deserves - to be called ""a cult classic"". Stranger Things deserves that title. The performances by both, the adult cast, the teen cast and the kids cast, are astounding. I think they made a great job with the characters. It's a classic, from beginning to end. If you're desperate on searching for a great horror 80s series, your search is over, because you have ""Stranger Things""."
1634,"Slap bracelets, scrunches, walkmans, rubics cubes, and homephones connected with a cord. Many teenagers in my era would consider these '80s essentials to be ""too much work"" or ""not easily accessible enough"" but in the television series ""Stranger Things"", life as a kid is not about having the latest technology at one's fingertips yet instead it allows for kids to understand the importance of mystery, friendship, and heartbreak.
The show's main characters; a friend group of four middle-school boys, a middle-aged overweight cop, a struggling single mom and a supernatural exception. This show is simply an amusement and positive entertainment for all ages. What appears to be a rather ""average teenage"" television series, later becomes one of the greatest science fiction adventures of the millennials generation."
1635,Bang on from ep1 to ep8 in season 1 & now watching season 2
1636,"Stranger Things (Season 1 and 2) is brilliant. It is a clever combination of elements of Stephen King's ""it"" and Spielberg's ""E.T"" as well as combining elements from some of the most recognisable pieces of pop culture from the 80s.The story is interesting following the disappearance of Will Byers where Winona Ryder plays (arguably) her greatest role in a while. It also follows a girl who has escaped from a scientific facility where people have been experimenting on her.Without spoiling it, both series are brilliant. They both have there ups and downs (notably S2E7) but overall the story really carries it and the build up is perfect. Effectively there are three stories running alongside all the way through. Joyce and Hopper trying to find Will, Eleven and Mike doing the same thing but also exploring Elevens background and a bit of a teen story with Nancy, Jonathan and Steve.It takes a push and a few episodes to get you gripped but by the last two you'll be so glad you stuck with it. Eventually, all the stories combine powerfully and to awesome effect.The brilliance of ST is how its able to utilise the ""80s nostalgia feel"" in a way other films (like 2017s ""it"") couldn't. It doesn't focus on it or let it take up screen time, instead letting it sit in the background. The Duffer Brothers truly know how to helm the production.The one biggest flaw it seems to have is that it doesn't trust the audience enough to let the actors speak for themselves, annoyingly ruining the greatest moments of acting with silly unneeded flashbacks to events that have only just occurred. I wish filmmakers would trust audience members to grasp simple visual storytelling and emotion and not do that. Although this is more of a bad directorial decision than a writing issue.Stranger Things is well worth the watch, I absolutely love the tone of the show and the music is outstanding as well as perfect for the ambience. I feel it is a prime example of how we are living in the golden age of television. However, I'm only giving it a 9/10 because I feel the show hasn't yet reached its full potential and a few better directorial decisions and writing clean ups would make this show perfect."
1637,"First season was greatest of all the thing i have ever watched anywhere in the world. season 1 was full of thriller, my heart beat was quite high throughout the episodes. but season 2 was different, it was awesomely greatest show ever created on the earth. it was full of thriller, my heart was pumping too high. but episode 8 and 9 was, emotional for me, i couldn't stop crying, the scene where wills mom and brother and mike was reminding him all the things from his childhood, was awesome and emotional at the same time. again when El met with mike for the first time in season 2, that was emotional moment for me, i was too happy to express my feeling. and when mike kissed El, i was like in cloud 11. all the actors in the series was great, because i never realized or cared about the actors once, i was going along the story and the characters of that story. it was like, i am there with them. please don't kill El or Mike and please don't disturb their love story."
1638,Just everything is great and max is my favorite the second season is better in my opinion
1639,"This should could not be more perfect. First, the 80s nostalgia in it grabbed me right away. Although I wasn't a big Steven King or John Carpenter fan in the 80s (I was scared of their work!), it was impossible to grow up in the 80s and not be very much aware of them and their genre and style . This show pays great tribute to them and quite frankly does them better than they did themselves. 
I was (and still am) a big Steven Spielberg fan, and saw ET about 8 times when it came out. The homage this show does to that classic film alone makes it worth watching. If the films ET and The Thing had a love child, it would be this show. The writing is excellent, and the performances top notch. I don't think there is a single weak moment or episode. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat, if not screaming out loud in total shock & surprise. Quite freeky at times, so not for the light of heart. However, if you are like me and avoid horror movies because you like to sleep soundly at night, but are still kinda fascinated by them, then this is a good one. If you can still sleep after the first episode, you'll be fine. That one is as bad as it gets. And huge kuddos to Winnona Rider for such a great comeback. I was never a fan of hers but love her in this role. It's hard not to relate to her character, a very sad & broken soul whose love for others, especially her family, keeps her moving forward, reluctantly yet so powerful. Can't wait for Season 3!"
1640,"So I am obsessed with this Netflix original. Maybe I wasn't born in the 80's but it still takes me to Hawkins. The Duffer bros and Shawn Levy have truly created amazing characters. They take the time to express these characters' emotions through one scene, and they take the time to truly thrill you after a couple of moments.I wish I could give this show an 11, fans would get that joke. As well as what I have mentioned, this show manages to slip in comedy, romance, and suspense perfectly. And that is what makes this show a 10/10 Netflix original."
1641,"I like almost everything about this show but it's not perfect. The acting is well done (for the most part), it has a great soundtrack, it is beautifully shot, and it has a solid story. It does get a little repetitive in the second season but still very much worth the watch. The one thing that I really don't like is the constant reverberation sound that they put in the background. It reminds me of Beyond the Black Rainbow which is one of my least favorite movies ever. Overall it is a much watch for anyone who loves horror movies and grew up in the 80's. Don't listen to the haters, it really is this good."
1642,"Be prepared to not leave your seat . A fantastic masterpiece with great writing , Directors and cast."
1643,Stranger things is one of Netflixes best show going for them right now! It has an amazing story and season two has not dropped in quality at all. I really am excited to see a season three (if it happens) and I'm quite interested to see what happens next in Hawkins. If you are looking for a bingable show I would highly recommend Stranger Things!
1644,"It's pretty good escapist fare for the most part, great special F\X too !
If you like Science Fiction & movies from the 80's, then you're in luck ! As someone who is also a LHP Adept though IRL & is a hardcore supporter of the Dark Side, IMO it would be much better if they portrayed the one who inflicted a deluge on Earth & destroyed Babylon for no real reason at all(both according to the Bible)as the one real one causing Humanity all of the harm in the form of suffering in his name.I'm afraid I'd be on the ""monster's"" side :) They only want us to be independent-minded & rebels like them when facing oppression from the cruel & evil Abrahamic ""God"".Suspend disbelief though & you'll probably enjoy yourself :)"
1645,"This show is the best ever! I was itting on the couch with my friends we saw this had no idea whatbut was so we watched it, finished is 2 days, the best show I have ever seen! WATCH ITTTT NOWW"
1646,"Love the cast, the set, the storyline, the music (try playing the theme song in Spotify and watch what happens)At first, I doubted that I would find this show interesting, because it follows kids/preteens. However, with such a talented cast (and they're only kids!!) I was hooked. Especially Noah Schnapp, he amazes me every time. Furthermore, the show does not only focus on the kids, but also on their older siblings and their parents, which makes it possible for the whole family to sit and watch this together.This show is definitely one of the best shows on TV right now. It has everything. It's beautifully made, it's scary but also emotional, it's full of horror but also speaks to your heart. If you haven't already, go watch it, you won't regret. The Duffer Brothers has done an amazing job.However, there are one thing that saddens me, which doesn't have anything to do with the show itself. The very popular Millie Bobby Brown is getting paid a lot more (300.000 $ per episode) than her costars, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapps (200.000-250.000 $ per episode) in season 2 and perhaps afterwards. I think that's unfair, because yes she is talented, but so are the other kids. She is on the screen just as much as her other costars. I know her character is different, expressing emotions through her facial expression and therefore harder to do, but with her having like no lines, it outweighs and therefore has the same amount of work as the other kids.A lot of people keep saying that Stranger Things is nothing without Millie and they wouldn't be watching it if she wasn't in it, but I disagree. I wouldn't want to watch the series, if it only focused on her character. I think the ensemble cast is what makes this series so good, and therefore the whole cast deserves just as much praise as her. Literally all the attention is on her these days. Don't get me wrong, she is an amazing actress and does a lot for the show - but not EVERYthing"
1647,"Great Acting, Well directed and most important outstanding Script Stranger Things is a show worth your time"
1648,Every single season has amazed me and I love it ever actor is brilliant I will always watch this show
1649,"A spectacular mix of E.T., Super 8, X-Files, and more mystery supernatural Sci-Fi shows and movies. Stranger Things is powerful, stunning, and thrilling throughout the entire series
Picking up a year after they discovered Upside Down and the demogorgon was unleashed, Stranger Things 2 , turns everything up to eleven and shows off its bigger budget.
Season 2 is an emotional rollercoaster with the warmth of nostalgia, the terror of supernatural scaries and real-life monsters and the relatable charm of friends worth fighting for."
1650,"A fantastic show that has it's own take, unlike any other show or movie I've seen. The quality of the show, the actors and the editing is great, and is recommendable for everyone to watch. Can honestly be quite scary at times, but is so worth it and it's always changing - not the type of show you can predict every episode."
1651,"Goonies, IT, E.T., Stand by Me and Dungeons & Dragons... you name it, Stranger Things is an amalgamation of some fantastic legendary '80s adventure and coming of age movies. Spielberg and JJ Abram's Super8 film in 2011 did a similar thing (albeit set in 1979), but Stranger Things is more indulgent story-line given the full series treatment to tell its tale, then expand further in a richer and deeper second series (and now a third newly commissioned). What makes it so special is that it ticks so many boxes. The characters are well developed and very likeable (or suitably loathsome) and sourcing largely unknown actors (excluding Winona Ryder) works incredibly well at avoiding any preconceptions and typecasting. The music is simply fantastic, leading with its bassy electro intro credits it sets an eerily brooding and foreboding tone before hitting you with an 'old school type-font chapter screen that sucks the viewer straight back in time and into the damned village of Hawkins, just like the town of Derry in IT and from there it's a nostalgic mix of crude haircuts, BMX bikes, walkie-talkies, sneaking around parents, and strange goings-on that bond friends closer and strangers ever nearer in a supernatural adventure that presses all the buttons without ever feeling contrived or corny. Intelligent use of music, be it background tracks composed for the show or insertions of '80s classic hits proficiently build the mood, and when it comes specifically to moments of suspense its clever camera-work expertly delivers the thrills and shocks, even if you're expecting the monster or baddie to appear. All in all, it's just a fantastic nostalgic fun adventure."
1652,"This sci-fi/horror series stars Winona Ryder, David Harbour, Finn Wolfhard,
Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton and Millie Brown. This takes place in Indiana town, Hawkins during the 1980's and centers around single mother, Joyce Byers (Ryder), her son, Jonathan (Heaton), Police Chief, Jim Hopper (Harbour), Young boy, Mike Wheeler (Wolfhard), Mike's sis, Nancy (Dyer) and mysterious, young girl, Eleven (Brown) who has special powers. This is a good, suspenseful series with a decent cast, mainly Ryder and good, atmospheric score that has a Tangerine Dream & John Carpenter feel. 
There's also a Spielberg tone, obviously ""E.T."" and aspects of ""The X-Files,"" 
""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""The Thing."" If you grew up in the 80's as I did or enjoy sci-fi/horror, I recommend checking this out."
1653,"The most worthy series you are goin to watch.Plot,Characters with perfect starring made this show so much valuable. Though it is acted buy several youngs but i will not recommend this to someone who is under 18.Happy Watching."
1654,"This show is the best show I have ever seen!! I was hooked from the start of season one, and personally I think season two is better. This show had mystery, suspense , it scares you but it leaves you wanting more.
Be careful starting to watch this series, you will be hooked!"
1655,"Stranger Things is the most refreshing piece of TV work that I have seen in a very long time. I'm a TV-aholic and an avid movie fan. Stranger Things has manage to combine the best of both mediums. First and foremost, The Duffer Brothers have given us a very good story. It's crafted well with a realistic but dark location. The photography is superb, that along with the production design creates a terrific canvas for the odd tale. The casting is absolutely perfect. Each actor, young and old, fits beautifully into their segment of this simple but multi-level story. The special effects are eerie, bold and effective. The music is minimal which plays well into the overall presentation. When I watch TV much of the time, I might be on my computer simultaneoulsy. I have managed over the years to do both pretty well at the same time. But when I'm watching Stranger Things, I turn the computer off. I find the show absolutely compelling and I don't want to miss a single frame. 
This is the first Netflix show I've ever watched. Truthfully, I didn't know what to expect, but I assumed it would be of lower quality than network shows. To my surprise and delight, the production values are far superior to any network program. You can feel the thinking and sincere desire of the creators constantly as you watch.
I have to admit I love the young people in the show. Oh, the adults are excellent, but the four boys and the two girls are engaging and they are valid portrayals of young people. Dustin curses and without making jokes is absolutely hilarious, Luke gets angry but is loyal, Mike wants to lead and he leads well, Will is sweet and so vulnerable, Max (a girl) is all those things, and poor mysterious Eleven is so wounded inwardly that if and when she smiles, just for a second, your heart is warmed.
I have only one complaint about this show--there are so few episodes to view. Networks give you 22-24 shows per season. As of late 2017, after two seasons, there is only 17 of these brilliant productions. Now you don't want to rush the producers into creating more just to have more; you want them to maintain the quality. But guys, can't you at least give us 10 episodes per season?
Stranger things deserves every award out there for outstanding acting, writing, directing, photography and acting.
I hope it stays with us for a long time."
1656,"I watched the show because every time i visited my social media platforms, everyone and every site was promoting this show and saying things like: ""Stranger Things is the next big thing after GoT' and stuff like this. So I watched it and I was't disappointed but I also wasn't amazed. The Stranget Things overall is a very good show and I can recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it. But I also have to say that its over-hyped.I think that the show is very well made. The shooting is great, the music is fantastic, the whole atmosphere is super good and the acting is very nice too. But the best thing is the synergy between the characters and not only between the kids. But there are some weaknesses too. First of all, the story is very predictable. Even tho I never read the comic-book I was almost never surprised over time in the show, not everything but most of the time I was prepared for the things that happened. Most of the characters were well made. I really like the transformation of Steve and Nancy, the 'adult' characters are bad- ass and the Lucas/Dustin duo and rivalry is awesome. In same time I think that Jonathan and Mike were mediocre. Overall i think that the show is worth watching for sure, but it's not something indispensable."
1657,"since the last season we were left out with so many questions and season 1 finale kept us so desperate for more of the show. this season simply was a masterpiece. every thing we wanted to happen but didn't happen in season 1 happened in season 2 . the kids were simply amazing i just love them they are so cool and so so damn good in acting all of them the casting choices were on point every actor portrayed their character to a point that no one can replace them in any way . story line went falling down like a stream that lead to a water fall very nicely. but still confused why they added the 7th episode which wasn't matching that much to the main story line of this season that episode damaged the image of the show in some way as i think it wasn't that necessary but it wasn't bad either . new charters which were added out of nowhere wasn't a bad idea ether because they added some value of their own and they aligned them nicely with the main characters . Millie Bobby Brown did her job so well that none of the experienced actresses of any other TV show could even come close to her level she is gonna win a Oscar someday for sure (if she didn't screw up like other child actors )there are few people in the show who were overlooked because of the star power of the kids , Joyce Byers she just acted in a way how a mother would react and what a mother would do to get her son in a way no any person could do so without going insane . Jim Hopper i have nothing to say he is a brilliant guy . Steve Harrington he is just awesome he did many things that a guy who has a brain wouldn't do like fighting a demidog with no one else .just like season 1 kids all the kids including mad max was so cool i just love to see season 3 cant wait for itThe Duffer Brothers have made their name immortal with this show brilliant storytellingmy review 9.8/10 (0.2 reduced because episode 7 )"
1658,"Definitely better and more realistic than most of what you see on television. I appreciate the attention to detail. I was born, raised and still live in Indiana. I think this is a fairly accurate representation of life there during this time frame. However...I am several years older than the main characters. To me, there is a much more '70's feel to the show than '80's, but that may also be part of its genius. As a land-locked state, Indiana is often way behind the ""coasts"" in terms of fashion, pop culture, etc. This was even more true during the '80's before the internet. My sense is Hawkins is a ""town"" (we would call it a city) of about 20,000-30,000. My home town was much smaller, so some of the things Hawkins had, we didn't. Likely, the school would have been a ""junior high"", though, rather than a ""middle school."" In a bigger city, there might have been middle schools (my uncle taught at one), but for a town the size of Hawkins, the switch wasn't made until much later. But it's too late to change now, so don't worry about it!In the '80's, ""preppy"" was really big in Indiana. I was in college in the '80's and it was all the rage. It was also the beginning of ""designer"" clothing. So let's bring out the Fair Isle sweaters, penny loafers, oxford cloth shirts. Maybe some waffle stompers, down vests (see ""Back to the Future"") and Izod shirts, OK?Just a few thoughts."
1659,When I first saw strangers thing on Netflix I thought that is wasn't going to be a good TV show that I can watch over and over again. I suddenly got in to it when my sister started to watch it I got so into it I had to research about it and the cast which I have fallen in love with especially Millie Bobby Brown because she has help me through hard times when have got bullied just because I have ASD. I never knew she was deaf in one ear. you should watch it if you like sic-fi
1660,"Probably the best series culminating great casting, acting, directing, writing, lighting, filming and editing. The background music was adequate and more reminiscent of Dark Matter, aka 2017. Other than that, the 80's soundtracks were perfectly married to the scenes.Noah Schnapp is absolutely amazing in season two that would make Linda Blair proud. Unfortunately, I feel the weakest acting was Winona Ryder. Her incessant whining on every line was wearing. Sean Astin was cast perfectly for his role and a great addition to the series. All the young actors had well developed characters, a tribute to their acting abilities. I found the times they swore humorous, especially because they would repeat a word three times.Season 2's ending, although predictable, seemed necessary and welcomed.There are very few Netflix series, I am able to watch. Many of them use the ""F"" word in every sentence, during the first five minutes of the show. To me, that is just poor writing and is void of any context. It was nice to read the Duffer Brothers are thinking a maximum of four seasons. Great foresight to know when to quit. After all, child actors get older."
1661,"It feels like I'm watching The Walking Dead. The first few seasons are really good until they got so far that they ran out of interesting idea's for the show, they instead reused plots, adding lodes of unnecessary episodes about unnecessary characters we just can't root for, like that horrible episode called 'Swear'(probably the worst episode of the show). That alone just explains enough that the show is a dead end now. Of course the problems don't stop there. The dialogues really suffers from bad writing and acting and in season 7(3/10) it got even so worse that I cringed in almost every dialogue, which is just awful(I should have quit after season 4).I'm really afraid that Stranger Things will follow TWD in its footsteps. Of course I was really amazed about Season 1, which is just nearly perfect(9/10). In Season 1 they did not told us much about the other dimension: the Upside Down or that mystical monster and that is exactly why it was so good. The creators knew how much they need to show the audience about the unknown and the way how they tell us really felt intriguing to watch. Therefore they managed to keep the mystery in each episode. Season 1 also reminds me a bit of Ridley Scott's 'Alien'(the good one). Alien started really slow and we did not see the Alien much, not to mention that did not know much what it could do just like that monster in S1 of Stranger Things. This way of pacing is good horror. Alien and Season 1 of ST did really a good job in maintaining that tone of mystery in order to keep the eyes on the screen. Both are simply good horrors. However this mystery factor has its limits and especially in series, therefore it also only worked in the first season(s) of TWD, but after that the show just ran dry. It was simply not as catchy as the first Season. Now, Season 2 of Stranger Things is in my opinion pretty solid. I like the all round sphere(like in S1), I like the characters(especially Sean Astin as Bob Newby), but something felt really different. It was not much horror anymore, more like action at least the last two episodes. The plot is in general, just good(though it has some minor holes like when Will felt no pain even though the men trying to disinfect the laboratory multiple times), however we just knew too much about this giant spider-monster that controls the virus and consumes life on our world. The best part of this season therefore happen to be the first few episodes when I only saw a giant shadow and those dark visions of Will, which really felt terrifying. After episode 4 we know that the giant monster has control over Will and that is pretty interesting, but it would have been more interesting if they would've revealed that more. There are also other things that bothers me. The writing is OK, but it felt at times really forced for example when Eleven sees Mike with Max, or when Bob Newby got killed by Monsters. There were actually a lot of moments like those, but the way how they show it felt so obvious that it did not create much emotional involvement, more like 'of course'! The dialogues also felt at times unreal especially when the kids where talking, they just talked like adolescents, probably even older for example the interactions with Max and Lucas, who were just to young to talk with that sense of romance. The Set up is sometimes also a bit messy especially in the last episodes and that has to do that, even though the sheriff did not call for back up, there was no sign of governmental involvement after the incident at that laboratory. The parents of the children also seemed not to care one bit(well except for Joyce Byers, but that's it), for example when Dustin took in a young monster and his mother just happen to miss all of that even the sound of that thing, c'mon. As far as the new characters we got Maroy Bauman who is likable, but does not have offered us much of his share in the main plot yet. We also have Eleven's sister: Kali in episode: The lost Sister, which is probably the show's biggest misstep so far, since the whole concept(another person with powers) including that episode is way too out of place with the main plot and the all round style of Stranger Things not to mention that this episode is forced and beyond unnecessary. There were simply too many forced characters including Eleven's sister and therefore I could not really care much about Kali and her gang of rogues and their interactions with Eleven.Season 2 of Stranger Things slowly goes down a path that I can't follow anymore and I don't want to see how the show will end up in the same way as The Walking Dead did. The show is out of potential now as I see it. They told us pretty much all there is of the unknown in order to keep the show interesting to us and therefore I would have loved that Season 2 will be the end of the show, because there is no denial that there will be more. I'm really afraid that the show does not know when to put an end to it and that is why I won't watch any more of it after this season."
1662,"The show was awesome to watch. Intriguing plot, good acting, and everything moved along at a good pace. My only gripe is the last two episodes: everything seemed rushed, gory, and more like typical 21st century Hollywood. One thing I really liked about this show was how it focused on story and didn't rush into action or extreme plot development. In my opinion, this all changed in the end for the worse. Really wished it would have eased into the ending or cut the season off and continued the plot into season 3 more eloquently."
1663,"I have to say, I heard about this show when it first came out. I took my sweet time to watch it, though it was one of the rare shows that actually sounded interesting to me. When I watched the first episode, I WAS HOOKED! It was difficult to stop once I had started, but I did end up breaking the series up into two days. Each episode was better than the last. I did, though, have mixed feelings about how it ended. For me, it didn't leave enough on which to base an entire second season, but then, I'm not the writer. I am eager to see how the next season progresses. If you have the time, DEFINITELY check this series out. But do yourself a favor and make sure to watch it all before the next season starts"
1664,"Merits: The season is very short in compared to other TV series. This makes it watchable as you don't have to invest so much time- 8 episodes versus 22! The cast was excellent. Hats off to David Harbour and Millie Bobby Brown. They were brilliant! The Upside Down concept was good, though it couldn't be connected properly to the creature.Demerits: E05- Why didn't Nancy and Johnathan go together through a passage to the Upside Down? Was Nancy had that brevity? And how did she escape the passage, when it was shown that the creepy creature saw her! E07- How come Barbara couldn't be saved and Will was? At least they could have tried! The last major scene was entirely forced and contrived.. Eleven vaporized so that they can show her coming alive in the Second Season was totally unnecessary. Overall, a one-time good watch!"
1665,"Stranger Things (season 1) is set in 1983 and is an amazing recreation of that time period with great acting from all roles but especially great acting from all the child actors, some of the best I have seen.I really enjoyed the entire story from every episode of the first season. The cinematography was phenomenal and the story was perfect and gripping. As of writing this review I have watched 3 times and plan to watch it at least twice more before the next season airs."
1666,"Stranger Things, with no doubt was one of the best series of the last year, taking us to a different environment, and creating that atmosphere that. For other side, the history is a little predictable, and the end is very expected , but it was really good how the characters and the mystery coexist."
1667,"This is definitely a trippy series yet managed to suck me in just like the upside down place!The premise is a bunch of neighbourhood kids doing what you'd expect-riding bikes, playing games, sorting out the ups and downs of suburban life.The adults are going about their business in surreal yet predictable ways.Then one of the kids disappear and all heck breaks loose. Each episode gets stranger and stranger (hence the title) yet works in a weird old school horror flick sort of way. While the premise seems over the top, the writing is on point leading viewers down a fantastic sci-fi path that is refreshing, campy and entertaining. Each episode has an enjoyable 80s tempo.It's a fun series to watch and the acting is great.Winona Ryder plays her role with finesse and gusto as a nervous Nelly single Mom relentless in her pursuit to find her missing son. The closing scenes give us a happy ending where everything is back to normal and then suddenly in the blink of an eye we realize it's not.This well crafted final episode leaves us all waiting in anticipation for season two. Well done Netflix!"
1668,"This was an enormously enjoyable production and has something for everyone. The acting was superb, especially from the children. My only complaint is the size of the plot holes. Having introduced an interesting idea from mainstream science the writers seemed to forget the need for consistency with the idea in the narrative. Most of these loose ends and inconsistencies showed up in the final chapter. For pedants such as myself, the resulting plot holes took something of the shine off this otherwise excellent series. Finally, it is pleasing that we have a series here that has an actual end in sight, although the producers seemed to have left a chink open for a second series."
1669,"Please follow in the footsteps of The Wire and keep this series to a few seasons instead of falling in the trap of so many other series. Please wrap this thing up after a few seasons instead of staging it out simply to make more money. Too many serious are only concerned with making money as opposed to wrapping up a good story. You have the making for an incredible sorry but please, please don't drag this out and follow the follow the footsteps of Prison Break and Lost.I love this series and would be remiss if you thought you had to keep producing more and more simply to make more money. Holy crap IMDb, how much more do you need from me before you will allow this to be published. This clearly wasn't enough so screw you and your ten line minimum. Who can't write a concise review in under ten lines? Apparently I can't, which is why you aren't allowing this review to go through. If you think that a few lines isn't enough to give a concise review of this series, then you clearly need to talk to your programmers. Still not enough? Holy crap this site sucks majorly, maybe you should reconsider how long a review needs to be before arbitrarily blocking anyone that spends a few minutes writing a review."
1670,"I'll start right out with my reason for 8/10 as opposed to 10/10. In my personal opinion one thing all stories should explain especially mysteries is the how and why. The how and why is murky at best which left me feeling a bit confused about a few things. With that in mind, I watched this entire series in one day. For ten or so hours nothing mattered except bathroom breaks and snack refills. I kid you not, the very phrasing of the first chapter's title makes you feel like ""Ok we're going on a ride here"". Then there's the method they used to introduce the series title. Talk about a blast from the past! From then on, just be prepared to be transported to a different time. The set pieces alone are done well enough to give this a gander.One thing this series did well was mixing ""well known"" actors with people you literally never heard of. It has a great pull where the Winona Ryders reel you in and the new comers keep you there, knowing you don't have to see the same old style from the same old people, but also knowing you don't have to invest a lot of trust into a whole cast of newbies. The kids especially do a phenomenal job. While a bit cliché at times, considering their age, they were fantastic. You'll see almost immediately that Millie Bobby Brown is in a class of her own. Another thing I liked about this series considering it's a Netflix Original is that they didn't take advantage of the lack of censorship. There are no unnecessary sex scenes, every other word isn't a swear, and there's not a whole bunch of random drug use or killing. But not to the point where it seems like an after school special. It was simply done right. Now the general vibe of the series is very familiar as it pulls from just about every 80s sci-fi/horror movie you can think of. What they did well with that however is taking that familiarity and molding it into something new. I don't wanna get on a soapbox, but man was it nice to watch a movie about teenagers and not have it be them glued to their phones. I think whether anyone wants to admit it or not we all can use a break from the strangle hold social media has on us right now. Now that I think of it, I think that's why a lot of modern horror films don't work these days. Technology is all around us, so it's hard to suspend belief when you know that theoretically the entire world is one tweet away from witnessing a mystery taking place. In 1983 that was a different story. All in all I give it 8/10. Like I said, it locked me down for an entire day. The story is a good pace that keeps you interested. Some things probably could have been explained better, but who knows; as thorough as they were, some of the missing details was probably intentional. This is a good one for everyone. But if you're 30 and older and love a good nostalgia-esk experience, WATCH THIS SHOW!!"
1671,"I wanted to watch this show I had read so much about. I knew that reading the raving positive reviews would probably ruin it for me, I entered the upside-down with an open mind. It started off nice, set the story and characters firmly in place and proceeded on a constant slow pace, developing certain characters and story-lines all along until the end. What got me hooked on though was the mystery of it all and how the show will tie up the individual character stories. It did an okay job in that department and I feel like it could've been so much more. The overall story stood mediocre but gripping, throughout the eight episodes. Some of the characters introduced were unnecessary. Winona Ryder's, and the kids' acting was over the top at some points while David Harbour was a rock, perfect fit for the role. For a story based in the 80's, the slang that the kids use felt out of place, like the show's music. While I enjoyed the show, it left me feeling like I was missing out on something. People I know were going crazy about it and I just thought it was okay. Maybe I shouldn't have read the reviews beforehand, but the show needed a bit more work on the story and dialogue to be termed as ""Masterclass"".My Rating: 7/10 +1 for nostalgia. ""Should I stay or should I go"""
1672,"Can't understand why every is slating season 3. Show gets better every season , long live stranger things"
1673,"This show keeps to its established formula, a mixture of the best sci-fi, horror, and suspense elements of masters such as Steven Spielberg, Steven King, John Carpenter, and James Cameron to name a few, and it really works. (This season
includes subtle homages to the likes of Romero, the Terminator, the Evil Dead and others as well).The pacing is excellent and the shorter episode count always leaves you wanting more, unlike with some Netflix shows that go in excess of 10 and inevitably suffer from mid-binge lag.As this is a period piece of sorts, the 80's context and references further serve to establish and immerse the viewer into the various worlds and influences to which the show hearkens. For those of us who came of age in the 70's and 80's, these familiar landscapes really reignite the sense of awe and wonder felt when having first watched the many shows and movies referenced throughout, returning us to a sweet escape of simpler times.My only criticism is that some of the elements feel like a retread of the first two seasons, particularly the sometimes over-reliance on Eleven's abilities as if they were somehow novel again. As the stage has been set for a more expansive universe, particularly with the addition of others with telekinesis abilities in the second season (which I know many felt was the weakest episode of that season), I think that such could be utilized in subtle ways to help sustain the surprise elements even more.Otherwise, fantastic show and I am looking forward to more to come!"
1674,Keep the seasons coming. The only problem is there needs to be more episodes per season. Excellent!
1675,"Just go and watch the whole season with in one day.. after watching one episode, it left you with curiosity.. and you start watching next episode too..And their friendship, is soo good that inspired me a lot, and El is so cute"
1676,This review is for season 3.... the little black brat with the ultimate attitude makes this impossible to watch. All of us want to strangle her because of her mouth. The makers of this show took a great sci-fi to a politically correct soap. Get rid of her! Make this show great again!
1677,Season 3 is the best season as the viewership even proves that Season 3 is the best season being the most watched season and tbf iv watched season 3 more times than i have the other 2 seasons since it come out and im rewatching the 3rd season now completely skipping 1 and 2 its just amazing cant wait for season 4
1678,"Season 1 is a near perfect blend of nostalgia, story, and character development in a well balanced mystery adventure. 10 out of 10Season 2 had some faults centered around its structure almost all relating to expanding the universe to include the other numbered experiments. The biggest issue with this was how it was done, otherwise excising that from the show makes it pretty well done. I'd say the only other issue is that they've ramped up the danger scale to a point that will be difficult to top. 7 out of 10Season 3 is back to form. They've re centered the story on Hawkins and brought in some periphery characters into the fold. Overall well done. 8 out of 10. Personally I feel it would have been stronger keeping with the Night of the Living Dead vibe but I could see wanting to separate from the zombie trend. Most complaints about this season seem to come from a place of projection. It wild to me that people are complaining about the Russian plot-line when it'd been thrown around as a possible culprit for 2 seasons. It's the Reagan era, it's a throwback. Same goes with the complaint about it being the same enemy. Did you see the end of the last season? Other complaints from the hive mind: Violence towards women? Character's aren't supposed to be perfect. It happens. The show doesn't celebrate it, move on. Political correctness-- what? What political correctness.The biggest issue with this show is it's become wildly popular and now there's more people than ever to complain about it. Relax, the writers have a clear passion for their work. They didn't rush through it like *cough cough GOT. It's not perfect, but it almost never is. Great show. Sit back and enjoy it. Maybe skip the intro to season 2 and episode 7 of season 2 because it'll never come up again and it throws off the flow."
1679,Season 3 did not disappoint!!!! Fantastic blend of comedy and heart and sci fi!!!! Loved the never ending story song and the bond between Steve and Dustin!!! Hopper better not be dead though!!!! Can't wait for season 4!!!
1680,"The fiction in this series is unbelievable
The cast is good although they're just kids
The cinematography os amazing"
1681,"If you haven't yet heard of ""Stranger Things"", I don't know where you've been, but you better grab your remote and sit down in front of the telly right now. It's a great combination of comedy and horror although it does have it's trying moments - the overly irritating, over confident, rather stupid and for reasons unknown, toothless Dustin commands a great deal of screen time because that's how Hollywood works - the guy EVERYONE wants dead will survive through blind luck, just to irritate you to the bitter end. However the performances from the rest of the cast are worth enduring any pain Dustin's continued existence may cause. Enjoy."
1682,"Overall I thought season 3 was great!
However, it is different from the first two seasons. It follows more of the teens growing up and their relationships. I feel like this gave the characters more depth and you felt for them more. After all, they are teenagers, the show couldn't just avoid this. Also, it was nice to see them happy and having fun for once!
I did think it took a little bit too long to get to the suspense, thrill, and nerve scenes.
Still love the show!!!!"
1683,Very cool nostalgia trip to the 80's. I watch all the seasons and season 3 is the best season so far. Looking forward to the continuation.
1684,"Season 3 started a bit clunky but nicely picked up speed by E3. The only knock I really had throughout all 8 episodes was the constant bickering...you'd think by now there'd be like, ""You know what you're right. We've seen a lot of really weird ""stuff"" already, so whatever you're about to tell me, I believe you."" So putting that aside, I loved everything else. Joyce & Hopper excelled as usual and I really liked how well the on screen chemistry between Steve and Robin clicked like crazy. In fact I think Robin (Maya Hawke) absolutely owned the screen each and every time she and Steve were front and center. I was hoping they'd hook up, until Hollywood got in its own way. You can probably ""guess"" the rest. Now to the ending. It will rip your heart out...there's a loss of one of the best dudes you'll ever see in a role like the Sheriff portrayed brilliantly by David Harbour. If his demise holds (this is SciFi right?) it will be a huge hole to fill going forward. Nothing the Duffer Brothers do with the remaining time they have with this cast will equal Season One, but as long as they continue to hit homeruns with new additions like Hawke, Stranger Things will have a heckuva run."
1685,"Stranger things my favourite sci-fi horror web series .
The story starts in 1085 in Hawkins that among four friends one just disappears hence other starts looking for him and then new characters shows up with supernatural powers like this after every season new characters shows up .
This show has best direction , cast selection , locations . They have successfully showed1980's plot in the show , the vfx used on everything that looks just real .
This show is so awesome you'll fall in love after every episode.
Acting of Millie Bobby brown and David harbour is just perfect.
After watching some episodes you'll emotionally attached with series and characters. Stranger things has Perfect balance of comedy , horror , emotion , love and many more.
This series is just perfect and I'll recomend everyone to watch this series at least once."
1686,Duffer Brothers HIT it again with season 3!!! GO WATCH IT RIGHT NOW IF YOU HAVENT
1687,"If you took equal parts Half Life video game, Super 8, and Bridge to Terabithia you'd end up with Stranger Things. It's not really got enough content to stretch over 8 episodes - would have made a much tidier 2 hour movie. The kids are exactly what you expect them to be and even the most jaded viewer knows Eleven won't be allowed to hang around at the end of the series - love this poignant and sweet can never be permitted! There was a nice nod to ET with the car chase and bicycles, though with a twist to allow for Eleven's emerging powers.Characters make confusing choices (Nancy) and the main villain is never much more than a one dimensional ""government man"". Parents are, as always in kid-focused movies, CLUELESS. The main problem I think is that the Duffer brothers said ""Here are our influences.."" and proceeded to script the series, instead of digging into themselves and coming up with something more original. It's exactly what I thought it would be from the trailer, but somehow I expected more. Good soundtrack though. Also, don't be put off by Winona's inclusion - even though she gets top billing in the credits she's not the main focus - thank God."
1688,I have to tell this i haven't made any reviews yet about any series . but to be very straight forward this is first review based over series . To overall look over the series the director has made a spectacular role for every casts no were it seemed like lagging the show nailed it performance overall and gave its best all the time and in all the season . im so proud be a part of this review . im really a huge fan on over every casts and i have no words to say anything its just awesome and everybody must watch ...!! Loved the series and still in my mind . love you stranger things
1689,Never forgettable show. Loving it. waiting for season 4
1690,My all time favourite 😍 series and Millie is outstanding big fan of her and this series is one of the masterpiece love this series and Millie
1691,"This is a good show, I like horror/the supernatural, I love(d) the 80ies, it's good to see Wynona again, etc., however, as with Super 8, there is something holding me back from really being able to enjoy this: my gender. All the related/quoted movies/shows (Goonies, Super 8, It, etc.) are from a little boy's viewpoint and experience, celebrating being a boy in the 80ies, doing boy stuff with other boys. Since I am NOT a boy and I did NOT hang with boys (like Alice in Super 8) and I did not have brothers or sons in the 80ies either, I cannot fully relate/identify myself with the nostalgia/ image being shown (and don't get started about that weird girl ""11"", no identification possible/desirable here, either). If I think about what I expected during the 80ies to happen for women and feminism in the future, I am aghast. The situation for women over the last years rather has deteriorated than improved. And hearing African American men complaining about Hollywood/the Academy - they should trying to be a (any) woman!! Kit Harrington being offended that he is slightly reduced to his looks?? Is he for real? Has he been in a coma from his birth on not to realize what it is (still) like for women (in Hollywood and elsewhere)? We are still being heavily discriminated (and offended), not treated (and paid) equal, seen as prey, treated careless (or even violent), being reduced/objectified, not allowed the same things, etc. etc. I know it will never change, and this is just a minor example, but it still IS rude and careless of producers and writers to shut girls out like this and not caring if a program is okay for them, too. I do NOT want to be reduced to love stories (hate it), Grey's Anatomy (hate it) etc. - I want to be considered for any other non-feminine-clichéd genre as well. But as I said: I know, it's never gonna happen, if it didn't happen in the 80ies, it will surely not happen in this reactionary millennium - you women out there know what I am talking about, you go along with the stream like dead fish, feminism is dead."
1692,"I've heard this show was good from many different people so I thought hey, why not give it a try. Well unfortunately it wasn't very thrilling or entertaining to me. First off, it's sooooo slow. It feels like a drag and it didn't capture my interest. Secondly, it's weird. Very very weird. The title definitely fits the show but not in a good way in my opinion. It's a show that people will like if you enjoy bizarre elements & a slow plot based TV Show. Neither I like so I'm giving this a 5 because it had its moments of good cinematography & suspense. But boring scenes, plot, & characters often drag all that hype down so to me, it's meh. 5/10 wouldn't recommend unless you're super bored."
1693,"For me Stranger Things ticks every box. Great acting, great filming, a nostalgic glimpse back at my childhood, great soundtrack, superb acting and excellent directing. It is without doubt my favourite ever TV show. It has turned me into a geek; buying mugs and t-shirts, watching outtakes and behind the scenes clips and trawling for any info on the next series. It is an obsession! Love it."
1694,"Good series, very interesting and good to watch. good story line, they use the characters well. next season will be exciting to watch. left last series with a major cliffhanger"
1695,Idk what to say to that. i dig it. Especially Millie Bobby Brown is a great actress. I guess she will be a new Natalie Portman.
1696,"Well, at least the character development was slightly better than season 2. But you can basically watch the first episode then skip ahead to episode 7 and you haven't really missed anything. It just drags along aimlessly. They should really shorten the seasons or come up with new plots. It's getting like the Star Wars sequels in its bland repetitiveness. Maybe changing cities next season will add life to a show that's always been overrated for nostalgia reasons."
1697,"There is no comparing this to other shows. It is hands down the best. Most entertaining, most suspenseful and best acting. You can't not binge watch the crap out of this."
1698,"The closest thing I'll ever get to reliving my 1980's childhood. Superbly written, casted, located, directed and shot. The attention to detail in set design, wardrobe, make up and soundtrack is incredible. The CGI is also fantastic. One of the rare titles to get the full 10 from me!!"
1699,Overall the new season was better than the formers in terms of suspense and hangups. But the ending somehow felt the same as that of S2. There are no new revelations about the plot talking about the Russians and why they opened the gate again. The ending was a bit disappointing.
1700,"On a conceptual level this series doesn't sound like anything special. It's basically like Poltergeist or It where some sort of mysterious force caused a kid to go missing and now the other characters have to go through scary situations to figure out what happened. 44-minute Episodes are also a little long for me. However now that the negatives are out of the way let's talk about what makes the series good. The biggest strength of the series is easily with the atmosphere. It can get really intense and perfectly captures that scary feeling, or even with how the background music connects to what is happening in the story. There is also the fact that it's set in the 1980s, so all the sets are built to give off that kind of vibe. So overall the settings are great, but what about the mystery itself? While it has been played out before (at least on a conceptual level), how the story is built is that each episode would uncover a little more about the possible forces that caused the boy to go missing. The characters are also pretty good with the most standout for me being the kid with telekinetic powers who doesn't talk until a few episodes in, 011. The series also shows how the mystery would affect the characters and all the weird things that would happen (the most notable for me would be when the 3 yr old is walking through the hallway and the lights turn on and off.) The mom gives off a vibe where she's comparable to Kevin's mom from the Home Alone movies where she's determined to find her son and make sure he's all right, even if it means fighting with people you probably shouldn't fight with. This story in general could also be semi-relatable to some parents (minus all the supernatural elements.) As parents you never want something like this to happen to your kids and you fear what would happen to them if it did.
As of this original review, I have only watched the first season. As I watch more of it I will keep you and the review updated."
1701,"Hint of childish humor to give us that 90's nostalgic feeling.The Duffer brothers give u crumbs to follow as they throw basic road blocks in front of their characters for them to find creative and yet believable ways to solve them.A feel good trip. With some peril amidstThe show takes u on a high risk quick paced journey. With each lovable character in the frontlines of a war, having to depend on each other, sometimes without even knowing.The pace remains the same till it hits its explosive epic finale. Where it slows down to give a respectful goodbye to the fallen. And to us the audience who no doubt cannot wait for STRANGER THINGS 4.9.8 out of 10 ""Satans Baby Fireworks"" fireworks."
1702,"What's with all that hysterical screaming ? I mean seriously, there's no horror movie without that, but here it seems like frenzied shouting is the only way characters are allowed to communicate. Wynona is overacting so badly it seems anything, literally any movement or sound will trigger her and it does. The same applies to majority of others.
There are so many ways to create suspense in a movie (Twin Peaks is a good example) but in Stranger things screaming in terror is the only one.
Oh, and the musical score is really random."
1703,"I was not alive in the 80s nor have I been to middle or high school (I'm home-schooled) but this film mixes up the worst things films like E.T. and It have to offer. All the children and teenagers in there are mean, impolite, rebellious, dishonest, cold or above all. It also shows unnecessary partial nudity between teenagers and disrespectful teasing such as pushing each other or teasing verbally. Every time Nancy came onto the screen, I would cringe and wish that her parents would come in and spank her. She is cold to her family and she may not be entirely selfish but when Barb disappeared, all she worried about was her and nothing else. It also has bullying in there. Therefore, all the kids in this series are stereotypical. No one in there is solid, compelling or likeable. They are all weak.It also has too much crying in there, especially from Joyce, I know she's a mother and it makes sense she's worried about her lost child but she is always freaking out and crying and it's too annoying to bear.Shame that this had some good ideas such as plot and Eleven's superpowers but they were executed poorly. It was also too confusing. I heard a lot of people say good things about this series and it looked interesting to watch but I find this overrated. I dropped this after episode 4. I don't recommend this, unless you want to get annoyed by unlikeable, jerkish kids."
1704,"This is a very good, entertaining show. With that being said it is a tad bit overrated. I'll start with the positives, the acting is all very good, especially from the kids. We all know what Winona Ryder and David Harbour can do. However, much of this show rides on its young cast of preteen and teenage children. All of whom are very inexperienced, but they all do a tremendous job. The story is interesting and keeps you engaged, but there is a ton of plot elements missing and plenty of holes. For example, I am still not really sure what the ""Upside Down"" is, what was done to open it; What happened to any other victims of the Demagorgan; if the Demagorgan is attracted to blood, shouldn't it be killing more people; why did Will not die when he was captured by the Demagorgan, but Barb did? That is just to name a few. I thought much more would be expanded on in the second season, but many of the questions I have from season 1 are still present. It seemed like the writers almost made up rules as they went along. I think it is too complex of a story to try and tell for its target audience. That's not to say it's for ""stupid"" people, but its clearly not a show that tries to get you to think super hard, and it gives a plot with a ton of information that should be provided. A lot of the twists are rather predictable, and hardly any important characters meet any type of tragic end. I know super fans hate deaths, but I think it strengthens the show when writers are able to muster up the courage to kill an important character (ask the writers of GoT). Again, I don't mean to criticize the show, but the majority of reviews on here are positive, and I think it's important to point out some of the negatives. Overall, its a fun show, great acting, good characters, fun story (with some blemishes)."
1705,"Combination of 1976 Movie Carrie, the Video Game Series Half Life 1998 to 2004, and Movie The Mist 2007 (Thumbs down recent Millenial's attempt as TV Series The Mist, slow paced drama).Anybody that was a Tween to Teen during the 1980s will appreciate Stranger Things, especially the music of Season 2.Those Tween years everybody had awkward boy girl relationships at ""Middle School"" as puberty starts. Many made the wrong decisions at the wrong time. Created Rules for their Adolescent cliques.Tween Disdain of their Parents has not started. Their Tween relationship with their Parents is cordial and not strained like High School aged Teens that will be ""Adults"" soon.Usually the older Brother or Sister is tasked with ""Baby Sitting"" and as a High School Student or recent High School Graduate gives really limited experience advise about the Opposite Sex, Dating, Relationships, Sex, to their younger siblings.The Question the Audience must ask is if there will be Stranger Things 3."
1706,"I had no idea what i was getting myself into. I am not used to the 80s horror genre, but I felt like I was thrown back in time.I do not know if this was directed to a 10 year old or a 40 year old. Some brief moments of great acting and clever turns really captured me and made me into the biggest fan of this show ever, but then i was quickly disappointed by the immature lines that was given to some actors which made me sigh louder than I did to my middle school teacher that told stories to us kids like we were 5 years old. I also felt like I have already seen too many movies with the same concept with travel between different dimensions. So it felt like the creators have watched too many of the same movies as I and copied what other dimensions is like. Please make something that is new.I rate this show to a 6/10. Just the poor lines and lack of originality lowers this score by 2 points."
1707,"get up, come on get down with the table get up, come on get down with the dickness get up, come on get down with my penis open up your mouth and let me give it to yoooooooouAside from that, this show is absolutely f*cking amazing. If you do not watch this show, you are not alive. The acting is top-notch, the theme is great, and if you have sex while watching this show, you'll probably focus on the show moreso than the sex. It's amazing. Watch it."
1708,"First of all, I rarely write reviews and even then it has to be a special occasion. So, few months ago when the show started becoming mainstream and getting overwhelming praise and attention I finally decided to give it a shot. At first it started off being rather intriguing and definitely demonstrated that there was potential, but unfortunately, it just never picked up or delivered truth be told. After the pilot the plot just started floating around going back and forth until the very disappointing finale that just left me wanting.........nothing. That's it. There wasn't enough suspense to fully immerse me or to hook me at the very least. I found the characters generic and unconvincing. Especially, the missing boy's mother who just out of desperation and anxiety becomes obnoxiously unstable for no reason. If she wanted to convince people that her son's disappearance was ambiguous and it was more to it, acting delusional wasn't gonna help it one bit. I'm not gonna get deep into the plot, I just noted that because I found her character extremely irritating. Now, before I go on, the fact that insignificant character such as Barb, who barely had any screen time got so much media exposure resulting the actress attending talk shows (no offense to the person who played the character.) just proves that something isn't right. At least half of the praise comes from the show being some kind of ""homage"" to the 80's and the horror directors from that time, but honestly, where was the homage? just because the show is presumably set in the 80's and we frequently see prominent cultural things from that period doesn't mean squat. 80's/90's horror films had a lot more going on and had wider plot not to mention the payoff. Plus, they were memorable. On the other hand, there was absolutely nothing memorable about this show. Boring characters with zero unique traits. But yet again, this is a show in which a girl with psychic powers who barely talks or does anything and a teenager who tells her friend not to go to some party with her boyfriend are the most popular characters. The atmosphere in this show was there, but we never got to look at it since 95% of this show is about the main cast of kids talking or the obnoxious mother trying to establish communication with her missing son. There's the Sheriff who seemed more interesting than the rest of the cast but his character of course doesn't go anywhere either. Honestly, it's not a bad show, but it's nothing special. There's nothing that will make you want more. I'm not even gonna talk about the awful payoff with a cheap looking CGI ""monster"" and those ""evil government"" agents who are just there to either be a threat or a reference to E.T. The entire plot was paper thin and just felt like another above average episode of X-files. It had enormous potential with the set up, but that's all there is to it. It's a shallow plot in a really good format. And regardless of all of my criticism that might come off negative, I'm giving the show a 7/10. My assessment was to state that there's nothing special or unique about this show, not that it's BAD or anything. Extremely overrated reception that parades this show as the next Twin Peaks is the only reason it's getting so much attention. A Snowball Effect of hype. Sadly, that's how most things work now days. I didn't bother getting deeply into the plot because that's what ""fans"" of this show do, I'm not a fan, I'm a viewer making a concise statement. I suggest you watch the show yourself and based on your standards you might come to the same conclusion. It's not a bad show, just nothing special. But it could have been."
1709,"This show is amazing.Just finished watching it about an hour ago. This is amazing. seriously. It's a thriller and a horror show, but also funny, brings happiness, and DEM FEELS!!! Seriously, if you have doubt, give this a try! I thought it's pretty overrated because everyone was talking about this. And I gave it a try, and its amazing! I love the tone, the writing is SPECTACULAR!This show is an amazing early 80s throwback, the screenplay and actors do an amazing job of conveying a sense of the time with references and feel in the show. and the performance!I usually don't expect much from kid actors but all of the child actors here were amazing. Seriously, go watch it"
1710,"If i could give 20 stars I would. So many characters deserve awards especially Eleven - Millie Bobby Brown. Every time I thought I knew what was going to happen, the story would take a different turn. It falls into the awesome category between Horror and Drama. I heard reviews before I watched but nothing could prepare me for what I just witness. We watched the entire season in less then 24 hours. It reminded me of a great book that you just can't put down. If you are second guessing yourself about watching it. DON'T you will not be disappointed. I have to admit we are about bunch of horror junkies and that's how we began to watch. But I can't even put it in that category alone. Its been a long time since a series has actually caught me and pulled me in. I felt like I was there with every character, every step of the way. We can't wait for season 2. The ending definitely surprised us all. KEEP UP the great work."
1711,"Disappointing. Weak plot and no emphasis on details.Although the main poster gives a precise hint on the spirit of the series, I did not expect that it would be just a mixture of references to classical horror or Sci-Fi movies and the series would not have its unique features.Four kids and their journey, strongly resembled the movie ""Stand by Me"", but unlike their counterparts from 1986 classic, kids in this series did not create meaningful characters, huge nod to their acting talents though. The plot was too stereotypical and one could easily guess what would happen next. For example, finding Will Byers with animal's tentacle in his mouth rang ""Alien"" bells too loudly, while showing Yoda toy to Eleven automatically meant that she could do the same as the Jedi master. By the way, why was she called ""Eleven"" when apparently she was the first of her kind?! Just to be able to shorten her name till ""Ives""? Not funny.In addition, there were inconsistencies in the plot and details were treated careless. For example, Eleven did not even know the meaning of the word ""friend"" but she knew what kissing in the lips meant and how automatic sliding doors work. Also Will's mother was not happy at first that his son wanted to see ""Poltergeist"", but ""The Thing"" poster revealed that the kids have already watched scarier movies in the past. Besides, lighting up Christmas tree light bulbs one by one? ""That is not how the Force works!"" And the last but not least — who will cut his/her hand before fighting a monster?! No rational person, nobody!Talking about the monster, the Demogorgon, SFXs were cheap like the way used to kill the monster. ""Deus ex Machina"" moment and the sacrifice of the main character is not the final of the season deserves. Although it was a good reference to the final of ""The Matrix Revolutions"", anyway it was reference to the bad ending taking into account that Hopper and waffle scene hinted Eleven is still alive.In short, screenplay for the first season was too weak but there is still hope."
1712,"Only saw the first episode and was floored. Had to review this! Story is awesome and the characters are freaking good. I mean for everyone that has watched anything they know how bad child actors are from the Walking Dead to the strain and basically every other show where there is a child actor... not here, i mean, they were freaking awesome. It is been so long with Carls and Maxes and whatever other **** child actors.Then there are the the props and direction, it is like watching a genuine freaking 80s stuff.so freaking good! max thumbs, tomatoes, freshness, whatever! bye"
1713,"It's okay. We've seen similar premises with Firestarter, Scanners, Minority Report, etc. I binged watched and enjoyed..... however.....every time the three boys came on screen I cringed. Every single scene was them arguing, yelling at each other, shoving each other, insulting each other, over and over and over. No development beyond that. Like whoever wrote those scenes only knew about preteens from watching Goonies. Loved Wynona Ryder and the Police Chief guy. I did enjoy the retro 80s feel of the show. It actually seems like it was made in 1983 at times, and in a good way. Quite honestly if it hadn't been for the bickering kids and teen angst I would have give it 8 stars, but they bothered me that much. Hasn't matched the hype for me but obviously, I'm in the minority with that opinion."
1714,"OF Watchers;ET ,Goonies,and a bunch of others. I liked the 80s nostalgia they did a good job there..It's refreshing to see a series/movie without everyone hammering away on their apple computer,or talking on their cell phones. A lot of people complain that they getting beaten over the head with the 80s nostalgia.Either they aren't from the 80s,or they missed the part, about it all taking place in the 80s.It's very E.T if E.T was written by Stephen King.Think The watchers, combined with E.T,in human form.The younger kids does and excellent job of portraying 80s kids behavior. Now they might not have it completely nailed,but close enough.Considering it decades before they were ever born. The older kids thought, they fall into the stereotype you often see in every teen movie.Either by bad directing,bad script,or a combination. So nothing really new or impressive there.Winona ryder was good as hysterical mom.She really looked like a mental patientWhat annoyed me the most with the series,was all the stuff that takes place in pitch black darkness, so you don't see a thing.And just have to guess what's going on, based on screams and grunting and shuffling. And don't get me started on all the flashbacks. Telling story in flashbacks,have become so popular these days. It's just a really lazy way of trying to progress the story, most of the times it doesn't work. They could have saved the flashback until the end,when they wrap it all up.All in all I give this 4 for the nostalgia"
1715,"Most American TV shows are garbage. Most are devoid of any sign that an intelligent person actually worked on them, and more often than not most have some serious racist undertones that would keep me from ever recommending them to vulnerable young minds. Then there's this so, which so far has managed to show young people as intelligent, interesting creatures. And the best part is that it's fun and smart without the constant stereotype underpinning usually found in American shows."
1716,"Right from the beginning it's obviously set in the 80s. My first thought was E.T. for some reason. Aliens also came to mind. I have yet to continue the season but so far, it's a good choice if you're an 80s retro fan. I gave a 6/10 but that may change. The other episodes will determine my rate changes. Winona Ryder so far is likable as a mother. There were some strange things happening alright. I guess by continuing you'll come across stranger things. Law enforcement is introduced with their typical Monday morning mood. The Chief of police is introduced as a conceited figure of authority, an attitude I'm sure many have seen in resemblance to other films or programs set in the same era. It should make for an interesting plot."
1717,"Season 1 , 2 , 3 totally brilliant, great and no words to say about this series .
Awaiting for season 4 ....."
1718,"Spectacular show , it's one of the favorite and Netflix best till date. Desperately waiting for season 4."
1719,Season 3 took this amazing series to a new level. Full on action but balanced perfectly with humour and emotion. Masterpiece.
1720,This series so good and I cant wait for season 4. I hope hopper still live
1721,"This season had a mixture of mystery, love, comedy, horror and heartbreaking moments. It didn't suffer from pacing like last season, but all episodes were equally engaging and interesting. It was truly something new despite the main threat being the same, The Mind Flayer. I loved the characters, the 80's reference, the storytelling and the acting was so impressive, what a talented group. It also had a very satisfying end, with a hint left for speculation to what's next. I do have some minor criticism though, I would like to know more about the Russians motivation for dealing with the gate. They did come off as one dimension villain type of characters, perhaps that'll be explored in season 4. Also I wish they'd tone down Erica a bit going forward. Despite her character being extremely entertaining and fun to watch, there were moments I felt they overdid it.
Billy was amazing, what an awesome redemption arc to a character that was such a douche in the previous season. Also the visuals are insanely beautiful, pretty spectacular for a TV show, def Movie level. And I'm so happy El is dating Mike, what a cute heartwarming love story. The kids are hilarious!
Now we will all be wondering...
Will Eleven get her powers back and how? Is Hopper ""The American""? Will the next story take place back in Hawkins? How will the group reunite again? Can they ever defeat the threat in the Upside Down?"
1722,"There are a lot of attributes that can make a show entertaining. There's production design, cinematography, soundtrack, acting, directing, and the story itself. Stranger Things more or less has all of this, but above all, it also has amazing character development.Right off the first episode, the show maximizes your time with every character so that they are as likable as possible. Even with Will Byers, a kid who gets lost after the first eight minutes of the show, you can't help but love the kid after he's gone.Though I think Stranger Things overall has all the attributes of a great show, I do see certain aspects fade as the episodes go on. There will be times where pacing is all over the place, and times where the story is stretched among all characters - especially the third season. However, because I love the characters so much, I don't care what else happens. I can watch a season of the kids just sitting around in a basement and still be entertained - they are all just so likable.I give the show a 9/10, and regardless of how the show continues, it will stay at that bar - that's the advantages of great characters. It doesn't matter what they do, I just want more!"
1723,"Witty, fast paced, great 80's nods & a cliff hanger which will keep me coming back for more. Well done!"
1724,"STRANGER THINGS SEASON 3 REVIEWA superb eight-hour Action-Adventure-Horror-Comedy-Drama-Suspense ride, the best Season so far of the series. I liked the way they broke the cast down into several smaller teams that go on their own adventure, and then have all of them come together later in the series.It allowed more dynamism and more character development, like Wynona Ryder got to show everyone again how charismatic she can be onscreen. A Must See, I'm looking forward to Season 4 and the mystery of ""The American"" on the Kamchatka Peninsula."
1725,"Worth the wait! A little too many pointless fillers, but great season finished it in 2 days. The cast really gave it their all and I cried at the end!"
1726,"When I first saw the trailer 2 years back, I didn't realise is going to give a sheer of joy. Later, after I finished the first season, the first thing that I felt was why it is finished so soon and felt the same for season 2 and 3 as well.This series is bestest of all time - Interesting, riveting, mind blowing, laughter, awkward, gloomy, hilarious, affable, adorable, and love. What more can I ask from a TV series and I just hope this series continues atleast till 7 ."
1727,"To me this movie has anything you need to keep you alert, on toes, interested... It has a funny moments, non sleeping action, the game of all actors is incredible! I really dont understand why the 3rd season is so lowly rated, but to me thats incorrect! The whole 3 seasons have 10!"
1728,"I had to stop watching this because it got so dark! Everything about it got so dark. I am really disappointed in the past two seasons. It went from good, to bad, to awful."
1729,"Stranger things, season after season keeps proving its self and raises the bar even more !!! Netflix's masterpiece.. Season 3 topped the 80s game even more allowing each character to have his/her role in the story. Great acting from each one of them! One of the rare shows that gets better by the second! Never boring or filled.. (except for El's sister episode which i personally liked)"
1730,I wouldn't want to give out the fun all I can say its a journey!
1731,I really enjoyed season 3. The kids being more grown connected better with me and I loved all the 80s kickbacks. Cant wait for season 4.
1732,"I have to say I do like the show... original and since I grew up in the 80's, love the music. But what I'm ticked off about is the third season is just riddled with cursing and not stop cussing. This show would be just as good without all the foul language. First two seasons weren't bad but Crikey, third season is none stop language. Way to go Hollywood! You just couldn't refrain from shoving the language down our throats..."
1733,"The acting by these young folk is very impressive plus all the amazing special effects done, the plot is pure gold and it's just such a good show with the best ships ever, plus a eerie creepy feel, and a bit of comedy, it's literally a show for everyone, it has everything. I love it, millions of people love it, and soon enough, you'll love it. Watch it if you want to be happy :)"
1734,"Hoppers behavior made this hard to watch. I love this show with my whole heart. The actors are amazing! I am studying to become a Marriage and relationship therapist. To see behavior like this makes me so angry. To see Nancy get treated like that made me angry. Nobody. Male, female, animal should be treated that way. I wanted to slap him so friggen hard."
1735,Best show on 'TV' at the moment. I love the 80s and this is such a throwback.
1736,"Season 3 fixes all the issues of second part of season one. Also all of season 2... fast. To the point. These 8 episodes waist no time.. only issue is I was that age doing everything they do .. just never cussed that... or my friends.. had many of quest.. many campaigns... if the language was just down a bit...and some enundo would, I would not have any problem of my 7 ...lol... yes 7... children watching... see the 80s for what they were which this show very well... not political, but just how beautiful it was then..."
1737,"Everything has led up to this big trilogy and even though it ends the only way it could, it could have simply omitted the end credits sequence. I went back and put on S1 as a comparison because I was thinking my TV had dead pixels all of the sudden, but nope... there is some serious artifacts during many of the later scenes in the show, which frankly is puzzling. A lot of them must have been the camera itself. S1 visually somehow looked better...which is confusing. I think creatively S3 is just as good as S1 but some visual flair was lost probably due to the immense CG FX required at nearly all times in certain scenes. You have to film scenes a certain way in order to have the visual FX team do their best but it didn't fit the original style of the show. Now... of course the show steps up the action, big time... and it stepped up the consequences. There NEEDED to be BIG consequences and there was. There was a sense of dread in S3 missing from S2, which by far was the weakest even though it had it's pivotal scenes with Eleven. I felt some of the pacing/editing could have been altered before the BIG climax but that's just a personal choice. I loved the Never Ending story reference which does have meaning to the show. They might be telling us the story will never end because someone else is going to always try to get to the upside down, many of which didn't figure out with their hate of that moment. They are too young to have witnessed a childhood classic. What happens in the actual Climax is brutal and unforgiving to the trilogy and I'm so glad some sequence didn't comeback to show us something REALLY stupid, which it didn't. The consequences of the town were unreal and really disturbing. Loved it.
I'm hoping the trilogy is all they are going to do because it ""should"" end on this note. The heart to heart ending was both sad and uplifting at the same time. Billy was awesome as usual. How some people could think this has turned into some comedy/drama confuses the hell out of me to be honest. It felt the most brutal on honest episode."
1738,"If you somehow think ""Back to the Future"" movies and series represents the height of storytelling and think American horror flics from the eighties are ""cool"" then this will be entertaining. Maybe you will feel that way if you were born in the eighties like the Duffer brothers.On the other hand, if you put any demands on TV-shows also of this type, then you're wasting your time. I just wasted it for nine episodes in the hope of some nice twists. What utter boring old crap this series is made of. The logical wasteland that is the story and the one-dimensional storytelling and acting will bore you. You could put a supertanker in the plot holes which is exasperating considering the high quality of TV-scripts these days. This kind of thing only could fly in the eighties and while Stranger Things is grounded in the eighties, it's not a very entertaining asoect to adopt also the stupid antics from that era. Stranger Things could have been great, but it's so small minded it's downright painful.The acting overall is barely acceptable. Not the worst I've seen and most actors do what they can with this weak material I guess.Winona makes a somewhat convincing mother and David Harbour has presence most of the time. The boys Finn, Caleb and Gaten, well I guess they're doing OK. The only one that stands out though is Millie Bobby Brown that manages to have charisma and mystique just by being there on screen. She's hardly worth going trough all the episodes for, but her performance should be noted. She can't save the story though. Waste your time on this at your own peril and make sure to check your brain at the door!"
1739,This tv show is fabulous. This is the best show I have ever seen.
1740,"Must watch series. Trust me , u will feel very happy after watching this series."
1741,You must watch especially 3th season. Game of thrones was frustration. Emmy absolutely goes to StrangerThings3. wonderful
1742,"I thought the kids were phony, Winona Ryder was annoying, Matthew Modine was comatose and the plot was hackneyed.But the ""best"" part was the special effects that looked as if a dollar store exploded. I have done better special effects in my basement.What am I missing about the merits of this weak effort?"
1743,"Don't believe the haters lol, this season have been the season by far. just go watch it by yourself. the rollercoaster are woahh..."
1744,Idk what's so special about this cringey show. A total snoozefest.
1745,"The first episode is rather good, plenty of good ideas but every epodode being worse than the previous, at the end of season 1 you've already got severe inconsistencies in the scenario and character behaviours, too much predictability and too many clichés. Season 2 is bad on all levels and episode 1 of season 3 is sickeningly terrible."
1746,What a show presented by Netflix and directed by The Duffer Brothers just mind blowing and the last episode of season 3 you will cry you will laugh what a amazing concept man brilliant after watching this type show on Netflix you would defiinetly know why Netflix is expensive cause it deserve it.
1747,"Every episode just awesome, because of eleven they can win all battle."
1748,"Stranger things is one of the best shows there is, and you can't deny that. there's comedy, a great storyline, lovable and funny characters, great soundtracks and a lot of 80s nostalgia.i watched the first two seasons two years ago, and i was so hooked i watched them in two days. when season three came out in july, i woke up earlier just to watch it (it's my favorite show and i'm just a 13 year old fan girl). it's so captivating! the storyline is great, maybe not as good in s3 as it was in the first 2 seasons but still amazing.the cast has really talented actors, all of them are. but, personally, i think millie bobby brown (eleven), noah schnapp (will) and winona ryder (joyce) 's performances are emmy-deserving. millie was nominated twice but i really think she deserves a win for season 3, i mean, have you seen those fighting scenes?! they gave me chills. noah's talent is quite overlooked this last season, considering he didn't do much. but his performance in season 2 is absolutely mindblowing. the boy nailed it.if you're looking for something good and captivating to watch, go stream stranger things! i absolutely recommend it if you like shows with great storylines, good music and some funny moments :)"
1749,This show is one for the record books. It's awesome and its 80's take is freaking awesome. A show I can watch a thousand times and never get tired of it.
1750,The Duffer Brothers have made a master piece of a show. They hired amazing and talented actors who played the roles almost making you forget it's a show. You build a bond for the actors and get torn apart when something bad happens then ecstatic when something positive occurs. Without boring you this show is a MUST WATCH 100%. So far I have watched the show 12 times and season 3 22 times. So yep it's amazing.Lastly great job Duffer Brothers and Stranger Things crew especially Millie Bobby Brown. You killed playing El!
1751,Not too many times can you actually really feel the setting in a certain time period but stranger things does a amazing job of this even with the smallest of details. The storyline is very suspenseful without taking away from key elements like character relationships whom very fast you grow strong opinions of. Overall it is definitely worth watching every minute of you won't be sorry.
1752,"I am pleased that Netflix keeps on making great series like this one, with very good actors like Rider and Modine. I am watching season one and cannot get enough of it. It is intriguing and great photography."
1753,So I've been watching for three days now and I'm already on season 3 it's so addicting I would recommend to anyone. I'm more of a chill and funny person. Watching the office and stuff like that. My friends all started to watch it so I decided ti watch it also. And I'm not disappointed. It's one of the best shows ever
1754,"Because everyone is hyped about ST I watched the first episode... and hated it. a few months later I watched the second episode. It was ok. And now I ended up bingewatching all 3 seasons and calling stranger things the best thing ever happend!!!
I feel like it gets better with every episode.
Ps: im in love with Billy.. please send help"
1755,"Season 3 is not the best, but it's really not all that bad either. Season 3 had a marvel-like style to it which should have bothered me because for the most part I hate the pretense in marvel. So season 3 has that but the strong characters, pulled off by some seriously outstanding young talent, continue to give this show serious credibility. These kids pour their heart and soul into every scene, every line. I rarely see this cohesion among a cast anymore. It is wonderful to see. What can I say about Winona Ryder other than that she fits this show like a glove - wonderful casting. Can't wait for season 4."
1756,Stranger things is one of the best season that I have ever watched. All characters are awesome . Soundtracks of all three seasons are damn good . But of season three is very emotional . I hope that there will season fourth comes next year. Netflix has made a master class season.
1757,"Just wow.... Looks like a normal 80s movie but with a big twist of scfi, horror, godzilla excitement even.Even amount of scenes... Love, thriller, horror, action not toooo repetitive.... Well done!"
1758,Really Bad cinematography when it's get dark.. can't see anything... except that everything is oke .. good plot
1759,"The 10/10 is for Seasons 1 and 2 which are just pure Magic and makes Stranger Things one of the best TV Shows ever made. Especially Season 1 is worth the watch for pretty much anyone with fantastic manuscript, incredible actors and a very good story, all set in a well executed 80's setting with loads of references to current phenomenons such as Stephen King, D&D, Arcade Games, Star Wars and others.Season 2 is also a brilliant season with lots of suspence, great new characters and yet another fantastic experience. Sean Astin does a super performance and the only downside is epsiode 7 which is just out of place and could have been left out entirely. If you liked season 1, definitely watch the amazin season 2!I just finished watching Season 3 which doesn't come close to the previos seasons due to a manuscript that is just nonsense most of the time with loads of childish dialogue, and creating a parody of itself which is too bad for such an excellent show. Season 3 does however end on a high note with the last episode of the season being the absolute strongest and gives hope for any future seasons :-)"
1760,Its such an amazing show loved every minute of it. Can't wait for season 4
1761,"Review RundownThe latest installment of the Netflix smash hit has finally arrived, further asserting directors/writers Scott and Ross Duffer as some of the most masterful storytellers working today. Stranger Things 3's remarkable success mostly stems from building on established lore as well as successfully introducing new faces into the rich world of 1980s Hawkins Indiana. Its distinct, colorful look fully immerses the viewer into this small midwestern town with breathtaking visuals utilizing a large dose of practical effects with some computer-generated imagery. Millie Bobby Brown once again shines giving another brilliant performance as Eleven. The rest of the returning cast deliver masterful performances as well, further building on their respective characters and their evolving relationships. However, Stranger Things 3's lasting impact is emphasized in an emotionally resounding finale packed with heart, gritty action, unexpected twists and turns, all culminating into perhaps, one of the all-time best hours of television.Read more film and television reviews at: pablofilmreviews.comFull review:Three years and two successful seasons after the pop culture phenomenon initially hit households around the world, Stranger Things seeks to once again serenade audiences with its unique 80s charm and iconic characters. This time around, our protagonists face their greatest challenge as they try and partake in traditional summer festivities. While viewers could be turned off to the seemingly formulaic approach to each season, Matt and Ross Duffer once again prove their ""formula"" not only works but feels fresh, new and epic on every installment. Stranger Things 3 not only succeeds as a standalone season of great television but at its core it serves as a necessary evolution to what its audience is already familiar with.Creators Matt and Ross Duffer accomplish this by mixing in new elements while expanding on established lore without losing its familiar feel. Characters Billy and Max, whose impact in Stranger Things 2 felt minimal are majorly developed with Sadie Sink and especially Dacre Montgomery giving excellent performances. Sadie Sink's Max is allowed to do much more along with Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) who also becomes a season favorite with a delightful romantic dynamic between the two. Maya Hawke, newcomer into the series, brings an interesting new dynamic working off Joe Keery's character Steve with Priah Ferguson (playing Erica Sinclair), adding some levity that at times felt over the top but mostly succeeded. New additions to this season also include the Starcourt Mall which reaks personality with its colorful and detailed design adding to the show's vibrant aesthetic. Stranger Things 3's vibrant look cannot go understated, shots are beautifully composed with colors popping off the screen left and right not only giving it a distinct look but making it a treat to watch.However, the show's bread and butter still lies beyond its visual appeal, mainly leaning on its extremely likable characters and charismatic cast. Millie Bobby Brown is better than ever as Eleven delivering another brilliant performance as the super-powered youngster struggles to find herself while balancing a romantic as well as father-daughter relationship. Eleven's fish out of water dynamic while lessened is still present and accounts for several strong comedic moments that don't feel overplayed or stale. Played by David Harbour, Jim Hopper and his struggles in fatherhood develop into a focal point in Stranger Things 3 quickly becoming one of the most enjoyable aspects of the season both in its comedic and dramatic aspects. His and Winona Ryder's chemistry (playing Joyce Byers) is still one of the highlights as Joyce struggles to move on from her past tragic relationship.Furthermore, the rest of our favorite geeky friends' struggles are not lost in the shuffle and still have satisfying payoffs. Dustin's (played by Gaten Matarazzo) relationship with Steve is further explored as he struggles to fit back in after being out of town for a month. Similar to Dustin, Will (played by Noah Schnapp) finds rejoining the group tougher than he expected becoming more and more nostalgic for ""the good old days."" Mike's (played by Finn Wolfhard) relationship with Eleven takes a step forward from previous seasons until his and Hopper's overprotective nature starts to negatively affect the relationship. Meanwhile, Jonathan and Nancy continue their journey into adulthood both now working in the Hawkins Post quickly realizing the hardships of the real world.This is where the heart of Stranger Things lies, its realistic and relatable portrayal of its main characters and their relationships set to a whimsy fantastical backdrop. Nowhere is this better exemplified than how it handles the younger kids in the show. Unlike most shows, the audience's investment in the kids does not rely on the cuteness factor. Stranger Things 3's fantastic writing makes watching these kids interact, grow, and evolve just as engaging as the more scary and dramatic elements of the show. However, even with how grounded our main character are in certain ways, Stranger Things 3 does require some suspension of disbelief for the more fantastical elements that are developed throughout the season and how they are dealt with. Subplots involving evil Russians also border on a sort of 80s cheesiness that while gives the show its identity, could fail to connect with audiences.Nevertheless, Stranger Things 3 delivers on these same scary and dramatic elements the audience has come to expect with some of the most terrifying as well as goriest sequences in the whole series. In both the dramatic and more subtle sequences, the action is accompanied by what can only be described as an additional presence on screen. Kyle Dixon along with Michael Stein once again provide an essential aspect to the season with a powerful, very distinct score that never overshadows the action but instead takes it to new heights.Stranger Things 3's slow build-up allows the audience to catch up with our main characters while at the same time slowly but seamlessly transitioning giving little hints of the bigger picture and what's to come. The slow build up comes to a sort of payoff in episode 4 were most of the action kicks off with a jaw dropping finale foreshadowing what is yet to come. However, Stranger Things 3's lasting impact lies in its ability to finish strong in a gripping finale. Filled with laughs, drama, gruesome action, suspense, and most of all: heartfelt emotion, Episode eight of Stranger Things 3 proves to be one of the most compelling and powerful hours of television released in the last few years. Stranger Things once again shows the power of brilliant storytelling. Its incredible writing heightens the audience's investment beyond superficial and abstract elements and into just a deep love for the world Scott and Ross Duffer have created. Fantastic performances, gorgeous visuals and marvellous writing all-around, push the emotion beyond the screen as the twin filmmakers from North Carolina remind the world that Stranger Things is still here, and it's here to stay."
1762,"I'm 32 years old and watching this made me feel like a kid again. A complete breath of fresh air. Pure fuel for me.
Judging by the quality of acting, I'd say youth today is totally underrated. The story of the adventurous kids and heroic Jim Hopper fighting the evil is a journey well worth embarking on. Absolutely recommend watching Stranger Things. You'll wish it was a neverending story :)"
1763,"ROTTEN TOMATOES, when did they become the Gods of what the movie viewers like. I watch a movie to be intertained. Not to earn a Degree. I liked the entire season 3.
And what if the Demogorgon turns out to be the one Dustin befriended and trained?"
1764,"Seasons 1&2 were great and without further ado let me tell you about season 3-it is out of this world. I won't reveal any of the plot, beacuse it would ruin everyone's viewing experience. I urge those who want to watch this season to stay away from any spoilers in any form. All actors are amazing, including the new ones. A story progresses to another level in such a clever and funny way. There are many pop cultural references throughout, which enhance the plot. This is the best season so far as it masterfully blends humor and terror, in spite of last two episodes being a hit and a miss. Jokes in those episodes seemed forced and unnecessary, despite having been written by the creators. I recall, while watching season 1&2, how much I cared for the characters and their well-being. Without beating around the bush the episodes were better written by far. To creators of this show, I say, bring back screenwriters from previous seasons and include other government produced children, seeing that Eleven is not a first number. Loose ends should be answered from season 3. Please, try not to be repetitive and/or redundant, also invest in character development, not just in visual effects, considering a wonderful cast of actors at your disposal."
1765,The Best tv serie i had seen in decade hope there Will be more
1766,"Season 1: 9/10
Season 2: 7/10
Season 3: 8/10Average: 8/10"
1767,The representation and story is very wonderful of the finest series Netflix
1768,"I admit I was lukewarm on the first season of Netflix's spooky darling, Stranger Things, when it premiered last year, enjoying the acting and theme but finding the plot constantly tripping over itself. I'm happy to say that the Duffer Brothers' second season has dramatically improved, presumably thanks to a better special effects budget and writing team.Firstly, the acting, while already solid in the first line of episodes, has improved dramatically. For the child actors, Wolfhard, McLaughlin, and Brown really excelled this season, while I still feel sorry for Will's actor, Noah Schnapp, consistently getting limited chances to shine. Ryder, Harbour, Dyer, and Keery are excellent as always, and the new members (Sean Astin, Montogmery, and Gelman) were all great additions to an already closely-knit cast, with Sadie Sink's new member to the ""party"" being my favorite. The characters are written to play off each other better than before, in addition to moments of complex tension being constantly thrown into the mix.The special effects have also stepped up drastically, with the CGI for the Upside-Down and the horrors it spawns meshing well with the sleepy small-town setting (and damn, this season's finale sequence puts the previous year's school-setting to shame). My only complaint was the seventh episode, ""The Lost Sister"", which provided some interesting development for Eleven but felt unnecessarily tied down to the uninteresting punk characters and Chicago setting for an entire episode.If you were iffy after the first season, the second improves on all fronts massively, presenting a twisting mystery begging to be solved by an incredible cast of characters."
1769,"Obviously, it is so highly-rated because of its lofty ambitions & qualities for a ""TV show"", sort of like Twin Peaks & only a couple of others. It is also fun to spot the '80s artifacts & references, esp to films. Did everyone catch the Ferris Bueller one? It is also hard to stop watching anything with some kind of ""TBD"" monster waiting to be shown. However, the problems: ET-worship goes overboard by the 4th episode. The good-girl-trying-to-go-bad schtick is a main reason for Freaks & Geeks being canceled after 1 great season. The characters and their relationships are ALL Cliché. Every single character has been done basically exactly like this in a previous (multiple) film or TV show. Here's one: where have you seen anti-social-male-teen-from-wrong-side-of-tracks interacts with world through photography before? Stock character. Check. Starting in episode 3 or 4 (iirc), characters started to make inexplicable decisions, e.g. the sheriff breaking into the top-secret federal base, the good-girl-trying-to-go-bad entering the Upside-Down, etc & the show started to go off the rails. I will almost certainly not watch Season 2. The Duffers get ""A"" for synthesis but ""D"" for originality."
1770,"I gave Stranger Things a watch after hearing good things about it. After doing that, it's now one of my favorite sci-fi TV shows. Everything about it is very well done. The storyline, characters, and music were great. The kid actors did a very good job and didn't come off as annoying. The best actors in Stranger Things were Millie Bobbie Brown and David Harbour who play Eleven and Sheriff Hopper respectively. Stranger Things has a great 80's vibe. I loved the influences from Stephen King, Elfen Lied, and other things from the 80's. I don't want to spoil the storyline for season one because it was so good. Can't wait for season two to come out. The new season can't come any quicker."
1771,"After noticing such high ratings and everyone losing their minds over this show, I gave it a try. Ever since the first episode I still have no idea why there was such an upheaval around this series.Let's break it down to the main components of the show.1) The acting was not so good. The kids were cringeworthy sometimes and, aside from the sheriff and maybe will's mom, the acting was as good as it would be in any one the 1000000 indie series we will never get to hear about.2) The story is really not that original. I mean, it's basically a generic horror movie plot. The D'n'D part was kinda cringeworthy too. It seemed to me like a classic show to kids or pre-teens, where adults are evil (DoE), and the kids are the ""chosen ones"" that will defeat the evil. The whole ""our universe is like one side of a coin"" thing is really old, and it's appeared in so many series that I've lost count.3) The music was good. That was the component I liked the most. The whole soundtrack really captures the essence of the 80s shows, which I think was the goal of the composer.All and all, it's a good show, but it's nothing compared to 9/10 shows here on IMDb, such as Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad or Sherlock (though Sunday's episode was kinda meh).Oh, and as a suggestion, The OA has kind of the same vibe as Stranger Things, but it's waaaaay better. That's a show that deserved at least an 8.5/10. But I guess timing/marketing is everything. Stranger Things arrived in the summer, when kids are out of school and ready to binge watch and hype a lot of shows."
1772,"This is very good if you like sci-fi. Maybe more suited to older nerds than younger ones who may not get the references I love the 80's vibe. Great music from the era. I was that age in 1983, oh how times have changed but this series did take me back to better(?) more innocent times. It reminds me of stuff like ET, Goonies and Wargames. No spoiler here but at one point I almost hoped they would do a scene from ET but the they chose to do something like the opening sequence to one of the Austin Powers movies. And playing games like the Hobbit on my ZX Spectrum with friends plugged into a black and white TV I bought with paper round money. Episode 8 is 10 out of 10. If you haven't seen it watch it during the Christmas holidays. The end sums up the festive period for me. HBO and Netflix make some great stuff."
1773,"Stranger Things is starting to look like the best and most gripping series since Breaking Bad. The story itself is farcical in places but this suits the style of the piece, which is both based on and stooped in fantasy and science fiction. If you are expecting pure realism or even a completely sensible plot, look elsewhere, otherwise prepare for a journey to the twisted and dark sides of the imaginations of child and adult alike. The best thing about the story is that it is so multifaceted - it is a kid's story, a fairy tale; a coming of age story; a story about adulthood, of loss, grief and responsibility. What brings this all together is the fantastic performances of the cast all round. All the child actors are brilliant and bring something unique to the table, but particular note has to be given to Finn Wolfhard and Millie Brown who's relationship and exceptional performances form the backbone of the series. Charlie Heaton is standout as a young man who's had to fill the shoes of an absent father, and really is the hidden gem of this show. Both Winona Ryder and David Harbour are excellent too, with both giving stunning and at times heart-wrenching performances throughout. Though, that being said, most of the credit must go to the kids who absolutely carry the show.The cinematography is simple, humble but beautiful. The design and appearance of the various settings are spot on, particularly the 'upside-down', which is the stuff of nightmares. The music is perfect, unique and really ties everything together whilst being the key to the suspense this show does so well. You can tell there are some clever minds behind the scenes, but as is often the case with such skillful acting overall, the show seems completely natural and there is little conscious sense that it's been so carefully written, plotted and directed.I absolutely cannot fault this show and consider it a must watch. Yes, you will have to suspend your disbelief at times, but that is the nature of a genre which plays so enjoyably with scientific fantasies."
1774,"There is a reason this is unoriginal and its because the Duffer brothers are paying homage to Stephen Kings IT since they were not allowed be a part of the big screen remake for next year. IT was one of my favourite childhood horror mini series although seems more like a long movie in reality. I knew it seemed so familiar before reading an article about the remake of the Stephen King Classic. From the outset the geeky kids who are best friends, the school bullies, the bicycles; I was almost thinking one of them would should out "" Hi ho silver away!"" when riding at speed. Of course this is a line from The Lone Ranger but its not what I associate the expression with. The lair where Winona Ryders son is discovered and how he is disconnected is almost exactly the same as the lair in IT. The alien or creature is very similar to the creatures in Stephen Kings Dreamcatcher especially when the mouth or head is open. The idea of the worm and how it gets into the water supply at the very end is identical to the goal of the creatures in Dreamcatcher. The special powers of Eleven are pretty much the same as the special powers of Duddits in Dreamcatcher who also gets weaker and is dying slowly during the movie. I was anticipating Eleven would transform into another creature to tackle and defeat the creature here that didn't quite happen but she was able to destroy it and herself together again the same result as what happens in the end of Dreamcatcher. Also in the first half of this scene when the kids are using the slingshot to fire stones at the creature this is exactly what the kids do in IT instead they are firing pieces of silver at Pennywise. I had to laugh at the morgue scene with the fake body again an exact copy of the idea from a classic Horror movie of the late 80's called Society. I think the mini series is very well done but clearly has no original ideas and just shows how underestimated and under appreciated Stephens Kings IT & Dreamcatcher are. You could say there are elements of The Goonies & ET in here too as well as The Species series of movies but mainly its IT & Dreamcatcher combined. The only new element in the series is ""The Upside Down"" which seems very like what happens in Insidious. I'm not complaining that its crap because its not original and its impossible nowadays to be original anyway but it seems most people I've talked to about this series either have never heard of IT or have forgotten most of that series and certainly never watched Dreamcatcher so they think this is original and think it deserves more credit than it actually does. Having said that the fact that the directors would try to emulate Stephen King and are excited about the big screen remake of IT tell us that they wanted to recreate what was done before and try to capture the atmosphere of a Stephen King mini series and I respect that being a big fan myself of his work. A lot of people say his books do not translate well into TV or movies which may explain why the rating for IT/Dreamcatcher are so much lower than Stranger Things however for me this show only makes me want to re-watch the classics and reminds how much better the older movies with original ideas were. Most of the acting is good and characters are likable. There are some very predictable scenes for example the fight over the girl near the cinema complex and how you know straight away what the Christmas present is before the box is opened. Also you knew Barbs was going to cut herself somehow at the pool party. Its very nostalgic and worth a look and I'm glad I watched it as its looks sharp and authentic."
1775,"if there aren't so many holes.I enjoy this series, but not sure if I like it. So far I don't really want to re-watch any episode.The good side of this series is the acting and casting. Teenagers look like teenagers, not 20-ish supper models like in other series (""scream"" for example). And acting is simply great, not the ""reading from a book"" type.But there is not one single likable character, at least not in my opinions, which make it hard to follow the story.El is great, both character and actress. Only one thing that I didn't know she was a girl when she first showed up. She has an almost shaved head, her chest is flat and she's wearing hospital outfit. Her face doesn't look very feminine, it's kind of ""neutral""but in combination of hair style and clothing, people would have thought she was a boy. Yet everybody meets her instantly knows she's a girl.The boys acting is, again, great. But their dialogues are a bit too mature for their age. Sure kids can be serious, but not adult- serious. The writer needs to go to a school and watch how children play and communicate.The crazy mother is, well, a crazy mother who believes a flashing lamp is her son's signal, and yet doesn't believe he's dead. Normally in this case people will think of spirit, ghost...not another dimension, especially when they're living in the 80s. Why doesn't she believe her son is dead? Why does she believe he's trying to communicate with her in the first place, right the first time seeing the light flash? There should be more, like the silhouette of her son or something.The supposed to be lovely innocent good girl, like in all other horror series, is OK at first. Then turns to be just like the other hotties in other series: a walking flower with no brain so that the boys in the series have a reason to follow her and kneel at her feet. Everything she does is wrong, from forcing her friend to a party and then ignore her, to going to the wood alone with another guy when she already has a boyfriend...At least the hotties in other series are actually hotties. The fact that she isn't up to Hollywood beauty is what attracted me at first, I actually thought she and her boyfriend were a cute couple, but then they ruin her character.And yes the creepy boyfriend. He in fact is one of the more believable characters. But yet, he's creepy and is made to be hated. I couldn't like him.The weirdo she follows into the wood with also falls in this category. His character's behaviors make sense, but he's not a character to like, at least not now.Anyway, the first season of this series worth a shot, just don't expect too much."
1776,"I did enjoy this show, but as I'm watching it I noticed quite a few similarities to other movies/books/stories.The first and most obvious is to Poltergeist. Alternate dimension, oowey goowey portal to another dimension, monster in the dimension, kid locked in the house, you get the picture.Next, Steven King's Firestarter. Mother had government experiments done on her with drugs, child born with abilities, big bad government now after the child. Steven King's The Body. Four young friends.Even ET, a little bit.I think that's why they set it in 1983, because that was the height of all these classic tales."
1777,"Wow wow wow. In the top 3 of all time best sci-fi TV shows ever.
Watch it n u won't be disappointed. Wow"
1778,"What a great show. Right from season one it brought back such great memories from growing up in the 80s. The interactions of main characters are so perfect. Lots of nostalgia for me. I thought it ended with season two... but I'm really glad season three was made. There is a great sci-fi horror type storyline that keeps the series moving along but I watch it almost entirely for the relationships between the kids. I just finished watching season three and it totally made me cry. This is easily one of my favorite series of all time. I heard they are making one or two more seasons, but I think it could just end here. It's such a perfect place to end it (before the scene after the credits). I really hope season four doesn't ruin it for me."
1779,"This is such a great series. I was hooked right from episode one back in 2016 and it's just unfolded and become even better. The Russian involvement in season 3 brought a whole new level to the show. Can't wait to see if they get picked up for season 4 (the final season?) and see where they go with it.So many questions... Are the Byers coming back to Hawkins, is Hopper really dead or just in a facility in Russia, will El get her powers back (probably). Only time will tell."
1780,"This series is.... oh I cannot really describe it with certain words. It is without a shadow of a doubt one of the best series I have ever watched. The directing , the acting and the editing are just mind blowing ! after watching the first two seasons I had depression because I did not want it to finish, the same thing happened to me after watching the 3rd season. WATCH IT PLEASE"
1781,"Season 1: 10; season 2: 9.5; season 3: 7.8.Everything that went into creating the series arguably makes season one the most well written and greatest series of all time, including the preparation, creativity, storyline, teleplay, directing, cinematography, casting, music, and the list goes on but doesn't stop short of blood, sweat, and tears. Not enough can be said about why and how season one is truly the best piece of work that has been created in film making.However, nothing can be said for certain about why season two, and especially season three, did not match or exceed the caliber and preeminence of season one; notwithstanding, this has happened before in fact, it happens all of the time, and there is a perfectly sound and scientific explanation, which leads to the ""why.""There is an endless list of key elements that goes into anything that meets the standard and or surpasses the level of excellence in any varying degree, field, or facet. Often, when such eminence is achieved, some of those essential and key indicators that were utilized the first time around are left behind and or forgotten along the way. This often occurs for various reasons, the most common of which is due to circumstantial pressures and standards that created drive, engendered originality, and was requisite in making such high levels of achievability possible, no longer exist.What does this mean? Well, once a mark has been made on the world, credibility has been established and the level of effort that is necessitated in making a second mark is no longer prerequisite in its entirety (by industry standards). When this occurs, dependent upon the choices and actions of those in control, often complacency begins to germinate either consciously or subconsciously but it begins to exist all the same.It is hard to believe that every level of effort and each circumstance that went into (in this case) creating season one of Stranger Things was the same (in exactness) as it occurred in the creation of season two and three. Pure creation takes much more effort than simply relying on past thoughts, ideas, and efforts. Because no one's back was up against the wall the second and third time as it was the first time around, the requisite level of effort required had been diminished and was not as relevant.Suffice it to say, unless the same mindset and circumstances are recreated that went into the production of season one, it can be expected that all subsequent seasons will not just fail to reach the same level of excellence and supremacy as season one but in no way will there exist any measure of transcendence beyond what has already been procured in any feature, aspect, dimension, or detail.Wipe the slate clean and start from scratch. Begin with a foundation built upon nothing save pure ingenuity. Only once each mind is unequivocally and wholeheartedly committed to begin from nothing but pure creation, never relying on past efforts or achievements, only then can and will unprecedented levels of preeminence and novelty be attained. In the end, the two paths will merge into one, resulting in a new, unparalleled standard and level of excellence and achievement in every facet of the art of creation but especially in that of film making."
1782,The dude is so badass and insain acting from Dacre. Dope
1783,"I think it's a series that works if you did not see any other series in your life, but as we have several top ... I found it boring and predictable. The performances are fine, no big deal. There is no character to stand out or wanting to know more. The plot is incoherent and has absurd moments. There are several events and situations of the series that made me ask, ""Really?"". Moments where the courage of some characters becomes impossible to believe; moments where science fiction and suspense are distorted by the illogical and unreasonable actions ... I think that a plot can play with unintelligible, enigmatic and irrational but always maintaining a certain internal consistency, with believable characters who were developing their skills and potential throughout history. Here many issues for granted are met, we move from fear to action without any mediation. Scenes that seem serious arise and end up being naive. They try to create an atmosphere of mystery that quickly becomes imbecility. Anyway, it seems a bad series. Maybe would have worked a little better as a movie."
1784,"Hiya leo!!
In season 3...
Hopper dies
Billy dies
Alexei dies"
1785,I think it's cute that all you reviewers think that any rational person cares what you think.
1786,"This is so emotional as Season 3 sets you off with a bumpy ride with lots of action, romance and it has a lot of emotional scenes along the way I highly recommend it if you have spare time to watch it. Stranger Things Season 3 is the best Season yet hears to the very long wait for Stranger Things Season 4 as it is going to be well worth it in the end. Plus my favourite characters are Mike And Eleven their Mileven romance is amazing true young caring romantic emotional love as a romantic I truly do love it."
1787,"Most of you are aware of how Netflix works. When they premiere an original series you get the entire season all at once. Last Friday Netflix unleashed 'Stranger Things', a mystery Science Fiction/Horror set in the 1980's. The story opens with the disappearance of a young boy with devastating effect on his mother (Winona Ryder) and his three classmates. Many of the classic elements of films from the 80's era are presented here. There are older classmates, bullies all, with the exception a girl in their group, who becomes attracted to the missing boy's older brother, an outsider. This creates friction. Matthew Modine is lurking about sinisterly with a clear connection to a strange young girl who appears and becomes involved with our three young heroes. The town's Chief of Police becomes increasingly convinced that unnatural forces are behind the disappearance. Oh, yeah. There's an inter-dimensional monster on the loose to boot. Imagine, if you will, 'The Goonies' meets the 'X-Files' meets 'The Outer Limits'. So far, so good. A fun tribute to the horror films of the '80's. I just wished that I had kept in mind that most films of that genre sucked in the 80's. Because along came episode 8, the season finale, with the realization that I'd just wasted 8 hours of my life. The story implodes into a senseless mess. Plot lines introduced aren't just left dangling, they seem forgotten. Characters who seemed relevant are rendered otherwise. And don't look for questions raised to be answered. The creators, The Duffer Brothers (Make that the Doofus Brothers.) hope you'll stay subscribed to Netflix for season two. I had hoped that this would be a self-contained story, with season two venturing elsewhere, ala 'American Horror Story'. No such luck. There's just not enough depth here for me to waste any more of my time should it return. As a rule I'm quite capable of deleting garbage from my memory. Okay, I lied. I'm still scarred by last winter's reboot of 'The X-Files'. I'll add that Stephen King gave this a thumbs up. That should have served as a warning to me since I feel his integrity as an author has been lacking for some time ('Under the Dome', anyone?). I'd have given the series a score of 8/10 but the finale ruined it. 4/10"
1788,Each season gets better and better easily in my top 3 all time greatest shows! Be ready for season 3 it's amazing start to finish!
1789,After binge watching the whole show in 1 or 2 weeks I have rewatched over and over. The show is brilliantly filmed and the actors are absolutely perfect. I am a bit annoyed about season 3 though. Unlike many others I thought season 3 was fine but I am slightly annoyed that it had to be MA15+ as lots of kids would have enjoyed season 1 and 2. Millie bobby brown and Noah schnapp are so great the whole show and they are both deserving of an Oscar. Can not wait for season 4 !
1790,All three seasons are very interesting & I think the casts have a done a good job according to their roles. Love to watch the drama between the teenagers & its worth to watch. It never feels you boring while watching this & I'll strongly recommend it.
1791,Best Hollywood web series I've seen ever.. I'm loving it
1792,"When season 1 started, it started off absolutely great, you automatically get hooked. By the time you finish it, you want more. Season 2 and 3 fill your needs, however it leaves you on the wind. Gotta wait for season 4 now, but it's absolutely worth the wait. Cast is great, acting is spot on and every other aspect is fulfilled...There's one thing you must always remember, ""3 inch minimum"" 😂😂"
1793,Well stranger things is just super fun sci fi show that you cannot miss. I watched all the 3 seasons in 4 days and I loved it. The casting is perfect storyline is amazing and production value is also top notch. The makers have left no stones unturned. Plus as the show is set in 80s which makes it look really different. So dont miss it
1794,"It's that feeling again. That nostalgic feeling that I keep coming back for each season. The characters, the setting, the soundtrack, and the story make for a perfect 80s getaway."
1795,"Another year on in Hawkins and the gang are back to fight the evil that still lingers!
I love most things 80s from music to films to games and you can be forgiven for thinking that you are living in the 80s whilst watching this season. I love the fact that they have delved deeper and darker this time round and this is testimony to the actors who really pull out all the stops to make this season work with their characters.
I can't wait for season four but a break is needed as how much can happen in one town in such a short period of time? What nemesis awaits the gang next time and will we see more of Elevens' extended family that we saw mid season 2?
I could say so much more but I want this review to be spoiler free."
1796,"Every minute is great.
I even set it on pause few times to celebrate scenario."
1797,"Original epic drama....Worth a 2 year subscription of NetFlix... you name it got all the flavours horror, suspense, spy, action, supernatural,....."
1798,Some people hated it but I thought season 3 lived up to expectations. It's not easy bringing your A game every season but I thought it was pretty amazing. Loved the choice of songs as well. Not too sure about Dustin singing to save the world (talk about bad timing) but it's supposed to be an entertaining show. Couldn't stop watching so that's good. Great acting all the way around. Could watch Steve and Dustin arguing all day!
1799,"I'm an 39 years old adult male and I just can't contain myself while watching this. There are just too many good thing to point out in it. There's literally no other movie or series out there that makes me as happy as Stranger Things does.Amazing work guys, keep it up!"
1800,"I loved every character of the show. the kids, the adults all are amazing. the relationship, the emotions between them ahh... its just great. and yeah this show have some scary monsters too."
1801,"Really good series,cant wait the next season!blab blab blab blabblab blab blab blab"
1802,"Season one, good. Season 2, meh. Season 3, who cares as long as it has a cute song in it, that everyone can relate to."
1803,"This is a show living from the 80-s genre. Stereotypical bad guys and the fantasy\sci-fi dominated that decade. This show catches the essence again in season 3. So don't be afraid. Just keep on watching and don't let these bad reviews about season 3 bother you. If you liked season 1 and 2, season 3 won't disappoint you. You will be happy, sad and grossed. Enjoy!!"
1804,My parents get enriched in this show too. Probably because they had their teenage years in the 1980s.
1805,When I first started watching Stranger Things. I thought it was going to be another typical Alien TV show. But I was so wrong! I've just finished season 3 last night. It's absolutely amazing. The cast play theirs characters brilliantly. It's got comedy action thriller and horror all in one. I'm definitely intrigued into it and cannot wait to see season 4
1806,Honestly this is my favorite season of them all and had me the most intrigued. The only thing that bothered me was product placement
1807,"Season 3 kept the elements that made Seasons 1&2 a success. Particularly liked Season 3 because there was a lot at stake and it showed with the casualties lost. The writers didn't fear, it was bold and the introduction of a lesbian character just topped it all. Great scenes, witty dialogues and respect to pop culture. Give it a watch"
1808,"As a child of the 80's myself albeit not American I can still get the sense of nostalgia with this show.
The Duffer Brothers have given me a show that's combines my favourite things together. Anything by Stephen King - you can see the influence in this - I love Stephen King.
John Carpenter - another favourite of mine.
80's - that's the big one there even though I was born 1980 I still consider that anything that comes from that decade is basically awesome. They don't make shows or films like that anymore.
But Stranger Things does this for me - I've watched this show loads of times over and I'm still not bored of it.
There's not even one character on here that I can honestly say I hate, love them all.
Thanks Duffer Brothers for giving me that Season 3 finale with Dustin and Suzy - sparked my love for anything 80's - Music, the films and most important the Horror films of the 80's. Because let's face it the likes of Clive Barker, Wes Craven, John Carpenter etc gave us some great horror movies.
So I give this show a straight 10/10 a must watch"
1809,"I honestly think this was the best tv series in my entire life. Action,sci-fi,horror all the things were remarkable. And the timing of every scene is pitch perfect. I am obessed with this series. I can watch it all 24 hours without getting bored"
1810,"As someone who was raised in the 80s, I LIVE for this show. The 80s feel to it is amazing. So many flashbacks. They replicate it perfectly. The nostalgia is never ending. The theme music is creepy on its own but the show overall is creepy and entertaining. The show has gotten some bad reviews for season 2, but its because they were expecting it to be the same as season 1. Sorry to say, but thank god it wasn't. Its nice to have variety and contrast. The first season will always be the best (IMO), but thats not to say 2 wasn't great. The newest season 3 was everything i hoped for and well worth the wait. The arguing and yelling between Jim and Joyce was a little off-putting and a little much but not enough for me to knock any points off. Each episode kept you wanting more, so it definitely did its job. Im hoping for at least 2 more seasons but even then I will be sad to see it go. It will forever be a classic. If it does return for a season 4, I hope we don't have to wait 2 years again for a new season. Bravo to the writers, producers, cast, special effects team, editing team and everyone in between."
1811,"Loved the 3rd act of the series, somewhat better than season 2. This itself is worthy of something. Season 3 is brighter more colorful, more humor, less scary and certainly more musical.
The problem is only one. The story. The plot is thin and does not live up to the season 1 standard. However it is quite enjoyable specially for the 80s music and fun elements. A must binge for anyone."
1812,Anachronistic and boring. I really don't understand the hype. The only reason I didn't give it 1 Star was because the acting is decent.
1813,"This TV show is about as nice to watch as a Disney movie. It's certainly entertaining in its own manner. However if it was not for some effects that are typical for Horror movies like ""Poltergeist"" and many others I would say it is more appropriate for Children than for adults.Some boys around the age of 12 are fighting bad guys and a monster from a parallel world who is responsible for the disappearance of their friend who now is not available to play board games anymore. They have a girl with Superpowers helping them. The bad guys are trying to find the girl with the Superpower so the boys help her to hide.The boy who has disappeared also has his mother trying to find him. In this she is being supported by the Police Chief.Then there is a side plot with some adolescents behaving like - well, adolescents, or better like adolescents in American movies for adolescents. One is the guy all girls are after, the other one is the outsider the girl falls in love with. Of course the adolescents - or at least some of them - are involved in fighting the evil monster. However the adolescents still find enough time to party and to drink beer, but sometimes they happen to be kidnapped by the monster.All of this is funny and nice to watch, but after all that hype I would have certainly expected much more than a mixture between ""Poltergeist"" and The Famous Five."
1814,"Firstly, don't get me wrong; the casting, acting, direction, editing and visuals here are second to none.But I really don't get the show. Admittedly I'm only half way through season 1, so my opinions might change, but I just don't get all the praise for the show. It's just, to me anyway, a ""throw it all in and hope for the best"" mix of previous 80's hits.So. You've got a bunch of kids chasing something they don't know or understand. They work out some weird meaning that the adults simply wont understand and they go on a crazy secret mission to catch the bad guys. It's all very Goonies/BMX Bandits. Then it goes into a modern horror Hemlock Grove type adult horror territory entering an utterly genreless confusion.Its like Spielberg took a Stephen King story and asked John Carpenter to direct it. And John Carpenter said, ""F%%% off, do it yourself"". So it ended up a potentially good horror ruined by Spielberg family values and cuddliness.Like I say, it is well directed and acted and looks great. All the 80's stuff is cool (except for the almost constant and monotonous 80's electro duna duna duna duna background music which seems cool at first but soon becomes really annoying). But if you want 80's cute kids having adventures, watch The Goonies or BMX Bandits again. If you want weird horror goings on in a grown person environment, watch Hemlock Grove.But like I say, I'm only half way through the first season . . . .21/09/2016. Watched final episode and my opinion is . . . .It's not a kids thing, it's not a grown ups thing, it's not even a tweeny thing. It is A thing, of sorts. And there's bound to be second season. I'll probably watch and complain about that too."
1815,A true 80s series...would love to watch things like this
1816,Episodes 7 and 8 were really amazing and the build up to those episodes was nicely put together. I think it's the best one so far.
1817,"I want to make one thing clear I watched only the first season which left me happy but not happy enough to move on. Also to my opinion, only the first season is worth it. Would I rewatch it? HELL NO!! Unless someone pointed a gun at me.
I mean it WAS pretty fun ...."
1818,"I see reviews complaining about season 3, about how the kids hit puberty, etc. Seasons 1-3 were all amazing. Season 1 had demigorgans. Season 2 had demodogs and the mind flayer and season 3 had all kinds of monsters and Russians. People say it was unrealistic. Well that's the point! It's supposed to be unrealistic! It's a show about teens fighting monsters and Russians. There's complaints about the fact that the kids hit puberty. Like really? It's gonna happen. Season 3 had surprises. I saw reviews say it was cringey because of teen drama and breakups. They're teenagers! There are gonna be breakups and drama. There's been so many complaints and it the fact that El and Mike broke up. I thought it was good for them! It got Mike to admit he loves her and she finally was able to be herself. I think that's good. There's pretty good representation in Stranger Things. Amazing characters. It's just an amazing show. The duffer brothers are geniuses."
1819,Teenage story line with thrilling experience and must watch for all.
1820,"When i started watching stranger things, i didn't think it would be as good as it is. Great plot, great characters, great acting and so on.Season 1 was really good but I didn't really feel like we got any interactions with the characters.Season 2 was the one i least liked. I didn't like that we got whole new characters into the show, so it just made everything confusing.Season 3 was great. It really gave that iconic 80's style into it. Great season and it was pretty scary(in a good way).A thing i didn't i like so much about the show was that it wasn't like what it promised.Still great"
1821,"The show is quirky, campy and ok. Just ok. I have seen a LOT worse on Netflix. It is definitely geared for a younger audience.I like picking out all the 80s stuff. But the show ""borrowing"" things and plot points from older syfy and horror films gets old fast. It's a remix of:
Firestarter
Goonies
Aliens
E.T.
Invasion of the Body Snatchers
And probably over a dozen othersThe plot holes are enormous: guns kill the bad things, just not when soldiers use them for example. That being said, it should have ended after one season - but far be it for the industry not to wring every last dollar out of something until it's destroyed."
1822,This is an amazing series ! amazing and I honestly can't wait for season 4!!!!
1823,The duffer brothers are geniuses the sci-fi horror series is great I have even made people watch it and they said it was the best thing ever
1824,Just Wow!! This show was amazing and spectacular. All three seasons were equally great. Can't wait for season 4
1825,"It has everything Horror, comedy, action, emotions.... Season 1 is little slow but season 2 and 3 are bang on"
1826,I watch this web series lot of time I think near about 5 time and I love this web series so much I waiting for season 4
1827,This is mind blowing..... I never ever watched a series like this
1828,"""This is one of a hell masterpiece, alright this is gonna be a very long review, alright one by one ok get ready, season 1 is a crazy season like i am never seen a series with the opening like that like the first 5 minutes the climax it's began like it's so fast for just 1 episode, but that's awesome, there's a lot happen on season we intruduced by this 4 group and then 1 is eating by the monster, lot of crazy stuff happening start from gory to really weird, and then they intruduced eleven (millie bobby brown character), with her superpower, balds hair, don't know lot of words, that's is a perfect choosing look and personality, it's end with el says goodbye to mike who actually the real things is she still alive and beat the monster, season 2 for me is getting more interested because in season 1 i can say there's not a lot of character in there but season 2 is more of a added character, season 2 is more crazier, begins with the monster who still live in Will body, season 2 intruduced l ot of new and important character especially Max and Billy character here, El is actually still alive and live with Jim Hooper, and the interesting things in here that we more know about El life, from her sister and her mother, and i think that's a really good story to tell about, and they ended with a crazy and awesome scene, and the dancing scene in the end just ok but still awesome, now season 3 hey they grow up! they voice changing!, season 3 is more growing up rather than season 1 and 2 you know because they age too, now season 3 i more grown up because you know a kissing scene between El and Mike in the very first episode is kinda disturbing me , and then we got intruduced again by this new kinda important character too, season 3 is very different if we see season they're mission are same and the place is same too, in season 3 the mission kinda different but but connected too, and in the different place, season 3 for me is the best season from the last 2 season, more creepy, more crazy, and of course more awesome, they ended very perfect and very emotional, the color, the shot it's just amazing, this marathon that i'm doing 3 days in a row will be remembered till i grow up, and this series will never been forget, i have never seen a series like this before how emotional and how crazy this is, acting no doubt perfect, a character build up perfect, some reference is very cool, and for the love story between El and Mike i just want to write this 4 sentence ""i hate they relationship"" even thought they just like kissing i still hate that but at least they nit having sex, and you know the most enjoyable,fun,and one of the most important character here is Murray character i really like that guy, and what i really sad is when Jim death, oh you know i'm crying yes i don't care but i like literally crying and saying his name, that's all my review i'm ready for season 4 my hope for season 4 is one bring back Jim, that's all i need, and yes i really hate the jumpscare, it's unexpected and loud, seriously there's a million jumpscare here, last words for me is Friends Don 't Lie"""
1829,"Stranger Things is rife with references to American pop culture of the late Seventies and early Eighties. If someone is not well-versed in the movies, music and other media of that era, then they are not the target audience. Regardless, I would recommend the show to anyone because it's worth finding out if it's a show for you. I have hardly ever met someone who only liked Stranger Things ""a little."" Usually, if someone enjoys this show, they enjoy the hell out of it.The show's scene-to-scene writing has become exceptionally stronger in some areas and disappointingly weak in others over the course of three (and counting) seasons. Some uninteresting, repetitive dialogue and flashbacks betray that someone at the table doesn't trust the audience to understand everything without being helped along, even though all the core concepts of the story are relatively popular tropes. Meanwhile, the characters grow in unexpected, pleasing new ways. Each season's flaws have become progressively more noticeable (especially if you are someone who enjoys re-watches) but this has not kept the show from being entertaining, broadly speaking.Stranger Things has never failed to tug at my heartstrings, but the most recent season's conclusion is cause for teary eyes. It's an ending that could have felt too similar to the ending of Avengers: Endgame, given the timing of its release, but in fact it stands very well on its own. And that's the most remarkable thing about the whole show: no matter how much it borrows from other material, the creative team manages to weave every strand into an artwork that feels unique and is a joy to watch.Quite by accident, the last two seasons have coincided with the occurring of difficult situations in my personal life, and the show's themes of moving on from great trauma and loss have been a comfort. I think a lot of us have a show like that, and I think it's a beautiful thing."
1830,I've re-watched this series again recently waiting for the new season to come out as I can't get enough.
1831,Amazing Series Want To Watch It Again And Again.Waiting For The Season 4 Anxiously
1832,"First season 10/10
Second 9/10 Some things could be made better and that plot with city hope will be in next seasons
Season three 10/10 but I did hoped there would be theme park encaunter mass panic the usual stuff"
1833,"Finally got to see this one. Stranger things is the best series i've every watched. Probably the only series where I felt connected to the characters and concerned bout them. Though, it's a sci fi horror series but it also has a bunch of comedy, romance and thriller. It's a multiple genre. Now, what in liked the most is the character development. El, Mike & his friends (Lucas, Dustin, Max, Will), Nancy, Jonathan, Mrs. Buyers, Hopper all of them wins our hearts at a very small time. The transformation of Steve Harrington is also worth watching. Especially Millie Bobby Brown as El is the most charming one. Also, as it is based in the 80s it has various pop culture references and lifestyle of the 80s, which is very relatable, even adults can enjoy. The concept of upside down, the shadow monster, the Demogorgan all seems to be inspired from ET, It, Insidious but never seemed a copy. It's original in it's own way. Overall, a great series, best watched binge.P.S. This review was for Season 1 and 2. Cos, i didn't watched S3, i'll update it later."
1834,"The first season is fantastic. All of the references to growing up in the 80's are spot on and bring you right back. ""My family had those dishes!"" etc. The acting is great. The story itself is a bit predictable and a bit of a quilting of other 80's ""horror"" but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. I enjoyed each subsequent season less."
1835,"The Stranger Things intro theme is the quintessential example that less is more and a haunting melody can reverberate the very depths of the human soul.The Netflix original is a love letter expertly written to Spielberg, John Carpenter and others from the 80's. The plot matches the tone and the characters are a perfect accompaniment to drive the script home each of the eight episodes.Subjectively, I felt as though the revelation of the Demogorgon's appearance did not translate effectively to the tense, creepy tone the Duffer Brothers achieved. The aesthetic recalled more to a licker from Resident Evil 2 than anything original."
1836,"By far one of the best coming of age shows or shows in general. I love the vibe, the characters from eleven to billy, and the music! The horror/thriller vibe is my favorite and the 80s theme (which I did not live through the time but is weirdly so great for me). I wish that I did because is seemed so simple, (besides the whole monster thing). I have bought books to get into the minds of the Duffer to see the thought process which makes me love it more. I need to get on that Stephen King train so i get further understand the cool references. Overall this show is a masterpiece in my eyes, and it will forever hold a place in my heart."
1837,"And that cannot be said for a lot of programs now produced. With a cop show to your left and teen schlock to your right, ""Stranger Things"" keeps it real with rightly paced storylines and characters you can root for. It cannot always make good on its promises, especially in the later seasons, but this manner of nostalgic yet novel narrative must be commended."
1838,"Since this show was released back in 2016, Netflix started to really get down to producing quality movies and TV shows. I've been watching since the day it came out, so I have A LOT to say about it. I, personally, believe that this was the show that really gave Netflix Originals a positive name. The characters are so great. You can see them change over the course of the seasons and you really get attached to them and invested in each of their stories. Unfortunately, not all of the characters get better. There are scenes in season 3 of Mike and Eleven that are just irritating. It's annoying to see them constantly on each other's arms. This would typically be fine, but they're constantly ditching the party to be alone and they're rude to Hopper who's just trying to figure out how to be the best dad he can be for Eleven. However, Max Mayfield is a breath of fresh air. Her independence, sass, and overall personality is a nice step away from Mike and El. Max and Lucas aren't constantly with each other. And yes, I know that Mike and El are kids and they just want to be together, but kids still need to make time for friends and family. Throughout the seasons the effects get better and better and by the third season, just seeing the monster will make you gag. It's slimey realism and just the way it moves is very well animated. They really did a great job with making such a repulsive creature. All the monsters are fantastically portrayed throughout all seasons. Every season leaves you with questions yet to be answered and every episode leaves you on the edge of your seat. You just want El and Will to be able to live normal lives. There aren't many characters (other than the government agents and Brenner) that you completely hate. Many of the characters are so conflicting, and it's interesting to see all the different backgrounds and their reasoning for acting the way they do. Overall it's a good show that really keeps you hooked and is so huge in pop culture. If you like sci fi or thrillers/horrors then this is absolutely the show for you! See you all in season 4😉"
1839,"In short:
Season 1: Fantastic!!
Season 2: ehh.. Kinda weird.. But still good.
Season 3: Holy Mother Of Heck...Starting off, the show and actors were definitely crowd-pleasers. As the show went on it was plain to see that it took on a ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" type of maturing such as the show became darker, more violent, more graphic and more matured storylines, assuming that the viewers would mature along with them. And, eh, it would take a lot to get to a ""Stranger Things: Season 3"" level of maturity.
Mostly in part of the cult-like mind-infected suicide, mild adultery themes, language and main character deaths. This is just a warning, though, because the show is still clever and intriguing.R. I. P. Alexei, Hopper and Billy."
1840,"I hadn't seen this show till recently (currently not done season 2). It was one of those shows i had queued on Netflix on my list but never got around to watching.I love sci-fi, and what's more, I love thriller and drama shows. One of my favorite things about the show isn't even the storyline, it's the cast. This show did what a lot of mainstream shows tried but failed at, adding cheesier elements (like the love triangle between Jonathan, Nancy and Steve; chemistry between Mike and El, and so on) but with a strong storyline.The one bad thing I didn't like was how much I feel was revealed in one season. I felt like in itself season 1 could've wrapped up the story and been good enough. I fear that the writting might get sloppy as the seasons go on and the storyline will start falling apart. I hope the Duffer bros are good and don't ruin it. Season 2 and onwards to me gets bland and generic. I stopped watching because it started getting stupid imo but first season was good."
1841,"Season 1 is a 10, season 2 is still great but I'd give it an 8 or 9; it keep certain characters apart for extended periods of time and in my opinion it hurts the show by keeping characters with great established chemistry away from each other. I get what they were going for because of the storyline they went with, but I just kept wanting to see certain characters together. Still a fantastic show though and I can't wait for season 3."
1842,"This is a big debut, including with IT, by Stephen King, also starring Finn Wolfhard as one of the characters. Everyone plays their part fantastically, and it's a mysterious, spine-tingling story. Winona Ryder is such a great actress, and she really does suit the part of a nervous wreck, trying to get people to understand her. It's appropriate for kids above 13, but once you reach the age, you definitely have to watch this show. It makes you hang on edge for every episode, sitting at the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happens next. There's no fluff in here, only what could happen under a real circumstance like this. Watch this, and you'll be hooked."
1843,"A masterpiece for every kind of people.(young,old,kid) full of entertainment and interesting.story is fast,nothing to bore..its enjoyable.
Like as got it has become my favourate series.10/10"
1844,"Didn't know what to expect, but enjoyed every minute of this completely unique masterpiece. Brilliantly created with a lovely 80's feel. Looking forward to the third series !!"
1845,Best part is el and hoppers acting and Netflix schould stream next season this year only
1846,"Simply amazing! Well written, tremendous acting for being young children and the dialogue is great along with the special effects, very excited for the next season."
1847,"In a word, this show is incredible. There's infinite amounts of character development, twists you never expect, and an incredible sci-fi thriller atmosphere beneath the idyllic air of the 1980's. This show is absolutely worth your time, and you'll be binge-watching it before you know it."
1848,Love this show so much!!! I love the characters and I love the plot line!! Like wow!! I would watch this show over and OVER AGAIN!! I don't care I love Stranger Things!! And I'm so glad that they've won another award for their amazing success. CONGRATS GUYS!!
1849,I Loved Stranger Things season 1 and 2.Stranger things is the best.The direction is wonderful.The cast are excellent in their roles.The Duffer brothers capture the 1980s fantastically.For a moment I thought I was watching a 1980s show.The show is very nostalgic and reminds of the 80s when the shows were so excellent.Over all execution and production of the show is brilliant.I hope the show continues for at least 6 seasons.I Love Stranger Things.Well done Duffer Brothers.Best Show ever made.I just Love the show!
1850,"The characters are incredible, acting is fantastic and the soundtrack is super."
1851,Stranger Things is honestly an incredible show. I guess more people like it than people that don't like it. I keep reading these reviews and they are all talking out their ass. *Bad Script*. What? The show is basically set as a movie ( an 8 hour long movie per season ) the structure is incredible. It works really well with many separate plot stories that we follow through the show and we never lose interest in any of them. The separate plot points connect together so well that I don't think I've ever seen it been done on a show that well. *duffer brothers don't know what homage is* just shut up honestly. The show is filled with nostalgia from 80s pop culture. The duffer brothers are taking certain parts and mixing them all together and it works. Unlike other homages to pop culture ( ready player one ) you are still engaged in the story and seem to forget the references. The show isn't just copying everything there is a unique story. It's all movie cliches that everyone's seen before but never together. If you haven't seen the show I recommend you watch both seasons they really are amazing. The other reviewers giving it under 7 stars are missing the big part in that is it enjoyable. It very much is my friends
1852,"Obviously, people love this show. Currently, it has 8.9 on IMDB, it has 94% on Rotten Tomatoes... so, yeah. It's one of the most popular shows out there now. But is it really that good? Let's see.First of all, Stranger Things is an extremely well-made series. The atmosphere is there, it's well-direcred, acting is surprisingly good (even kids are doing great here), it's very stylish, soundtrack is very solid and has a lot of licensed songs from the past... It's some really high quality job we have here. The problem is - the story.Long story short, Stranger Things is some sort of tribute to 80s and 90s. Which (technically) may be a right choice. People love 80s, after all. People who were born back then love them because of pure nostalgia, millennials love them because of all that pop culture thing that makes them want to feel ""rad"" too from time to time... 80s can sell stuff. Any kind of stuff. From video games to expensive movies. So, the choice do feel right. Especially since, like I said, Netflix did some really good job here. Not only Stranger Things is a stylish show, it was able to create the right atmosphere. Like 2017 version of It did. It does feel like 80s. Like real 80s. Even if you were born back then, you won't feel like somebody's trying to fool you here. It feels like a real deal.Unfortunately, Stranger Things went too far in its chase for vintage feeling. If you wasn't born yesterday, you'll be able to see that this show has nothing new in it. Exactly nothing. It just takes a lot of stuff from the old movies and TV shows and just throws it at you all over again. E.T., The X-Files, It, Twin Peaks, you name it. I'm pretty sure they did it on purpose, just because some scenes were re-created as is, without even trying to hide it, and it may be OK as some sort of tribute, but... there's nothing else here. Only those recycled ideas and images from the old shows. And that's exactly what kills the show to me. The Duffer Brothers are clearly love retro, but they literally lost themselves in it. And all that reminds me a lot of Ready Player One effect. It's cool to see a town with heavy Twin Peaks feeling in it with those mysterious guys from The X-Files and kids interacting with strange and scary things like in E.T., or It. But every single minute I keep asking myself ""What's new here?"" And the answer is - nothing. The whole writing feels like it was done by some schoolkid. A very nerdy schoolkid, who just loved all those old movies and TV shows and therefore wanted to make ""something like them"". You know how it is when kids begin to write their first stories. They just collect everything they like, mix it together and call it their own. That's pretty much what happened here. Back in my school days there was no chance to get a good grade for such a lame work. Just because you can barely call it a proper writing. It's just that - an imitation.Like Ready Player One (the book came out in 2011, so, I think it's OK to compare stories), story in Stranger Things isn't that important. Because the whole thing is more like an amusement park. It shows you 80s, you can see a lot of vintage stuff you probably used to have as a kid, it lets you hear some popular music from that period, it makes you remember about the old shows you used to love as a kid... but it doesn't really create anything new. It's not a thing on its own. Just a high quality tribute. Stranger Things may be fun to watch with some pizza and beer on your day free, but, like I said, it's just a way to enjoy the atmosphere and remember the real deals you used to see before. There's nothing to remember. Nothing to keep in your heart for years. Nothing to contribute to pop culture. It's an imitation. And when it's about imitations, it doesn't really matter how nicely they're done. Those are imitations and that's it. So, sorry, no high rating from me. You don't put an imitation of good paining in your living room. You put it in your toilet."
1853,"The Netflix Original Series Stranger Things began airing in 2016 and recently finished its second season. The first season focuses on three 12 year old boys (Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, and Caleb McLaughlin) that are investigating the disappearance of their friend (Noah Schnapp) while supernatural events occur in their town, including the appearance of a girl with psychokinetic and telepathic abilities (Millie Bobby Brown) that the boys befriend. The second season depicts the boys and their friend's struggle with the remaining supernatural forces.Not only does Stranger Things include a character in the 5% of all characters with disabilities on screen that are portrayed by disabled actors, but this character is part of the even smaller minority of disabled characters whose storylines are not defined by their disability.Louise Dyson, the managing director of visABLE, a talent agency for disabled, actors, presenters and models, has said, ""In an ideal world,"" disability status ""really wouldn't matter and everyone would be considered for every role for which they are considered suitable. If you have a character who is portraying anything other than a getaway driver, why can't they be blind?""Actor Gaten Matarazzo has gotten a taste of 'an ideal world' in his portrayal of Dustin on Stranger Things. Both Matarazzo and his character are affected by a mild case of cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD), a genetic disorder that affects the bones and teeth.The character Dustin was originally not written as disabled, but Matarazzo auditioned anyway despite the fact that he had been previously been turned down for roles because of his lisp, teeth, and height. Once Matarazzo earned the part, the show's creators said they were going to incorporate CCD ""and use it in a realistic way. They asked"" Matarazzo"" if it was okay if the kids in the show had bullied"" him ""because of it."" He ""said it's totally cool. It's realistic"".True to their word, the writers incorporated Dustin's CCD in the very first episode when he is bullied for his toothless lisp and replies, ""I told you a million times, my teeth are coming in! It's called cleidocranial dysplasia"". After this interaction, Dustin's disability is never directly addressed again. The audience just accepts that CCD is a part of Dustin's identity along with his curiosity, love of Dungeons & Dragons, and sense of adventure.Besides the bullying, Dustin's disability does not separate him from his peers. He is just another protagonist along with his nondisabled friends, and he engages in the same adventures as them.Characters with disabilities that are played by disabled actors raise awareness and understanding of their community's experiences while also serving as a positive role model for disabled fans. Matarazzo is an inspiration to others affected by CCD and has received messages saying ""You made me feel better about myself, that you can show that you have this condition on TV and embrace it"".In the context of today's society where disabilities are so heavily stigmatized, the disabled community needs platforms for disabled actors such as Gaten Matarazzo in Stranger Things and RJ Mitte in Breaking Bad to share their experiences and normalize their representation in media. The casting of disabled actors into roles where ability status is not specified is a step towards reducing the stigma."
1854,"Very little can be better than this. Stranger Things is one big shining pearl. Everything about it is perfect. The bond, the chemistry you build with the characters, the way they change and evolve throughout the 2 seasons, the 80's and the style and music it brings, the emotions pouring out of the character's eyes and hearts because of the pitch perfect acting they are producing, the kids and the parents, the visuals and the setting... all packaged in one small neighborhood 10/10"
1855,"OMG, this show is crazy, I never thought it would be so good. It gives me goosebumps so many. I never thought that direction and writing were that good, but after watching this Goodbye to GOT. As usual ""El"" is so amazing. Heads off to Noah Schnapp, David Harbour they did an incredible job.Fantastic Job was done by everyone, every young individual is so talented.Every scene was well captured.I am just waiting for the next Season because I think it will gonna blow our MIND."
1856,"This is the best thing I have ever seen. It is so fun to watch. 
The casting is amazing every character feels like a complete character.
Just the whole thing feels complete.
Lets hope they make a few more seasons to enjoy."

1858,"Right on to the subject, I will not even try to talk about everything that this great show has,because most of it has already been covered. The sources of inspiration for this show are many, and I am happy to see that Carpenter is one of the biggest ones.But aside all that, what fascinates me the most about this show, is how all of it is a huge nod to kids and the vivid imagination that kids posses. And it actually is amazing - imagination is not just a tool to wander off carelessly. It is a flashlight of our current opus of knowledge that we as humans have at any given moment in time. Imagination, like a flashlight, reaches out of that opus, into the unknown, and helps us visualise what we still don't know. Exactly like in the show, where a bunch of 80s kids go on pair with a terrible upside down world filled with horrors. Never stop being a child, at least for that tiny part that lets you roam other worlds no matter how hard your work, school, college is,This show - I just love it and I hope to see a cameo of Carpenter in it in the future."
1859,"Quite enjoyable, but curtailed a bit by rather dated stuff; '60s mindfvuk throwback sci-fi, slimy horror beasties, and the usual idiomatic film ""stings"" hedge the whole enterprise 'round, to my mind.What's good? The production work is fantastic. The casting, acting, direction, set work, editing and the rest are top-shelf. Taking the dated nature of the horror idiom work into account, the writing is fine.That summarizes it. If you like a fairly well-told tale of psychic lab escapees tapping parallel realities for evils that can (hopefully) serve state power, mixed with period, aw-shucks small-town folksiness (including nerd/punk kids), plus a measure of dated horror film idiom thrown in......check it out."
1860,"Ever since I started the first episode of the first season, I was very intrigued. The directors started the show just as someone would at the end of a season, with a cliff hanger. This was great to include because it grabs your attention immediately while starting off the plot of the show. The first episode, alone, creates so much suspense and thrill, keeping viewers at the edge of their seats. From the moment you start the first episode, it takes place in a dark and isolated building at night. Then, the suspense starts, with blinking lights and a door swinging open and a guy running through it. This automatically creates curiosity as to what happened and why he is running. Next, a moment of him standing in a big empty elevator, looking down a long and dark hallway, waiting for the doors to close. This part was thought out very well because it draws your attention to the hallway, making you expect something to happen in the hallway. Then, he hears something, looks up, and you see him pulled up and dangling as the doors finally close. All of this happens in the first minute and a half of the show. The directors, the Duffer brothers, did an amazing job at capturing the suspense of the moment and the attention of the audience and making them curious and anxious to see what comes next. Throughout the rest of the show, the suspense continues as characters are introduced and put into new situations. The back stories of all of the characters really grow throughout both seasons and that makes the show even stronger because you get a feel for how life is or these people and what type of things they are going though. I also love how in the second season, they also included ""normal"" things in life, such as the dance, in addition to the sci-fi."
1861,"Honestly, I have no words. This is, and will remain the best show I have ever seen. The music, the writing, the theme, just makes it a special snowflake for me. I really can't wait for the third season to come out, and maybe we will see if the kids will ever have some rest. (Hopefully Will.)"
1862,"I usually don't write reviews. I just want to say that this is one of the best shows on TV right now. The fact that , there is no complex story, very few fillers, no boring moments. No gory violence (GOT type at least). no nudityThe characters really grow on you. The show revolves around 11 (Millie Brown) but the other characters are just as great. They have a great job with the music, characters , and music of course. The kids put on a great show, better than some adults on TV. Hope this help. hope you like it #eleven"
1863,"OK first off, this is an amazing show. How anyone could give it a rating below an 8 is incomprehensible to me, let alone those who gave it a 1!!!!! I've read some pretty horrible reviews on Stranger Things and I'm really not sure why. One viewer said that Winona Ryder is a terrible actress when that couldn't be farther from the truth. From the start her acting was on point. Perhaps those who say this don't have the empathy to understand the love a mother has for her child. They simply cannot relate. Talking as a neurotic mother myself, her take on the role spoke to me. I felt like it could have been me. Her acting is great IMO given her circumstances in the show. The 80's element is completely irrelevant to me. Yes it is a cool element but it does not make or break the show, the story stands on its own. Stranger Things is an incredibly gripping, gut wrenching, suspenseful sci-fi masterpiece. This is in my top 3 shows of all time. I can't fathom having to wait a whole year for season 3 (hoping there will be one)! It's going to be hard. To those who are conflicted on whether or not to watch it, just give it a try. You will be entertained at the very least or you'll see it for what it is, an amazing masterpiece!"
1864,"...when you combine a great cast, intense writing of a great story, strong directing, excellent production values and wrap it together with a classic 80's soundtrack.The good first:A combination of an amazing young cast with some veteran older actors find more than a bit of magic.Story is intense and engaging. A great mix of horror, scifi,and coming of age drama. Directing is on point.Production is well done with a nice combination of solid cinematography and solid, but not overdone, CGI.The bad(such as it is):Thought the 1st season dragged just a bit in the middle.Overall:Well worth the price of admission. Expect to watch it again from the start when season 3 comes out."
1865,"The 80's aren't so much a scene as a character in this show. The town and the kids are almost from a fairy tale that isn't old enough yet to be lore. The first season deals with a boy being stolen and a girl being found. A small group of friends begin to see that their town is gateway to something more. The girls origins are as mysterious as the missing boy, but she is the key to returning him. Soon they have to travel to a place of darkness to save their friend. The first season is scary and sweet. You will feel anger and mistrust towards some characters in the beginning and then end up liking them in the end. The ending is as unpredictable as everything else in this movie. It does get boring at times and the plot wanders, but It is redefining scary shows. The friendship among the young actors brings a ton of chemistry to their characters and elevates a true sense of humanity and what its like to be a kid. I just started season two and its just so great. Watch it. Watch it now."
1866,"""Stranger Things"" is a good show-it's very well directed and acted, it has a really fascinating mystery, and a portion of the first episodes are beautiful. The acting in this is brilliant, particularly from the more youthful members of the cast. It's exceptionally intriguing, sometimes scary and sometimes funny.Overall I prescribe it to everybody, exceptionally entertaining and you will feel a sense of connections with the characters. Congratulations to the Duffer Brothers!"
1867,"The first season is amazing! I have been anxiously awaiting the second season, and then I watched the trailer. As excited as I am to see what happens, I am completely walking away from it simply because it found a way to include a deservedly dead pedophile's music. I understand the era and time it was popular, but there are many more musical hits that could have been used. Thanks for ruining the series for me!"
1868,"My episode by episode ratings will give you an idea of the kind of show it is and how good it is:Ep1- 9/10 Ep2- 8/10 Ep3- 7/10 Ep4- 10/10 Ep5- 6/10 Ep6- 7/10 Ep7- 8/10 Ep8- 8/10Because there's no excellent elevation, we'll take the cumulative average:7.8/10It's a pretty good show that starts compelling, but that by episodes 5-6 really loses its steam. It regains some in episodes 7-8 but never hits its two best from early on. Ep 4 is the best one.The directing and editing is superb and casting is good. I liked it and would recommend a look, especially at the first 4 episodes, but eps 5-6 you could miss most of and not miss much. A decent show that once again proves just how elite Breaking Bad was because it doesn't come close to it. 7/10"
1869,This show just blew me away when I first watched it it's amazing and the 80s setting was great because that's when I grew up but I hope for the new season there is more episodes because there was only 8 for the first season but they do that sometimes just to see if people like the show so they probably will be more roll on October.CANT WAIT.!!!!!!
1870,"This a very good series. It atmospherically reanimates the 1980s, a decade which despite never having seen myself, seems to be the home of many of my favorite stories. The series's reliance on child actors, a bet which I think rarely turns out well for directors, seems to have succeeded here. The special effects were masterfully and more importantly tastefully done. Winona Ryder is the real star of the series though, and her portrayal of haggard single mother is mundane and brilliant. Another great Netflix series! I look forward to watching the next season.(I binged this in February 2017.)"
1871,I hope everyone reading this blog have seen the film E.T by Steven Spielberg and if you haven't seen the film please go and check it out because it's an awesome film which has inspired several other films and shows for more than 20 years in the sci-fi genre and this show is one of them.This show has not only taken the sci-fi element of the movie but also the style of it's execution.It just means the show has many similarities with the movie and had a great impact on the audience.The show is crazy and the amount of accolades it got was equally crazy.Check out articles like this at : www.paul96.orgArticles related to the show : http://paul96.org/stranger-things-the-enhanced-little-one/ http://paul96.org/eleven-the-ferocious-wonder-kid/ http://paul96.org/mike-wheeler-and-friends-the-four-lads-of-hawkins/ http://paul96.org/stranger-things-other-characters/ http://paul96.org/the-concept-of-super-powers-subjecteleven/ http://paul96.org/stranger-things-the-best-episodes/
1872,"Best TV show I have seen in years. Characters are believable, plot is amazing, actors are great! I read a review somewhere that said it reminded old adventures produced by Steven Spielberg and I cannot make a better statement. Even though the trailer seems too dark, it doesn't happen during the episodes. It is a brilliant show, engaging and funny."
1873,"This is by far one of the greatest artistic creations/accomplishments of more than a decade. Duffer Brothers, you astound me. This series from start to finish (including the composed title music) is an absolute brilliant accomplishment. It's ominous, complicated, a cinematographic brilliance, and much more. The cast Winona Ryder was superb and the young actors couldn't have been a better cast. I absolutely cannot wait until the new season and am making sure everyone I know watches...even if I have to tie them a chair to binge watch season one. An absolute A+++.Cheers!"
1874,"Stranger Things is not the only the story about the adventures of Mike, Lucas and Dustin who try to find their missing friend. Nor it is only a story about a mysterious little girl called Eleven. It is something more meaningful, you feel it, the atmosphere and everything that encloses that beautiful TV show. People have different opinions and if you do not like something you do not have to hate on it. Just stay away from it. The down ratings Stranger Things gets are from the people who just can not accept the opinions of others. You can not give a TV show like that one star or two because there is too much effort put in it. My favorite TV show, thank you for that Duffer Brothers."
1875,"**POSSIBLE SPOILER--VERY SUBTLE**Take the Goonies, make one of their friends an X-Man, put them in E. T., and replace E. T.'s mysterious government organization with the Syndicate from the X-Files, and then throw in liberal amounts of Easter Eggs from dozens of iconic 80s movies and comic books of the 20th century, and you start to get the idea of what Stranger Things is like. Rarely does a sci-fi show or movie hit all of the essential points for a perfect formula. This show manages it brilliantly, and like any good sci-fi, convinces you that this could actually happen, in spite of the fact that the premise is absurd. It does a brilliant job of keeping the focus on our core characters, and telling the story through their limited perspective. Further, the story never misses an opportunity to gradually develop it's characters with exquisite care. Whether we're seeing Joyce's manic desperation escalating, or Nancy's obsession grow, or Michael's infatuation progress we're never rushed and the show takes great care to make sure every character makes sense, and every scene leaves a lasting impression. A great show for binge watching, I absolutely recommend."
1876,"When my best friend told me to watch this, I said - grudgingly - ""I'll give it one episode."" He asked to PLEASE watch 2. Grumble, grumble, grumble. (I'm old: I'm ALLOWED to grumble. You aren't. Not unless you're closing in on 70, too.) Well, the first episode caught me within 10 minutes: a group of boys playing the equivalent of Dungeons and Dragons. They go home, and one boy disappears. Not so unusual so far. But then, it switches to a government lab (natch: located only a couple of miles from the town) and a scientist is running for his life. But who - or what - is he running from? Winona Ryder - barely recognizable - is the mother of two boys, one of whom is part of a group of the 4 boys who are drawn into this mystery when someone shows up at their door. If you want to know more - WATCH IT YOURSELF! The storyline expands so smoothly, the episode is over before you know it. Thats due to excellent - and unforced - scriptwriting that pulls you along. Ryder's unhinged (she was a mental case, as they say, at one point) persona is contrasted by the innocence and completely goodhearted quartet of boys - PLUS ONE. The town sheriff is actually a smart guy, instead of the stereotype of the dumb hick sheriff one frequently sees. And of course, there's the Big, Bad Government who will stop at nothing to locate the ""PLUS ONE."" Just watch it. You will either love it (meaning, if you like good science fiction, it'll grab ya) or you won't, which means you've been watching CW so much, you think that shows like....well, nearly anything on that network, are actually good scriptwriting. Pity if you do. I watched the first two episodes and it's fair to say that, by the time I'd ended the first episode, I thought, ""Well, I can bear to watch the second episode."" And that was my last conscious thought until I found myself bearing down on the end of episode 8. And then it was over and I found myself annoyed because there were no more episodes."
1877,"What a truly enthralling decade the 80's was. I'm truthfully not that into the zeitgeist, but man, was it a paramount era to the history of pop culture. And lately it has been resurrected into much of a contemporary subculture. From Sing Street to the upcoming Ready Player One motion picture, from MGMT to The 1975, mom jeans, hipster glasses—'nostalgia', so say them all, even though for the younger generation, it's mostly an all new trend made out of quirkier, stranger things (pun intended). And none of them fulfills me with the same surge of childish glee The Duffer Brothers' brain child imposes upon me. Stranger Things is a show that captivates my dissipating appetite for jaw- dropping fascinations and strange discoveries. It energizes me with zeals. It has me remember many mood-boosting things: John Hughes movies, Stand By Me (this one, very much), Star Wars (""Lando Calrissian!""), Star Trek (Ryder is Spock's abramsverse mom, c'mon), River Phoenix (Charlie Heaton, anyone?), ET, mutants and superheroes, familiar adorkable geekery and young love. From my inadequate description, you'd think it's a rainbows-and-unicorns kinda thing. It's not. It's a fairly dark sci-fi/thriller. But it's also a lot of pleasant things. A coming-of-age story, a love story, sometimes and more than you know, a comic entertainment. I think it was created with so much passion and enthusiasm that we all get to pass that on. From the flawless soundtrack to the Emmy-worthy production, direction, and performances, I'm all in. I've never seen an ensemble of more talented kids. Millie Bobby Brown gives me the Natalie Portman vibes, the whole package, down to her well-known intelligence. Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin, Noah Schnapp; I'm so in love with these kids that I sound like a pedophile. The Duffers have openly attributed their inspirations to their beloved 80's childhood. They paid homage to the likes of The Clash and Spielberg and Stephen King, and received one hell of endorsements in return. And I'm telling you, hop on and ride the hype. 9/10."
1878,"Where to begin.. I am usually not a big fan of sci-fi, fantasy or the period of time where this show takes place, but Jesus Crist was I pleasantly surprised! I was literally hooked after 10 minutes of this show and watched it all in one sitting. I wont go in to any plot details since I don't wanna risk spoiling even the smallest thing. But what I will do is say that I think this show is close to perfect in just about every way. It's a great and intriguing story, the tempo is perfect, the scenery is fantastic and the characters and acting is easily up there with the best I have ever seen in a movie or series combined. All the characters contribute to the story and I care about every single one of them. The writing is great as well.. It feels like every line and conversation moves the story forward in a well planned way which in my opinion is rare. There is definitely something for everyone in this show.. The mixture of sci-fi, horror, comedy and drama is really quite unique and I would think that it speaks just as well to a 15 year old girl as it did to me a 30 year old man. To sum this up I must give huge props to Netflix. You guys are simply awesome and you really struck gold with this show. I truly hope that season 2 will be just as impressive as the first one.. I will be patiently waiting and watching every other Netflix original in search for the next masterpiece in the meantime."
1879,"I got into this without knowing much about the story but only a sci-fi series. As step by step, you can enjoy the story in a mild pace, not fast and not too slow. The first two o three episodes create a tense atmosphere but as more things are revealed, puzzles are putting together. What surprised me was the performance by the main characters. The arguments among kids, the ignorance, ego, imagination and intelligent define what a pure friendship and brotherhood at the early age. As well as a more complicate teenage period by other main characters. Although I don't remember exactly how I would think in those years but I enjoyed the lines. However, like other drama, there are still some main things are not explained or fully explained. At this point, there are not enough clues for speculations. It would be interested to see how the story would continue. And hope that in the future, the story would not turn into another soap drama for teenagers' love story."
1880,"Stranger Things is really good. Every time I had watched an episode then I immediately wanted to watch the next episode. You get this feeling where you just needs to know what have happened.The actors really did a great job, and especially the children, you could really feel the mood they were in. When they were happy you were and when they were sad you were sad.I am giving it 9 out of 10 stars because i really enjoyed it but i am not giving it 10 stars because I thought there were some parts i really did not understand. It is not because it think it was some bad parts, but I just did not understand them.I can't wait to see how season two is going to be."
1881,"Stranger Things was an absolute blast to watch. As we have come to expect from Netflix, the production side of things was spotless. The show is visually stunning, the score is compelling, and the performances are excellent across the board. However, the writing does suffer from an over-abundance of cliché. Of course, Stranger Things is, at its core, a callback to the classic monster movies of the 80s meaning that much of this cliché is not only forgivable, but even adds to the overall atmosphere of the show.My main problem with this is that the characters were only barely interesting enough to keep me invested in their stories. Again, much of this was intentional, but I feel that it was a bit overdone on the character side of things. We have all seen the alcoholic, loner, cop with a tragic past, the attractive, straight-laced young girl that yearns to break out of her shell despite the protestations of her more sensible friend, and the frustrated kid that sees what is going on, but is ignored by the adults so he takes things into his own hands. With all the other clichés - those of plot, visuals, and music - Netflix used them, but added a layer of production value that elevated them to the next level. However, with character, they are more-or-less tired old reruns of characters we have all seen a thousand times.That being said, Stranger Things is definitely worth the watch. For the most part, it rides the line between familiarity and mystery, and, for all my griping about the characters, I did care enough that I never lost interest in their fates. Were they complex and compelling? No. However, they were good enough. Besides, Stranger Things' calling card is not the writing or the characters. It is not a moving drama or a character study, it is a nostalgic revitalization of an out-dated genre. On this front, the show succeeds admirably. It will not challenge you, nor will it leave you with any lingering emotion, but it does provide 8 hours of some of the most beautiful, thrilling, and binge-able television in recent memory."
1882,"Stranger things has a bunch of interesting moments that are filled with electrical events such as when Joyce tried to communicate with Will in her house and all the Christmas lights flickered, or when she answered the phone and it electrocuted her and broke. Also in the shed when the light bulb flickered during the search. There were many suspenseful moments. One suspenseful moment was when the demogorgon appeared in the house when Nancy and Jonathan were alone. Also when Joyce was in the room trying to communicate with Will and the paint was showing up in order of words. When they found the body in The woods and they thought it was wills. Another exciting/ suspenseful moment was when 11 was in the water tank and she had the dream and the whole building went falling."
1883,"When the monster first appears to kidnap Will, the light bulb in the shed becomes really bright and Will disappears.Also when we first see Hawking lab, we see lights flashing in the hallway when the doctor walks through the hallway.We see Eleven using her power when she stops the fan at Benny restaurant.When the cops go to the shed where Will disappeared, one of the cops turns on the light but the power goes off. After he does that, the light starts to flicker.When the people from the lab go to Benny's, Eleven kills two of the agents by using her telekinesis.Will's mother gets a weird phone call. When the call ends, she gets shocked by electricity.When one of the kids decides to tell the adults about Eleven, she closes the door with her mind.When Will's mom gets a second call, the lights flash and the phone gets electrified and becomes black.After the phone call, music starts playing by itself lights become bright then electricity goes off and the monster appears in Will's house.When Barbara is at the party, her hand is bleeding and some blood drips into the pool and that makes the monster appear in the pool. When the monster comes, all of the lights go off in the pool and then Barbara is in the upside-down.Will mother uses lights to communicate with Will. When he is in the upside down, Eleven uses her power to make things fly.When Mike's mom visits Will's mom, she takes her daughter with her and when Michael sister walks around the house the lights flash next to her and the monster almost gets her.Eleven gets a flashback in which she is using her power to kill guards. After she kills them, she bleeds from her nose.Will's mom uses the Christmas lights to put a alphabet on her wall so she could later use it to communicate.Eleven uses her power so Will could communicate through the talkie.When the kids are at the speech for Will, bullies are making fun of Will. Eleven uses her power to freeze one of the bullies and makes him pee himself.Eleven gets a flashback in which she is using her power to hear things in the other room and when she does that the power goes off. Kids use the machine and Eleven's power at the school to communicate with Will. When they start communicating, Will's mom hears him on the radio and he appears in the wall of her house.After the conversation ends, the machine catches on fire and Eleven bleeds.Eleven gets another flashback in which she is put inside of the salt water so she could enter the upside down.Eleven throws Lucas when they start arguing.Eleven uses her power to increase the distance so that the talkie could be used.They fill a pool with water and salt so Eleven could use generate more power and enter the upside down.Nancy and Will's brother are at Will's house because they want to kill the monster. When the monster comes, the lights flash.Lab people arrive at the school to get Eleven but Eleven kills most of them by the use of her power. She collapses after that.The lights flash and the monster appears and attacks everyone. Eleven kills the monster by the use of her power and she disappears.I really enjoyed the show and I can't wait for the next season."
1884,"Strangers Things is overall a good show, consisting of horror, adventure, and suspense. The cast was absolutely amazing considering how young they were. The show focuses a lot on energy and the power it has in the town of Hawkins. Every time the monster is near it always mess with the electricity around it, for example turning off lights and messing with telephones. Will use the power of energy from the underworld to communicate with his mom, to let her know where he is and to tell her he was alive. She then started buy a lot of Christmas lights and putting them around her house so she can communicate with her son. While this was happening everyone around her started thinking she was insane. When they found wills body, the light didn't stop communicating with Joyce(wills mom) which made her think will was still alive. It turns out the body was fake because the scientist/government have planted it on purpose to attract the attention off of themselves. Hopper(Sheriff) realize that they were the ones who took will or knew something about his disappearance. It turns out everything from will disappearance, the monsters, El (eleven) was all connected to them. The kids Dustin, Eleven, Mike, and Lucas went on their own mission to find will with the help of eleven powers. While looking for will the government was chasing them to get eleven back. The whole show is basically base on the power of energy and science of experimentation. Everyone who's about to be taken all the power around them goes off and when they turn back on, their gone. Although my review is an 9/10 i was still say is a show you want to watch. It could've easily been a solid 10/10 if the show haven't been so predictable and consist of many more horrifying events. Overall i recommend it to everyone, very entertaining and you will feel a since of connections to the characters."
1885,As i watched stranger things i would say this series was excellent and had very good suspenseful Moments. While watching the show i noticed that a lot of energy and electricity was involved with making contacting to friends and family. Energy was used throughout the show because their a girl named eleven that you would eventually meet and she can moving things and use radios. Their a certain part in the show where elevens father tried to make her kill a cat using her energy but she couldn't . Since she couldn't do it her father had her taking away and she ended up hurting the guards.In one part of the show it shows the viewer how these people are brought into the underworld it is also well enough explained how one must get there by creating just enough electricity that nobody not even humans could possibly make. Nancy's friend barb ended up getting dragged there from steves pool and the demogorgon ended up killing her. At the end El used her energy to kill this demogorgon so that everyone else could live. This was a great show and something that i would watch a season 2 of
1886,"I gave 8 because ,i really loved the plot and it made a grasp to my interest that made me expect what will happen next. I would have given 10 , if most background sounds are less audible than the interacting voices.In most places i had to use subtitles to know what they are speaking about because of those background sound.I really liked that young lady who played the ""Eleven"" character, she is beautiful and cute.I hope you would bring her for the next season, i forgot to mention those 4 friends,They kinda interesting,funny in most parts. And i should really say , i am definitely expecting your next season , better make it soon.Best regards ,"
1887,"My daughter in college called me and said ""Mom you have to watch this new show on Netflix."" Her and her boyfriend sat and watched all 8 shows. I looked at it and thought not another alien kid show. My husband and I sat down and was hooked after the first show! We also watched all 8 shows. I liked the fact it was clean. I get so tired of shows basing everything with foul mouths and sex in every other shot. You can let your kids watch it and not worry when you get up for the popcorn that they are going to have their little minds corrupted, But watch out it is spooky, but also funny. I fell in love with all the characters. The only thing I don't like is I have to wait till next year for the show!! UGH!! Good job guys."
1888,"Yes, i like! Very much! Didn't expect it was so good. I am hooked. WhatI don't like are the scary parts. Not a big fan of scary stuff. I like the science-fiction, the 80s, the soundtrack, the mystery. Well written, well directed. Very good cast. AND that it is ""inspired and aesthetically informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Stephen King, Robert Zemeckis and George Lucas, among others."" (wikipedia) Just cool to watch, I just forget everything around me and am 100% focused on what happens. So GREAT =) I want this series to last for at least more than ## seasons. Thers is so much potential to so it could last for so much more seasons than the first end the scond that is coming in spring of 2017. Please let it last!!! THANX"
1889,"I found this series on Netflix not so long ago, at first I wasn't quite sure whether or not I liked it. It was a bit hard to follow at the beginning, but by the third episode I was caught. There were a few times when I wasn't sure what was going on. But, I must admit, I love it and wish season two was on Netflix.The story line is original and I find myself very intrigued to find out what happens next. I have also found myself contemplating what might happen.I would recommend this to anyone who loves supernatural or mystery orientated shows.And one request: Netflix, please release season two!"
1890,"The only thing missed was Michael Knight and his trans-am. The creators did a tremendous job capturing the aura of an era, I don't think I can contribute with something about this series that it hasn't been told yet, It's hard for me to give an honest evaluation because it makes you nostalgic since the intro,so I found my self emotionally compromised, the setting is just amazing.They did a great cast selection,it's the first time in a very long that I don't find the acting-kids annoying, the only thing I can complain of is that it could have been more suspense's scenes, but in my opinion we have another great and laudable piece by our friends of Netflix."
1891,"Dungeons & Dragons, Eggo Waffles, Winona Ryder in Mom Jeans, Super Powers, and More in Netflix's 'Stranger Things'!'Stranger Things' Season 1 is The Hit Show of The Summer!What can I say about Netflix's hit original series Stranger Things that hasn't already been said? I know I am a little late to the party. But, Stranger Things is one of the best Netflix original series you should definitely be watching! If you were a child of the 1980s, or if you simply are a fan of the films of the 1980s, Netflix's new series Stranger Things will satisfy you, entertaining you, creep you out, and overall it's a blast!This thrilling Netflix original stars award-winning actress Winona Ryder (Beetlejuice, Edward Scissorhands) as Joyce Byers, who lives in a small Indiana town with her older son in 1983. When Joyce's 12-year-old son, Will, played by Noah Schnapp (Bridge of Spies) goes missing, she launches an investigation with the local police chief Jim Hooper, played by David Harbour (The Equalizer, A Walk Among the Tombstones) into his disappearance. As they search for answers, they unravel a series of extraordinary mysteries involving secret government experiments, and unnerving supernatural forces. Meanwhile, Will's three friends are also determined to find him when they find a scared girl, played by Millie Brown (2014s Intruders television show) who calls herself Eleven (after the numeric tattoo on her arm) and possesses supernatural abilities. Okay for starters, let's talk about the characters. You care what happens to ALL the characters in Stranger Things, because they're written authentically and they're cast exceptionally, especially when it comes to the kids. The kids come off as real kids, and what real kids would do in these types of situations. Brown, makes Eleven scary, sad, funny and sweet, especially in scenes shared with the other kids. I believe she is the breakout star in this series. Gaten Matarazzo's Dustin, may be short on teeth but long on hilarious dialogue, and grew on me with each episode. As did Ryder, the chief of police, the kids, and all the characters. You want to see these characters proved right, you want them to seek justice, and you want the underdogs to win. Every character is so well written and rounded, that I found myself emotionally connecting to every single character.From the moment Stranger Things begins, you can feel the influences that have guided series creators Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer (Wayward Pines). The film is flooded with '80s nostalgia. To me, this feels like a Stephen King book. That have would have become a movie, directed by Steven Spielberg or John Carpenter (or both!). Obviously, the risk is that this could all just feel like a tribute that's fun, but with no real identify of its own. However, Stranger Things manages to create a compelling world of its own, centered on a group of very relatable, likable characters, an interesting story, and entertaining. Style over Substance?Even though this series takes place in the '80s, it takes more place in the movies of the 80s. Meaning, this ""real"" world that we're watching feels more like a '80s film we would have watched. One small complaint I have is the story could have been just a little bit more original. It's cool the show has all these cool little Easter eggs to the '80s. However, some of the things that happen in the series, you will know it from other iconic '80s films. Such as, films like E.T. The Goonies, and Carrie. T his show isn't just for fans of the '80s and people who grew up in that era. I feel like this is a series everyone can enjoy. Even though I am curious to what today's youth audience would think of this film. Would they enjoy and respect the series like some of the older viewers? So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on Netflix's original series Stranger Things season one. It's an interesting blend of horror, comedy, drama, science fiction, nostalgia, and I believe this series is extremely well done. It is something you can watch alone, by yourself, over again, and there is something here for everyone. I believe Stanger Things season one earns a9/10!And just like a Christmas present I'm gonna wrap this up. Until next time, this review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you all for reading and or viewing, and I hope you all have an amazing day as always. Peace out. :)"
1892,"Fantastic show, I could break it down, launch into a whole series of theories, comparisons to like movies and spoilers; but I'll spare everyone. I will say I love the fact it's not just the kids, all ages get involved in the mystery.Well done to the Duffer Brothers and to Netflix for making this happen. GREAT acting, Winona who knew! The kids, Harbour, Modine, wow, awesome casting and work by the cast! If you've not seen the first season, be prepared to binge as it's hard to stop watching.Thank you Netflix and Duffers, can't wait to see what's next and I can't wait for Season 2!!!"
1893,"Stranger Things, is the series that's so simple yet intelligently made that when you have to explain it in words to friends it sounds so complex! This is the show which anyone can understand! Young adults e.g. 16 upwards to people the age of 40+ can all understand and reference different things inside the show! This summer i was debating between watching either Stranger Things or Narcos and lets just say i've been able to start Narcos! I finished Stranger Things in 2 days! This show keeps you hooked constantly and leaves you becoming a character inside the show, the viewer can relate to any character in every episode!All in all this show is a masterpiece from Netflix! Let's just say AMC and other series creators have some serious standards now, Netflix keep up the good work!"
1894,"Stranger Things is a lot of things. It's a series about monsters; a science fiction story about secret government testing; it's about a mother searching for her missing son and dealing with grief; it's the awkward teen romance; it's also a story about childhood friendship. At its heart though, this is a show about childhood and adolescence. When you are growing up, a young person's life revolves around the small world he/she creates for him/herself. One doesn't think about the hard realities or question the boundaries of what is and isn't possible. And Stranger Things really excels at taking you back and making you experience that childhood nostalgia. I often felt, that I was watching an X-Files episode, Super 8, or a Spielberg movie.Usually in family oriented TV shows revolving around adults and kids, what ends up happening is that the story is often told from the perspective of the parents'. ""We,""the audience, experience the kids through the lens of their parents, or any other adults in the story. We see the hardships and joy adults face dealing with kids. But, here, radically enough for 8 episodes, the three kids in the story Lucas, Dustin, and Mike are in charge of their own world. They are legitimate, willful agents of their own story. Their parents are at best bystanders; sometimes watching the antics with disinterest or mild frustration, and other times wholly ignorant of the adventures these kids go through.One never doubts, that Stranger Things is a story of the kids, as they unravel the mystery of their missing friend Will, and make a new friend with Eleven. The adults exist in the minds of the kids' in the murky periphery; not always as allies or confidantes, in fact the adults are only vaguely visible, coming in and out of focus.For more visit www.artspeaksy.com"
1895,"I hope this is renewed.Lots of great writing and premises. But a little over acted and dramatic. Too much yelling. The adults could act little more like mature adults.Love the strong women characters. But am troubled by what happens to a stereotypical fat girl. Why do blacks always die and get crucified all the time? Why are fat people vilified? Very X-Files, Spielberg and Stephen King in flavor. Needs a few more creative twists instead of leaning on what has been done before. Duffer Bros. make your mark in a new way."
1896,"While I think this show is pretty good, it had things going on that left a bad taste in my mouth after the hype and excitement of seeing it had waned.1.- What were those experiments they were trying before 11 was born? What was their purpose? 2.- What were they trying to accomplish with eleven? They clearly stumbled upon the ""upside down world"" and the thing inside it, but what were they hoping to accomplish then? 3.- Why was the thing unaware of how to enter this world until eleven made her presence felt? The monster started opening portals left and right once it knew where the other world was. 4.- Why wasn't there any evidence of the monster opening a hole in the house's wall when it scared the mom?"
1897,"Stranger Things is a witty, affectionate and nostalgic look back at the 80s horror/brat pack movie. Geeky kids on a mission to rescue their friend, adults who are deliberately colourless or non-existent parents (Winina Ryder excepted) or alternatively evil men in suits. Hazmat or business, suits are not to be trusted. White coats are also to be avoided. And avoid they do - on bikes of course - with a little help from a special power. Sound familiar? The parallels with ET are obvious but references to cult 80s movie abound - the evil force in the parallel universe (Poltergeist), the search that follows the train tracks (Stand by Me), the jock vs geek teen love interest (Heathers, Pretty in Pink) and maybe a nod to the smoky hallway finale in Assault on Precinct 13. Stranger Things is an entertaining ride - just the right amount of shock - and the kids as main protagonists is engaging without being cringe worthy. No doubt some will point out that kids avoiding baddies on bikes is unlikely and unrealistic, that no one can hide a superpower in their basement den for days on end without the parents knowing. Well, they did it in the 80s so it must be possible and frankly who cares if it's not. It was fun. If this was the 80s the soundtrack album would be a killer - The Clash, Echo and the Bunnymen, Joy Division, New Order. A thoroughly enjoyable trip down memory lane and an affectionate punch (look it up)."
1898,"I want to write a review on how amazingly this show is executed. It felt like I am watching a classic 80's film. Every single detail was hit to perfection. There are some flaws with the show and there aren't but a couple of characters of which you'd care. It's cliché and predictable but none of that matters. The opening credits are so pulled from the influences that I actually felt like I was back 30 years ago watching something fresh. It's boring and you really don't give a crud about any of the characters, but you still watch it. To me, that's an amazing accomplishment. David Hauser and Winona Ryder KILL IT!! The other characters you either hate or just tolerate. Regardless, for something I actually disliked watching, for the sheer genius of execution, I give a solid 10!!"
1899,"I've now watched the first 4 or 5 eps of this new Netflix orig. mini- series (I think?), and, like the 2011 film ""Super 8"", this really put me in the mind of a lot of things that came out in the late '70s/early '80s, including some of Spielberg's concoctions. At it's heart, it's a missing child case (like ""E.T."" was about a boy dealing with divorce), but the bigger picture seems to involve a whole slew of things- secret government operatives, experimentation, monsters, possibly aliens-??- not sure about that so far, but wow this show keeps you on the edge of your seat!"
1900,"Funny, exciting, thrilling, dramatic, shocking, emotional, beautiful and so much more"
1901,100% recommend watching for someone who like any genre
1902,"Just finished season three and it just keeps getting better! I couldn't of asked or expected more. The story, characters, setting, soundtrack, cinematography, and writing are all first class. Every character is likeable and interesting in their own way. Best of all it feels like an 80's Horror/Sci-Fi/Action movie and all of it's nods to it's classic predecessors are incredibly enjoyable. We can finally stop saying ""They don't make them like they used to"". I can't wait to see what the Duffer Brothers do next. Their love for the genre is clear and their execution is outstanding."
1903,"All three seasons, loved it. Great story, cast, visuals, special effects - just a great show."
1904,"Everything is bigger, better, wilder, crazier, happier but also so much more sad.A 100% the best season yet, and I want at least 2 seasons more. Let's go!!!"
1905,"It started with a good start and by episode 3 it started to get even better, i didn't even feel those episodes it was so fun to watch , and MIND-BLOWING throughout the whole thing
I Highly recommend watching It !! ENJOYYYY"
1906,Totally waste of time! No point from the while TV show!
1907,"Gotta say, I'm extremely surprised of the nose dive Stranger Things took after 3-4 good episodes. Not a fan of the Lost/Stephen King school of mystery crap where you don't have to explain anything. That's super lazy. I called out Lost after five episodes into season one. This after reading heaps of Stephen King books during the 80- 90's. Dean R Koontz is above King in my opinion (Read Twilight Eyes or Whispers). He always provides an explanation to his mysteries and they are always amazing. In hindsight, this show was a letdown. But the kid actors were amazing. Especially the toothless one. What a star! Writing and humour was excellent also. And that Carpeterish soundtrack, lovely...I feel Lando'd by this show."
1908,"This Epic Netflix series is well epic
It has a good story line with loveable characters.
It starts of with a boy that goes missing and there friends need to find him. On the way they meet a girl named Eleven who has telekinesis and powers like that. They soon get a big team and fight the mind flayer.
The final fight was epic
just perfect
I fell in love the moment I saw it.
I do find that the episodes are a bit extended (45 min each)
that is the only flaw.
But I still love it, I would recommend it if you re looking for something on NetflixI want to see season 4!!!"
1909,Its the most watched season out of the 3 seasons so what i don't understand is how can people say its bad if people are obviously watching it more than the first 2 seasons. Iv watched it more than the first 2 seasons if i wanna watch stranger things ill binge watch it or just watch season 3
1910,... one of the best shows on Netflix. End of discussion.
1911,"Just finished season 3 and this show continues to amaze me. Its hard for me to get into tv shows now a days, but stranger things is so well done I could not stop watching. Ignore the bad reviews! I've learned that if anyone can give a show of this caliber below a 5, its just some loser who probably hates there life so they need something else to hate on. Im no director or do I know exactly what it takes to make a tv show, but I do know a lot of work is involved and for people to rate something like this a 3 is mentally ill."
1912,"No other words to describe it. Slow starter, but once it runs, it runs. And how! Thank you, Netflix. Forever hooked"
1913,"Watched - STRANGER THINGS: SEASON 3 - it's really fascinating how the Duffer Brothers keep repeating the formula, come back with the same kind of revenge storyline (with a few tweaks), paying homage to sci-fi/horror back in the eighties, with all the branding and nostalgic reminders that take viewers back to those good old days. And it all seems to fit together and wow us again every time and this third outing is no different.The story has been upped a notch since the characters have matured slightly, they're still pretty much kids but exploring teenage feelings and relationships. This tale includes 'the Russians' (as they're referred to) covertly coming to Hawkins to exploit the portal to the Upside Down. This somehow unleashes the Mind Flayer (or the Demogorgon) and before long our group of friends find themselves putting on their detective caps, piecing together disappearances and odd events before confronting their common enemy head on.Stranger Things is still so damn good because of its exceptional cast (both Main and Supporting). The chemistry between these individuals is phenomenal, their acting prowess is big enough for the big screen.It's such an amazing show with a fantastic ending + a mid credits scene that sets the climax for the fourth and final season, can't wait - 10/10#netflix, #strangerthings, #demagorgon, #upsidedown, #mindflayer, #flayed, #hopper, #eleven"
1914,I don't usually write reviews but I had to give this show ten stars
1915,"Stranger Things is amazing from season One, to season two and three, they keep making it better every time.
I highly recommend Anyone binge watch this as it will get you hooked."
1916,I dunno what all the hate is about on S3 - there were just tons of awful 80's anti-soviet films and this season sorta felt like one. I liked the Sheriff in this season!
1917,"First of all, I must congratulate Duffer Brothers for creating something apparently original, and to package and present it so beautifully. Stranger Things is nothing but a perfect mixture of various old and new movies and tv series.The most obvious imitation is of course The Goonies. This 80s classic written by none other than Spielberg laid the foundation of these super intelligent kids and their adventures.The consistent funny backdrop around the horrors and monsters remind you about the Ghostbusters (1984) periodically.Then there is of course X-Men. The inhuman powers of El and Kali surely take you back to the gang of Charles Xavier and Magneto.The peculiar and nasty looking creatures from the other dimension very much look like those from Resident Evil, so does the closed door trapped suspense scenes where those creatures and goons are following you.And you cannot ignore the resemblance of Stranger Things and Dark, a German TV series also from Netflix. The problem of Stranger Things is that the evil scientists played with a portal to other dimension, and in Dark they decided to have fun with time travel. Both in a similar happy and small town neighborhood.Looking at those poor Flayed humans in season 3, and also Will in season 2, you cannot help but remembering about Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978).John Carpenter surely inspired the Duffer Brothers a lot from The Thing (1982).And you could easily go on and on.However, to be fair, Stranger Things definitely deserve your applauds for a superbly light weight, funny and intelligent ride with occasional anxious moments and some basic lessons of science. But all these were in season 1 and 2.
In season 3, unfortunately the Brothers could not invent new stories and plots at all. All the episodes and events that took place in season 3 feels like some sort of repetition from earlier episodes. Only new trick (or, surprise) was those Russian goons and their secret operations. It was more surprising to see that big of a Russian operation and scientific base beneath a mall in all American soil, then to opening a portal to another dimension. Not sure, was building of such a gigantic base in America was that easy during 80s (given that Stranger Things is plotted in 1980s)? And man, that so-called Russian bouncer, trying so hard to be Arnold Schwarzenegger! In absence of actual and provocative events in season 3, we can see more funny stuff and comedy scenes, many of them feel like forcefully inserted and hence dragging. Nothing new from El, nor from those lovely little bright kids, nor from the creature off the other dimension.But full marks to all the actors in all the 3 seasons. Brilliantly executed. My favorites though are David Harbour as Jim Hopper and Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin Henderson. And the worst being Natalia Dyer as Nancy Wheeler and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan Byers. The ""fat rambo"" David has literally carried most of the series on his shoulders alone, along with the kids. The production value and CGI are as you find in a standard Hollywood production house. Nothing exceptional, nor very bad.
As expected, season 4 will come with the demogorgons still alive and kicking in some remote area in Russia, and they would take human form also. I would be excited to see that, only if they can think of some new scientific accidents and incidents, rather than petty humors and out-of-context american-russian rivalry."
1918,It's a best TV show in the world I love the characters so much and I so excited to next season stranger things 10/10
1919,"8.9????? Come on, people. This is a show for kids. Yes, great actors, kids including but 8.9????? Did we watch the same show?"
1920,"Interesting mix of styles, quite watchable with minor fast-forward;) But c'mon now, why there are so many ugly artists? It should have emphasize something? They had increased concentration of them in 80s? Laughable and made a lot of scenes hard to believe, in terms of acting. Overall feels more like kids movie. It is not Steven King, folks. Lower your expectations. PS: nice OST."
1921,"I'm sure you don't need a full blow-by-blow account as hundreds have provided that already. So, I'll keep it simple.I'm a child of the 80's and Stranger Things threw me down memory lane with a jolt. It embraces all we did and all we were: the hair, the music, the arcade games, the friendship, the young love. And, of course, the awesome movies that inspired this amazing show. Truth be told, I wasn't sold on Series 1 and did struggle on occasion, although I ultimately enjoyed it. I'd have rated it a 7-8 out of 10. Then I watched Season 2 and was blown away. It surpasses its predecessor at every turn and converted me into a drooling addict until the final minute. Now, I'm already pumped for Season 3!In summary, do yourself a favour and watch this show. Best of all, there's no gratuitous violence, sex or language so it can be easily watched with your suitably-aged children. Watch it now, you'll be glad you did."
1922,"I really enjoyed this show right up until they went into having the overtly white red haired girl with the black kid. This would not even have been a culturally acceptable thing back in the 70's, and it reflects the medias ongoing agenda of promoting black man/white woman relationships only. I particularly take offense at the fact that they made the girls choice based on the black kid being more sensitive and talkative than the geeky and less attractive white kid, showing an obvious competition between the races for the white girl. I mean why was his black sister not portrayed with one of his white friends? This is ANOTHER in a very obvious ploy to influence young people into thinking a particular type of mixed relationship is preferable. I really take offense that the media is pushing this so hard on all fronts."
1923,Cry like a baby in the end. Congrats Duffer's brother.
1924,Second season was ok. But this third killed it mowma.
1925,"No words, I really loved it, the story line, the cast, the 80's theme, the paradox between childhood and adulthood, just staggering. I have watched many movies, many series, for me this one is without a doubt the best by far, I mean by like a gigantic margin.
please o please make at least another 8 or 9 seasons. No seriously, I mean it !!
Thanks everyone who was in anyway involved in the process of creating this masterpiece."
1926,It's so good that I love it to watch am eating the new season
1927,"I watched the first episode, and I couldn't have been less impressed. Poor acting, bad scripts, annoying actors, this show has it all! I went in wanting to enjoy this show, but I hated every minute of it. I regret that I had to give this show any score at all, because I would have preferred to give it 0."
1928,"Season 1: Extremely tight writing and all the characters are likable.Season 2: Writing a bit loose and Mike is annoyingly selfish and cruel.Season 3: Mike isn't that good of a character. Amazing visuals and perfectly made to look like the 80's. Also good writing, better than season 2. Bad fake out death scene.All in all, excited to see where they are going and also really hoping that they are not gonna bring Him back cu of the fans."
1929,"If you love ,The Goonies , Napoleon Dynamite and An evening with Beverley Luff Linn then you'll find all your favourite misfits here but with a touch of the X files. What's not to like. Season 1 class, season 2 ok, season 3 , outstanding."
1930,Netflix really nailed it with stranger things such a masterpiece!!!
1931,"Season 1 was a shock for me, it was like the 1st matrix movie, briliant and unexpected. I rated it best TV show of 2016, before Game of Thrones or Westworld, and I stick to my choice even now.
However, season 2 and 3 were ...well, like Matrix 2 and 3, more, but ultimately less, ...a lot less.
Humans, in general, seem to work on two things: something, and money.
With Stranger Things the feeling is that for the 1st season they were really doing something, while for the latter they were just making money."
1932,"Here is my thoughts on season 3 and some tangents from it.
New season is wonderfool, there are some goofs , that are just obvious errors, but they does not spoil experience. What spoiled though is that one of new characters is lesbian. I am completly fine with LGBT representation, when it is not stuffed in your face and done right. My complain here to writers that established a relationship between her and a male character and you root for them to be together and then she is comming out as a lesbian. So all that build up is ruined.
What was the point then? Ok, fine. But IMHO better solution is to show us a lesbo couple, new female cast that represents homosexual relationship. Or even better, leave this heroine be interested in girls, but also boys. If she is bisexual then it is a win win situation.
The serial works as a detective, sci-fi and a horror story, but then creators make some flaws that could be easily avoided if they would change just a little bit of chacacter development.
P.S. I am not a homophob nor I a SJW. As I said all people should be represented, but authors have to do it right."
1933,Zo good series my favoriete character is millie Bobby brown as eleven
1934,I'll be honest I was giving up on this show after the 1st two episodes of the third season but my God I'm so glad I didn't. The season starts off pretty slowly with two episodes dedicated to reintroducing the characters. But once episode 3 comes on stranger things goes back to its roots of the 1st season and you'll find yourself watching the next 5 episodes in one sitting. The writing and acting is absolutely sensational with Lucas's sister Erica stealing the show with her humor. This is by far the best season of the show as it has the best humor best action and best emotional scenes. Basically ignore all the bad reviews as they clearly don't appreciate character development eg you cant expect Mike to be the same Mike from the 1st season! 10 out of 10
1935,"The Duffer brothers nailed it again! It was everything funny, scary, sad, classic and lots of more. It made up for the two years that we had to wait for..... It was defentily the most saddest season of all, I'm still in my bedroom thinking of what I just saw. This season you will leave with a lot of un answered questions as well. BUT the acting! It was beyond the most impressive thing I've ever seen and my favorite actress is Audrey Hepburn. When Billy (Dacre) and El (Millie) were on screen together, guys I had tears in my on how good it was.The story was everything I never was took my eyes of the screen because I was so interested on what happening in front of me. My favorite eposides this season was 4, the ending! 7 and 8 you'll have to watch to find out...."
1936,"Wow, okay, admittedly, I overlooked this and, I guess you could say avoided this show for three years? That's absurd. I decided to give it a go because many people love it and because just the other day there my nephew was watching Netflix mainly so he could catch up with Stranger Things -- upon telling me that Season 3 had just been added. I decided to give it a go, for the second time. I had seen literally one episode, the pilot, about three years ago or something. Or perhaps a little short of three years. Anyhow, I am certainly glad I gave it another go. Three episodes in, I was absolutely hooked! Now, I knew I was going to like it more considering this time when I watched the pilot episode, I actually really enjoyed it. Its writing is really good, a lot better than I thought it would be, and I think its characters are both very likeable and well-written -- well-acted too, for that matter. I like the fact the show is pretty dark in tone, but not overly-done to the point where it's gothic-esque. I find myself very indulged and captivated as I watch more of this series, and am so glad I gave it another go. Highly recommend it to anybody who's yet to see it, and for anybody who might have been on my position, and you're unsure of it or haven't gave it a go beyond maybe the first episode, I strongly suggest you give it at least three to four episodes. Really good show with a lot to offer, a lot going on and lots of thrills and thought-provoking sci-fi horror drama along the way.."
1937,"The 1980s, that certain age, small town, government secrets, synth. It's the best."
1938,"Some people are hating on this season. I loved it. Every season just keeps rolling. From the overprotective dad of eleven, to the almost romance of the sheriff. It brings back the 80s from z cavaricci pants to the swatch watch. There's Orange Julius and wicks and things. Duffer brother knows the 80s! I'm glad that the sheriff seems to survive the explosion."
1939,Look what you can do Netflix when you leave identity politics out of your product. When you stop trying to force everyone around you to think like you do. You make a show like Stranger Things. Season one was great. You almost screwed season 2 up with that idiotic crew that was there for absolutely no reason (identity politics). Thank good we never saw them again. But season 3 was just perfect. Thank you.
1940,"I wanna thank the brothers for this tv-show
And i wanna thank Eleven for this"
1941,"This is one of those TV series that deserves it's well publicised hype. Smart, sometimes funny, sometimes dark, running the gamut of emotions guided by engaging actors, acting, plot, twists and turns, music, photography direction and so on. This show really is something special, one of those shows where creative freedom was given to create a comprehensive aesthetic of sight, sound and thought, and we the audience are deeply rewarded because of it. Others in my family find some parts confronting, some parts confusing, but all agree there is a spirit, depth and engagement to the story-telling made strong by a coherent creative vision that exudes quality in every aspect. For me, watchable and re-watchable. This show is really something special."
1942,"The beauty of the show has always been the interaction of the characters with the mystery and creepy stuff in the background. In this season they brought the creepy stuff to the foreground without any mystery and simplified the character interactions... 9 out 10 for show overall, but this season knocks it out of the 10 out of 10 range."
1943,"Best show, best acting and I would recommend this to everyone and anyone."
1944,"Amazing show, Amazing environment, Amazing cast, soundtrack everything is amazing and entertaining"
1945,"Some people criticize this season because of the bad russians, children infiltrating a super secret base... Have you seen any of the child 80s movies? ET?! The Goonies?! ALL of them feature children doing impossible things. Have you heard about Cold War??? In all 80s movies the russians were the bad guys! Red Dawn? Rambo III? Rocky IV???? Come on, have you seen the russian doctor in Stranger Things?? He is the most stereotyped bad guy ever and he's just FANTASTIC!!! I looks like he was just out of Castle Wolfenstein!That's what we in the 80s wanted to see. Stranger Things is just an 80s over muscled tv series made in 201Xs. And it is just fantastic. I loved 3rd season even more than the 2nd. 10 out of 10!"
1946,"This show has grown so much since the beginning. It gets better each season and season 3 was the BEST one by far! So much detail with the 1980's in season 3, way more than previous seasons. I believe some might be due to the kids are now teens and all the character development even way more in season 3. This show is worth the Netflix subscription defiantly! We all had to wait nearly two years for season 3 and I can see why now. So much more to it all the way around. Great show even better last season, season 3! And it was renewed for season 4. Pay attention to the last episode and watch the credits. Not giving away why but it is important."
1947,"This throws you back in time and keeps things colorful and interesting, has great humor, thrills and cool cgi. Pretty good blend between quirk, fun and a sci-fi almost-horror type show. Acting is also incredibly solid.Season 3 was pretty amazing in my opinion mostly due to it's pacing, it had Game Of Thrones type split scenes with different people in different places, keeping you interested as the episode cuts from scene to scene, it all slowly comes together leading to a pretty satisfying ending and a taste for more."
1948,"Acting, setting, atmosphere and story was absolutely top notch as per the other seasons.The con I mentioned... too many references and placements for Coke (along with some others). Netflix has the money coming in from their network and shouldn't need to pander to other corporations!One other tiny negative. Star Wars was still Star Wars in the 80s!"
1949,"The transition in each scene is as original as it gets, the psychological evolution of each character perfectly balanced, and the diversity in emotions makes it really easy to absorb. Furthermore, the sheer amount of unpredictable moments makes this series not only entertaining but sincerely satisfying to watch. They got everything right; sound background, scenery , costumes, special effects (handled tastefully), visual effects... Amazing production overall !Hats off."
1950,"🎼Never ending storyyyyyy aaaahhh ahhhh🎼Iconic scene, you guys know what im on about"
1951,"I love this show and have. I believe I might already have a review on here but I'm writing just because the CRAZINESS that Uma's daughter literally has her same voice. ::cray::::
That's all.
If you don't like this show you're ridiculous."
1952,"Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreamsMake believe I'm everywhere
Given in the light
Written on the pages
Is the answer to a never ending story
Ah"
1953,"I was scared that another season would ruin the whole series, but fortunately, it didn't. Watching it was a pleasure despote this season has a total different vibe. Every episode thrills you every second, like the other seasons. I just couldn't stop watching and finished the whole ss in 1 day lmao"
1954,"If you are guy who love to watch horror, sci-fi, mystery shows or movies then you are definitely gonna love this series, it's full of suspense whenever you finish episode you will think about next episode and you will start assuming by your own, it's so much interested, just watch it."
1955,"Stranger Things is another by-the-numbers action series that continues Hollywood's subversive attacks on America's cultural heritage of personal responsibility. It has always amazed me how a morally-bankrupt Hollywood (as if the current outcry against sexual harassment among its Leftist elite is anything new) has any credibility at all when it points its slimy finger at the other side of the political aisle. If this was a show for adults, I would let it slide (it's called toleration), but this show targets kids and that makes it wrong.I will admit that the 1st season is not as bad as the 2nd season; the producers must've decided an edgy approach would help sustain the ratings.Parents, here are some of the ""cool things"" you can expect to find in Stranger Things Season 2:[1.] kids swearing all the time [2.] adults (and 1 kid) smoking all the time [3.] clueless parents [4.] sexual adventures without a hint of morality (in real life, this ""fun"" leads to STDs, teenage pregnancy, and abortion) [5.] an ""enlightened"" Communist encouraging high school teenagers to drink vodka and fornicate [6.] justifying stealing because the rich are ""insured,"" and implying it is good to steal from the rich ... I could go on and on.Every generation has to fight an uphill battle against the inherent depravity inside all of us. TV shows like this are dangerous because of the glitter that attracts children and then implants destructive ideas in their mind. Before you know it, a gullible citizenry will be electing leaders that can't balance a budget, who lie all the time (""if you like your plan, you can keep it""), and who look to government to underwrite all of society's social ills."
1956,"Show about eleven breaking out of her mental ward where she is abused and she meets up with the boys and they try to protect her from the bad men, btw mike and eleven have a thing"
1957,Stranger things is a massive series. Stranger things make severe heart beat. Once again the NETFLIX give a ultimate series. The giant NETFLIX always give a best of everything
1958,"Stranger things is outstanding series.
Every episode make severe heart beat.
Once again NETFLIX give a massive series.
the giant NETFLIX always give the best of everything."
1959,"Season 1 Review: I absolutely loved how these characters were written in. First off, Mike is a pretty good person to be around, even though he might get mad a few times. Dustin is the best character, with his funny comments and lovable personality. Lucas is pretty smart, but mostly uses those smarts against his friends, like having Eleven taken out of the group. Will, even though we don't see him much, is just an innocent boy who tries his best to hide from the Demogorgon and contact his mother. And Eleven is such an awesome person, not just because of her powers, but because she'll do anything to protect her friends. They're all really great and played by such amazing actors. Same goes for the other main characters, including Joyce, Jonathan, Nancy, Hopper, & Steve.One of my favorite scenes was when Steve yells at his friends for being jerks. There's always your standard bully in a movie or show, and they rarely change their act. But for Steve to go from this sex-loving, fighting jock to someone who wants to make up for it is just one of the best character development scenes in this show. Another scene I loved is when Joyce argues with Lonnie about him only staying with her so that he could get lawsuit money for Will's ""death"". This scene was really well acted by Joyce's actress, Winona Ryder, and Lonnie's actor, Ross Partridge. The emotion really comes from Joyce, where she yells about Lonnie about his lawsuit plans, being a bad father, not even knowing where Jonathan would like to go to collage, and how he thinks she's crazy about thinking that Will is still alive. It's a real highlight of the series, including the quite from Joyce, ""Maybe I am a mess! Maybe I'm... crazy! Maybe I'm out of my mind! But God help me, I will keep these lights up until the day I die if I think there's a chance that Will's still out there!""Season 2 Review: Another great season for this amazing series. We get to physically see more of Will in this season, and had that great arcade scene with Devo's ""Whip It"" playing at the beginning. We also get some new characters: Max, Billy, Erica, Murray, Bob, & Dr. Owens. I was pretty disappointed when they introduced a new stereotypical bully character, Billy, back in this series. But as I watched more of the season, I realized that Billy was more than just a stereotype. His violent nature and bad attitude adds to the tension of this season, including towards the end, when he beats up Steve after he finds out his step-sister, Max, is at Will's house and Steve tries to protect her and the other kids. Speaking of Max, she is a great character, too. At first, she was a little edgy and didn't really like Mike, Dustin, Lucas, & Will. But when she came around, she was a pretty great person.Some scenes I enjoyed were the arcade, Hopper & Eleven's big fight, Kali making Eleven see Dr. Brenner, & the cabin ""exorcism"". I already stated that the arcade scene was good because of the song that starts it, but I also liked Will's ""episode"" that he has while he and the boys play games. The intensity of the red storm is great, and Noah Schnapp (Will) does great acting in this scene. Hopper & Eleven's big fight was a highlight of mine because of the emotional value it has. They had a few fights before, but this one was the big one. When Eleven gets back to the cabin after she goes to see Mike, Hop is waiting outside, and he grounds her for being out. But when he starts taking the TV away, Eleven starts using her powers to keep it in place, and eventually Hop rips the electrical cord away and the TV turns off. Eleven and Hopper yell at each other, and then Eleven locks herself in her room. When Hopper yells from the other side of the door, Eleven screams in emotion and makes the windows shatter. More great acting from Millie Bobby Brown (Eleven) and David Harbour (Hopper). This scene was great in a lot of ways.When Kali makes Eleven see Dr. Brenner and says that he's alive, Eleven goes into another emotional breakdown. This scene was another intense, but emotional, one. With Eleven trying to deny that he's still alive, it really makes you feel bad for her, as Dr. Brenner was not the nicest person in the world. And the final scene I wanna talk about is the cabin ""exorcism"". I call it an exorcism because you can't deny that it has that feel to it, with Joyce, Jonathan, & Nancy trying to get the Mind Flayer out of Will. It's a scene that makes you think if Will is gonna make it or not, because with him screaming and Joyce trying to make the fire warmer, it feels like a 50/50 chance for his survival.Season 3 Review: Probably my favorite season out of the series so far. Season 3 takes a turn on being mainly on supernatural beings to partially about evil Russians. It still has the Mind Flayer, though, but this time not just a windy being. Again, some new characters were introduced in this series. Erica, who was partially in Season 2, Robin, a really cool coworker of Steve's, Heather, a fellow lifeguard with Billy, Larry Kline, the town mayor, Dr. Alexei, the lovable Russian scientist, and Suzie, Dustin's girlfriend. Being a Saw fan, I'm really stoked about Mayor Kline, who was played by Cary Elwes. If you didn't know, Elwes played a huge part in the Saw franchise, and I'm so glad he was in this great show.If I piss you off, I'm sorry, but one of my favorite scenes from this season was Dustin and Suzie's duet. I know that a lot of people don't really enjoy this scene because it comes out of nowhere and feels very forced. And even though I agree with some of these claims, you have to admit, Gaten Matarazzo (Dustin) and Gabriella Pizzolo (Suzie) can really sing. Also, I bet you agree with me about which scene was the most tragic in this season. It's definitely Dr. Alexei's death, who was such a great character, but had to die sadly. It brings me back to when other likable characters were killed, like Barb from Season 1 and Bob from Season 2. Who else agrees?"
1960,I loved it since the beginning. I absolutely love the storyline. It creates this type of a background where the viewer is extremely fascinated to find out what happens next. plus the cast is full of great actors. Honestly it was amazing and I would defenitely recommend it.
1961,"Amazing story binge watched all three seasons, it was one of my favorite shows of all time to watch. Was skeptical at first"
1962,"Stranger Things is a rousing 80s experience. And at the heart of it - It's stellar cast and unique story. From it's mystery unravelling in Season 1 to it's Gut-wrenching and binge-worthy Seasons 2 and 3. Stranger Things is a show that has it all. It has Horror Elements, comedy, Drama. It is a show that takes you back to the 80s, with the costumes and the way its written, to it's hundreds and hundreds of 80s movie references. Stranger Things is a show for everyone to enjoy."
1963,"Stranger Things is a very enjoyable show.
Everyone says that it is a throwback to the 80s and I agree, it's very simple and just fun.
If you've read other reviews people are probably saying that season 3 ruined the show... I honestly disagree.
Season 1 is the best in my opinion, by far.
The Demogorgon is the most fun ""monster"" there is in the show.
The way the lights flicker when he approaches out of the wall, it is actually super exciting.
The kids are only getting introduced and every character has it's own very clear personality, Eleven is so cool that season and I just love it.
Honestly, I think that is how it should've ended.
*SPOILERS*
I think that if after the Demogorgon died the series would end, that would've been a cool ending, but it isn't...Season 2 was, honestly, not that good in my opinion.
The Demo-dogs were so plain and bland.
I liked it when there was a big thing you were scared of, not some small uninteresting ""Demo-dogs"". Sure, there's the Mind Flyer, but we never get to see too much related to this guy in that season.
We do get to see some cool new characters but it's not fun when they do nothing interesting.
There was nothing new and the ending was, just like season 1, unnecessary cliffhanger.Season 3, I loved.
It has big changes from the previous seasons, which was needed.
The kids grew up, personality changes, etc'.
The creature this season wasn't Demogorgon iconic level but it was way better than the 2nd season's.
The characters really shine here, Steve and Billy especially.
BUT HEY GUESS WHAT? Again, same ending.
Wow, who expected this? another cliffhanger.Well, still, it's a solid show, definitely one of the best Netflix's Originals.
Someone said it's better than Breaking Bad... It's no-where close, but it is super great and well done.
The acting is amazing, Millie, Joe Keery and Dacre Montgomery are superb.
I'm looking forward to season 4."
1964,"The worst part of this season is Priah Ferguson's scenes. She is so mouthy it is a total turn off. I listen to mouthy obnoxious kids in real life, the last thing I want is to hear them on screen too. Her scenes, and other tangents make the season a tough slog to get through, but overall it's worth it."
1965,"Season 3 may have eclipsed season 1. The finale was an absolute blubber fest. Everything came together and just as season 1 was the search for Will Byers, season 4 will the the search for....(won't spoil it for anyone)"
1966,"Not much of review other than the fact that the show is so good. It's funny, it's nostalgic the actors and actresses are amazing. I just absolutely love it."
1967,"Not as good as the first two seasons. Some episodes dragged. Some of the episodes were just just loud noise with a lot of strobe lighting.
Apart from that a good season. Well made, great special effects. Only really got going towards the end to look forward to season 4 which is typical with these types of shows. Looking forward to it though non the less."
1968,"It Is a good series
We are waiting the other series like that
Thanks"
1969,It's everything you want in a series. Stranger Things is so good that it is considered one of the best shows on Netflix. You will fall in love with the talented cast. The acting in this series is absolutely astonishing! No one regrets watching Stranger Things and it will soon become your favourite show. You don't know good TV shows until you have seen this. It's good for the whole family too because it is set in the 1980s so there are references adults will get but it's also funny and entertaining for the teens too. It has some bad language and a bit scary so I wouldn't say very young kids watch it but if a 12 year old can handle that then I say go ahead. Overall it's a must watch and if you haven't seen it you are definitely missing out!!!
1970,"I dont anticipate notflix to have a wonderful tv show
This is the best"
1971,Season one is good......season 2 is even better (except ep 7)........if you are in for first couple of episodes then I can guarantee that you are not going to stop until whole series is over.......perfect binge worthy show.....
1972,"This is the best tv series that i've watched, and the casts is really cute"
1973,"This is one of my favorite Tv series of all time,because the show makes you feel like you are in the 80s by showing you all the details from that era."
1974,"Very good show, great acting and awesome writing. Recommend for anybody!"
1975,The first episodes were good but then it bacame boring especially in the last episodes
1976,"Great Story. Acting is incredible. Winona Ryder by far the best acting of the show. AMAZING!! The kids are even very good. Bravo to them! Very talented! With season 2, was not overly thrilled with the hopper/eleven situation. Hiding a kid (kidnapping) is keeping her safe? That idea was horrible, also the eight? Stupid episode. But overall a great show"
1977,Im sorry while I can see the throwback to E.T. and some other 80's movies I wasnt that impressed with the series it actually got more boring as it went along and still dont quiet understand how this kid survived all that time in the other place. While it was an interesting binge I would not buy it on DVD or watch it again
1978,"If you haven't watched Stranger Things yet, what are you even doing??? It's just simply the best!"
1979,"(Review updated after Season 3).Hawkins, Indiana, 1983. A young boy, Will Byers, goes missing near a top secret government laboratory. On the same night, a strange young girl appears at a diner in the town. She has telekinetic powers and is on the run from the laboratory. The laboratory is researching supernatural phenomena and may have unwittingly unlocked a gateway to another dimension.Superb series. I am generally not into science fiction, fantasy, supernatural or horror movies or TV series but this is different. Had me hooked from the start and never let go. Incredibly intriguing - the mystery surrounding Will, the girl's background and powers, how all these hang together and what forces are at work. Very well thought-out plot, superbly executed.Very engaging too - many likeable characters, all given decent depth. The relationships between all the main characters and how these evolve make the series. If it wasn't for these it would be just another horror series.Many of the concepts aren't overly new - I was reminded of The Cabin In The Woods, Stand By Me and Cloverfield - but the way everything is brought together is.Good performances. David Harbour is excellent as Sherriff Hopper and the kids do incredibly well - good casting. Winona Ryder, the only big name in the cast (until Sean Astin and Paul Reiser appear in Season 2) is a bit irritating as Joyce Byers, though that might be the fault of her character (and thus the writers and directors). The hysteria is laid on a bit thick...After an excellent Season 1, Seasons 2 and 3 are just as good. There's always a worry with any TV series that the writers run out of ideas but don't stop production, as the money is too good. So far it is still going strong, and the writers appear keen for it to end on a high.Great TV."
1980,"I do not understand all the whiny, negative reviews. If you are a true horror fan, then watch this show all the way through. You won't be disappointed. Don't give your opinion until you have actually seen the first and second season, not just one episode or half a season. The story unfolds nicely. It may have moved slow in the first season, but I like how they beefed up the second season with more story, horror, and gore. It started out slow, but it picked up more speed in the second season. I think the acting was great. With Winona Ryder returning to acting, she even added some good texture even though she looked and acted like she was out of her mind. Who wouldn't act like that if they lost their kid? All of these kids were wonderful, but Milli Brown (who plays 11) is an awesome actress for how young she is and really stood out in her role. Someone commented that the CGI was shoddy, but I thought the CGI was great, especially when they switched to the upside down view. The demogorgon was a neat looking monster and I thought it was pretty original. The whole tone of the show was dark which is why I enjoyed it. And I really like how it had the 80's feel to it. Horror movies are cheesy, and this was a show that seemed to come out of the 80's cheesy TV and movie times and even had a nostalgic effect to it. It turned out great. If you like good cheesy fun with thrills, suspense, and/or gore in the horror genre, then watch this show. If you go into a horror show expecting things to be full of nice, kind, and sparkly G rated goodness, then go watch a Disney princess movie since you are a little princess. You are the problem why the horror genre can't gain momentum."
1981,"Dissapointing. The main charactors are very nerdish/uncoo/unfunny. Its very hard to watch them, as they are all immature zeta nerds. In other words, they suck, and are stupid."
1982,"Number 1 is I adore young child actors play main characters gangs - Mike, Will, Lucas, and Dustin. Season 2 make me angry and unfair main character treat new mad max. Great history film of 80 sci fi nostalgic. The style of 80s look greater in chronological time where Game of throne style in Medieval and Anglo Saxon. To fair, show is similar to Game Of Throne because generation of modern Anglo Saxon fantasy drama with super power. According to this show, it inspired the uncanny X-men marvel. Honestly, I frustrated in Season 2; I still love main characters. Here are some fans anger in Season main turn to cold. 
 Many people watch Mad max is newcomer that misfits reluctant party member to adopted. We need to find out Billy stepbrother date Mike's mom. Max may backlash. anyone who treat her like garbage. Great Sci- Fi. We need more characters like Lucas's sister, Will, Kali, Eleven and Billy- stepbrother. Oh, we forgot mention about a kid who African American cowboy related to Lucas. More Asian and Hispanic including new kids. Max kick out to get revenge on her friends who can't be trusted so she will blame Mike. More Erica and Will developed the childhood crush. Steve will make a new girlfriend, Kali. Hopefully in the future on season 5-6, Max had completed rivalry Mike dislike her or not interested with her. We want Max to be tough and emotional, but no more bugger. Though, Season 1 was the best one, we need more background of Mad Max's biological dad who resemble more Kevin Costner or Will Drummond or Alex Keaton. We also want to learn more Eleven's families and siblings as well. The stories need more involved childhood with Eleven and Mad max when they were kids. El hardly remember Max. Should Max get revenge and jealousy to blame friendship on Mike that Mike still can't accept her group? Max need to be more smarter like ratted Mike make him accepting her better. She can stealing Eleven's bond or join Erica more like mean girls against the boys so they will pay back. Remember the science teacher who had a Asian wife; she may had kids. I want Max to turn a psychopath, not a whiny kid. It's so cool that she riding on her skateboard, but she need to defend herself against leader Mike. I felt bad for Max because the writer has nothing do with her. We want to see more of Max's biological dad probably adopted of Eleven's siblings. Also the writer show Max's stepfather associated with Byer's father. Writers should change Max more strong character to unforgiving Mike because he unfairly treat her like a garbage. Here writer's suggestion is to show that she work arcade with one of manager together to have more video- games business. There will be new kids around arcade game store and Hawken School. The story involved Mike join arcade noticing Max in there. The story change Max's personality in tough and smarter. The scene show her force to kick order security or crew to kick him out because Mike was hard on and unfair to Max. Maybe Mike may realized he learn what happened to reject the friendship. The plot scene in Season 4 show Mike find out Billy and Karen Wheeler date. His folk Ted and Karen have some divorce issue. Max use new friends and Eleven and Kali to gang up Mike to show that Mike still do not accept Max. Clearly, Mike beg Max to help him dealing her step brother's love affair with his mom. Max may help him but can't be forgiving and trusted him because Max's rejection from the group. Max's stepfather trained her to take advantage of Wheeler not letting her to join the group. Stepfather force her to be better person. The story people need to know a lot of Max's mom connection to Ted that resemble to Lois and Peter. So far music at Snowball showing sentimental. The plot do not need Max to be more bland innocent characters. She need more tough and competitive. Characters play free ranges had definitely developed well; I love Eleven; Joyce, Jonathan, Mike and Lucas with Max. OK Barb is one disaster who is able to survived. In my view, Billy symbolize to Carl Gallagher( a little bit ( from Shameless show. I love Dacre Montgomery who surprising cast the Power ranger. Don't Forget the cameo; Lucas's sister.
Overall, great character development had changed. 10/10."
1983,"Stranger Things (Season 1)Most of us have seen or heard the hoopla around this series. Some may have even wondered at the bill boards on highway and wondered when that movie is going to release and may have embarrassed ourselves when the truth got revealed. And then there are the other section who have subscribed to Netflix specifically to watch the Season 2 as and when it gets released and even participate actively in the speculation for Season 3.To the illiterate, Stranger Things is a Netflix original series created by Duffer brothers (hindi speaking audience, i can sense the chuckle); Season 1 of which with 8 episodes was released in July 2016 and Season 2 just got out in Oct 2017. Just like the audience i mentioned above, my opinion on the series is polarized.Based in 1980's on the fictional American town of Hawkins, this retro supernatural themed series aims to target the mid 30's to 50's crowd who grew up on sci-fi , thriller and horror blockbusters delivered by Hollywood. If i have to pick and choose some of the movies it seems to have drawn inspiration from, it'd include Jumanji, E.T, Alien, A nightmare on the Elm street and even to the 2011 release Super 8. Familiar protagonists include geeky school kids, confused teenagers and tragedy hit adults prone to bad habits. Much to the dismay, at least Season 1 looked abit under funded with quality of some visual effects reflecting 1990's. The thrills mostly accompanied by loud recurring sound bits also seem familiar. But then, what made it such a big hit, why did Netflix boost the Season 2's production and marketing budget so much? Answer i think lies in the execution. To draw an analogy from cooking, it isn't the ingredients themselves but the quantity you use and the treatment you give to each ingredient which creates that perfect dish. Duffer brothers have done just that. Letting the audience feel the familiarity of the setting, get closer to the characters, making them predict what's in store in the next scene; but at the very end coming up with a twist which hooks the audience for the next episode. The approach of following 3 sets of characters - kids, teens and adults helps provides perspective where you end up appreciating the kid's inventiveness, sigh at the failings of teens and groan when you realize you are going to do the exact same things as the adults did.Performance wise Millie Baby Brown as 'Eleven' is excellent. David Harbour as police chief 'Jim Hopper' looks and acts the part of the veteran hero. My favourite, for the best look, perfect voice tone and impeccable body language is Matthew Modine as 'Dr. Martin Brenner', a perfect negative role.Instead of binge watching, I'd recommend this to be watched as 1 episode every day, preferably at night, so that when you go to bed, your brains are filled with predictions for what to expect next and at times, even dream up a few. And oh, i've a few predictions for Season 2 as well. Of course, i won't let you know until i complete the 9 episodes."
1984,"Stranger Things is probably one of the most talked about shows at the moment. When it came out,it was so huge,so many people were talking about it so I obviously had to watch it,Matt and Ross Duffer did a magnificent job making this 80's throwback,it actually felt like it was from the 80's were you could just escape from all of the money making modern bulls*it! The show even created one of my favourite characters ever,Eleven,or also known as,Jane Ives. When Season 2 came out,it was even more massive,everyone was talking about it so obviously,I watched it straight away! What did I get..nothing'..NO! Season 2 of Stranger Things is awesome,it's so awesome,I loved it,I loved it all,but it dose not get away with being the best sequel to a TV show ever,well,it did,but it had flaws,mainly,like everyone,The Lost Sister,this episode was really bad,its not that it was even bad,it was just weak and really boring,it had nothing to do with the original cast or even The Shadow Monster,Millie Bobby Brown was probably the only good thing about the episode,if I were you,skip it,you'll miss nothing except how Eleven got the crazy make over..but apart from that,Stranger Things Season 2 was a blast! And I'm so excited for S3!"
1985,"It's an multi-genre/layer series. Mind blowing creativity with many goosebumps scenes.It's worth watching. Engaging music.Letting me to the new world.The Duffer brothers nailed it.Especially Millie Bobby Brown who is perfect match for Eleven character.Actors and actresses did their work perfectly. Stunning visuals which pulls you into the new environment.After watching this series you""ll be in a hangover.Horror, this is where I'm impressed very much.Fantastic series."
1986,"It's still pretty damn good. For the story, it's more of the same honestly. What really makes season 2 is everything else. The acting, the look, the hair, the color of the surroundings (cars, etc.), the music and the graphics. This is what made it great. Acting was top notch stuff even the newcomers. Music was freaking perfect, lots of old school references especially with movies. The CGI stuff? Holy moly! I've watched Flash (which I think should get a big budget), Arrow, some other sci-fi stuff and let me tell you, this show's graphics is flawless. With other series you can tell it's a TV show. With this, you can't. I'm seriously so impressed with the graphics, it's like big budget movie graphics and I get turned off by some of the stuff in Flash. As far as TV shows go, this is a must watch. It's on another level. The number of episodes are perfect not the overdrawn 24 episodes full of fillers with like 15 minutes of substance. Let me put it this way, I couldn't have imagine this show being any better except for that 1 episode, you'll see what I mean."
1987,"Another post mentioned the huge cast of characters, and they are right. New people are introduced into this season, specifically Sadie Sink as Max, Paul Reiser as Dr. Owens, Sean Astin as Bob, and Eleven's ""sister"" Linnea Bertelsen as Roman. Each became fairly critical to the plot and took away from the original team. This is what made the flow seem a bit clunky and pushed at times, and I would have been happier if they added a few more episodes to smooth the season out better. It felt like full episodes were ""edited out"" to stick to 9 episodes. At least an episode showing how Winona's (Joyce) relationship formed with Bob. And more with Linnea and Eleven's past.I did like that Eleven ""grew"" and evolved by leaving isolation, at such a volatile and confusing age. But they did it so quickly and abruptly. It was uncomfortable, and it ended fast.Winona's character, Joyce, is as great as ever. She loves her son, and will not be persuaded against doing what she thinks is right, even if it sounds crazy like in the first season. She's smart, even though often times emotional (it is a horror, what's happened to her son, after all). Nice balance.Love the new Max character. Her brother, a creepy character introduced, lends to more darkness to the series. Will (Noah Schnapp) and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) both have big acting shoes to fill. They both do really well, Eleven especially. One of the weakest characters, in my opinion, is Nancy (Natalia Dyer). I found it worse in Season 2. She also looks sickly, physically, so it is off-putting. Emaciated. Ugh.The sci-fi part of the story is great. Nothing much to add to other posts. A fun ride, although I wish the creatures were a bit more creative. We've seen those forms before, but then, it's a TV show and those forms are already canned animations (four legged dog like and opening flower head). The development of darkness and evil possessing Will was scary (and sad for Will). It worked. Loved the ""spy"" aspect.A few things (cliff hangers) left dangling out there for the next season. ""Papa"" still alive. Underworld still exists. And the troubled sister. Potential others with powers. How refreshing to see stable families being portrayed. Parents who care (mostly), and a focus on doing what's right, and a focus on school and learning. None of the divisiveness of so much we see now.I can't wait for the next season."
1988,"Simply. Best. Show. Ever. We just devoured whole season without breaks last evening, watching till the 1.30 AM. Masterpiece, breath-taking, scary and surprising. I, with my daughter, was the one of the few lucky people of our planet who attended special event day before the premiere. We have event with bikes, some movie settings in our city (Warsaw) and finally, Castle Byers-like location, wtih sofa, armchairs, old furniture and fixtures - and the chapter one on the screen! It was awesome!P.S. Where can I get my own demo-dog? ;-)"
1989,"Well, this is really something you must watch! Everything about Stranger Things is absolutely amazing. I simply love the 80's! I was so hooked on it that I haven't slept all night even though I knew I need to go to work next morning. Winona Ryder astound me with her acting. And the kids...oh, boy...they are fantastic. Millie especially. She could be a big star in the future. The only thing that bothers me is...I can't wait for season 2 to come up!"
1990,"Seldom does a television series appear and get this much attention and excitement and praise, and even more seldom does the show actually live up to it all. Stranger Things is delightful science fiction adventure and thrills, with a surprising emotional core. It has so much going for it-- a superb cast, cinematic storytelling, humor, a touch of romance, and goosebumps. Plus a cool synth score that seems like it came right out of a 1983 John Carpenter flick.I came to this series late but am so happy I tried it. It grabbed me by the collar within minutes. Anyone who likes Supernatural, The Goonies, The X-Files, E.T., Kolchak, Stephen King stories ... well, this is a massive treat for you. I could ramble on and on about the actors, the pacing, the 80's period vibe/details, but I will just say, if you're considering Stranger Things, try it. Jump in. It's worthwhile."
1991,"Overall, I liked Stranger Things more than I didn't, but I think that the show is overrated.Pros:Like the summary says, the storyline is creative and enjoyable for the most part. The main reason for why I stuck around till the end is because I wanted to know what will happen after each episode. The setting is nice, with the eighties recreated really well. The soundtrack is great, and it works really effectively with the setting. MOST of the characters were well written and acted (note that I said ""most."") Jim Hopper and Will's mother stood out as being especially good.Cons:The show is full of wince inducing clichés. From painfully unrealistic bully clichés, to predictable and overdone dialogue, Stranger Things has it all. It's also extremely cheesy at times. I found myself flipping the screen off on multiple occasions because it got too idiotic for me to handle. It's an unpopular opinion, but I particularly disliked Eleven's character. Though the actress did a decent job at acting what she was given, I felt like her dialogue and gimmick was the most corny out of everyone's. It seemed like her supernatural powers were pulled off in the most cringe worthy manner possible (although nobody seems to agree with me on it.) There are many cheap jump-scares. Although some had good build ups, each one was the same - a sudden roar accompanied by a loud sound effect.To conclude, Stranger Things is okay. With some shows and movies, I can look past the negatives if the rest is good enough, but I struggled to do that on this occasion. I'll probably be watching season 2 to see what it has to offer."
1992,"/refers to Season 1/In general, I am not into supernatural force dramas, particularly when the ""monsters"" are unaware of their wickedness, but after reading praising views and emanating from limited number (8) of episodes, I decided to give it a try... And became gradually contented.Well, the beginning was slow and the child characters reminded me the ones in e.g. Stand By Me, but the distinctive performance of Winona Ryder and the hints that ""earthly"" forces are also ""guilty"" made me to appreciate several nuances and scenes. Although being definitely the most famous performer, Mrs. Ryder did not steal the show, but was at best excelling herself as a fine team player. Most of the youth were bright-line as well and evidently not picked from model agencies based on ""cute"" looks. Besides, the series includes a good cinematography and creation of suitable atmosphere, with the events dating back to the 1980ies, to the days I was young myself, with all that music and outfit...Despite the pacing was uneven at times, and some scenes were protracted or did not provide additional value to the series, I would like to watch Season 2 when revealed. Some final scenes from Episode 8 excited my interest and let me ponder on and over how the next season could evolve - as many questions found their answer and events did find their closure.PS In fact, I liked Season 2 a bit more - due to enchanced sci-fi action."
1993,"Stranger Things (2016): Stranger things is the most hyped and critically acclaimed series of 2016.I just couldn't stop myself writing this review after watching its finale.So how is it?Plot:On November 6, 1983 in the town of Hawkins,Indiana, 12-year-old Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) vanishes mysteriously. Will's frantic mother, Joyce (Winona Ryder), searches for him while Police Chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) launches his own investigation. Will's friends Mike (Finn Wolfhard),Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) and Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin) discover a psychokinetic girl named Eleven (Millie Brown) who claims to know Will's location.Mike's sister Nancy (Cara Buono) who has in relationship with Steve (Joe Keery) teams up with Jonathan Bryers (Charlie Heaton),brother of Will Bryers to investigate the mystery of the disappearance of her friend Barbara (Shannon Purser). As all of them uncover the truth, a sinister government agency tries to cover it up, while a more insidious force lurks below the surface.Plus Points:1)Performances: Casting is the major highlight of Stranger Things.Each and every actor in this series played their roles with perfection.We cannot highlight any one because everyone gave award winning performance.Winona Ryder as grieving mother,Millie Brown as psycho kinetic girl,the kids,Charlie Heaton,Cara Buono, everyone are brilliant.This show is a proof of true hidden talents.2)Engaging screenplay: Stranger Things is highly engaging in every episode.There is exactly no dull moments in all of the eight episodes.Every episode has its own mark and ends with suspense note.The way they showed all the stories in parallel way is brilliant as all of them got equal priority.It is emotional,scary,thrilling,cute and some times funny too.3)Direction: Stranger Things can be considered as an exceptional hard work of The Duffer brothers.These guys are brilliant and got success in bringing a masterpiece in retro style.Though they got inspired from 80's style works of Spielberg's The Goonies where bunch of kids try to solve a mystery.Its their vision which made this show a masterpiece.4)Setting: The way they showed the setting of 1980's is awesome,They are so real that we can easily get dragged into the show.5)Music: Music in Stranger Things is terrific and played a crucial role in its pacing,Especially its theme is haunting and never leaves our mind.Minus Points: There are none but I feel that VFX is bit poor.So,Stranger Things is one of the best TV series of all time.It is brilliant engaging drama thriller where every minute keeps you at the edge of the seat for entire 8 episodes.Waiting for season 2.My rating 10/10"
1994,What can I say? Felt like I was back in 1982!!!!! Amazing!!! Superb!!!! Great acting!!!!! Excellent effects!!! Great story!!!!! Great writing!!!! Can't wait for season 2!!!!!!!! Bring it on!!!!!! Need more shows like this!!! At last no more Hollywood remakes!!!! Less drama more intrigue!!!! Please don't waste season 2:) Keep what works!!!!!Seriously this deserved the applause it's getting!Well done Netflix!!!!You really scored high!!!Keep up the same tempo!!!Don't ruin it please!!!!!
1995,"Absolutely amazed and astounded with the quality, emotion, thrill and story behind this top notch show. Set with an awesome blend of 80s X-Files/Modern Sci-Fi Thriller, this makes it to my all time favorites. Gripping and inspiring from start to finish, there is no chance this show can waste your time. Well paced, with a great cast and attachment to characters, my appreciation only got better as I watched.This is one of those shows that deserves your time. I can only think of someone being dissatisfied with this if they genuinely disliked the genre and were very picky. Cannot stress how much I recommend this, and to me and many others, it deserves all 10 of its stars.Whether you're into a bit of drama, a horror/thriller, some Sci-Fi, government conspiracy, psychic powers, a classic crime story or young love, Stranger Things packs it all into a fantastic experience you won't forget any time soon."
1996,"Its The Best Fiction Show.The Story Building Is Very Slow But Very Interesting. Acting Of All Crew Is Very Good. The Way Story Goes, Pretty Classic But Very Interesting. If U Like Si-Fi And Other Fiction Show Than U Will Definitely Like It Condition To Have Some Patience As Story Is Very Slow Moving And Classic. But Direction And Story Line Is Very Strong. In Starting It Feels Like Very Slow Moving And For A Time Being It Became Boring, But As Story Goes Further There Is Element Of Surprise And Secrete That Make This Show Very Interesting. A Group Of Smart And Talented Kids And Their Unity Makes It Very Good. In Short If U Are Fiction Lover And Little Bit Patient U Should Definitely Watch It."
1997,"Story >> The story is good but not unique, you can pretty much see it in some of the horror films. That's right, the show didn't appear as a series to me but as a good horror/mystery movie rather. There's no twists and turns. It didn't give quite the scare or mysterious vibe.Characters >> The characters are generic. The actors/actresses' portrayal is fine but sometimes, becomes annoying. There's nothing depth about the characters, even the supposed to be mysterious ones aren't intriguing but perhaps, they'll grow in season 2. Usually, there are characters that you'll like the moment you see them, but that isn't the case in here. I can't root for them, I just see them as plain characters of a show. I don't feel any connection towards any of them that I won't really care if someone dies.Graphics >> It's pretty good. I do appreciate most of the movie/show graphics, actually. Since I'm always left in wonder of how they can pull it off.Sound >> It's lacking in this point. This is one of the reasons why it didn't give quite a scare or mysterious vibe. The choice of music isn't impressive either.Overall >> It's good and worth a watch, but I don't think it deserved a 9+ rating. In the end, it isn't bad, but it isn't that good either."
1998,"Couldn't get into the feel of S1 or S2. Not that I didnt appreciate the accuracy of the Timeline, especially since I was that same age in the 80's. But S3 changed all of that. S3 was one of the greatest shows ever to hit the ""Idiot Box""...
Every episode was great and a finale that'll blow your mind. Especially if your a fan of SciFi Horror. Not only are the Fx spectacular, the lighting and camera work is worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. The suspense, even when you know this monstrosity is right in front of you, the Writers and various Directors hit it out of the Park. Easy 10/10."
1999,"I'm not sure there's ever been a second of boredom watching this show, it's not slow and will keep you interested the whole time and each season has a great story. It's definitely worth your time and in my opinion may be Netflix's best show out right now. Can't wait for season 4!."
2000,"Hotter than Phoebe Cates .....
Arnold Schwarzenegger (imitated) .....
Fat Rambo .....
The Karate Kid shirt .....Love it !!!"
2001,"All 3 seasons of Stranger Things had me addicted from the beginning. This show is truly everything that draws you into a show and keeps your attention. Plus, after watching who doesn't want to play a little D&D? Always eager for more!"
2002,This show really catches the viewers mind to think more about itself due to its amazing storylines and well made action sequences one of the best made by netflix.
2003,"As someone who was born in 1980, Stranger Things literally takes me back to my youth, and absolutely nails it!!! Even the product placement of Burger King reminds me of when my local Wimpy closed and Burger King took over in the 1980s. And the sound track is incredible with great references to other movies from the 80s like Jackie Wilson's ""Higher and Higher"" which was the song from Ghostbusters 2 when they filled the statue of liberty with slime, and the ""Never Ending Story"" by Limahl from the movie of the same name. If you liked the previous two series, you'll love this one :)"
2004,Loved every bit of it. It is becoming too good season by season . Superb acting by all d cast and superb storyline. No one will be disappointed after dis season. Hope season 4 comes out soon enough .
2005,"Here we go: This series is an allegory about the effect global warming is having not only on the planet, but on other dimensions within it. Lookout!, the series says, or you'll disturb the shadow monsters, that hate heat, and they'll getcha. The kids have a ""party"", odd isn't it? Unless you consider ""club"" is too exclusive a word. They are aligned in their ""heroic"" roles, and have ""true sight"". They're a perfect blend of Black, Jewish, soft White Boys, and one tough Tomgirl from a broken, angry white family. ""Friends Don't Lie to Each Other"" is their mantra."
2006,"This show is amazing and me and my whole family love it, especially the fact that there is no political correctness, Please please please keep out all the gay and trans crap!!!!!!!!! It isn't needed and also more Easter eggs please, I love all of that. This is show is definitely ten out of 10 though."
2007,"Adventurous plot and the acting is done well, however, with the exception of Rider, Barbour, and one of the child actors, very little sympathy can be garnered for the other characters....the over acting and unbelievable over the top behavior breaks the sense of reality the writers hoped to accomplish....problems with the plot development. Secondary plot involving teen love is weak which dilutes the primary premise. The artistic license inventing the risks that the characters is not plausible leaving the viewer with a sense of frustration trying to reconcile the behavior leaving one to loose empathy for all the characters....very unrealistic. It a shame that the actors were saddled with a plot that nearly trumps their attempts to pul it off.Too bad...it could have been a winner."
2008,"Everything I expected it to be, anyone that said it garbage should be ashamed, obviously their tiny minds could not comprehend what they had witnessed..."
2009,"This is a quality show. The first season was amazing with the whole ""new"" concept of using oldschool vibes mixed with a great story having kids in the center. It was entertaining and I just fell in love with all the characters. I know the second season didn't get that warm welcome but I still loved it (even that weird 8th episode) and how the kids grew with their characters. And I swear waiting two years for this third season worth every second because it was a real masterpiece. 8 episodes full of action, not a single filler scene, they let the kids turn into teens the right way, did not forget about minor characters...even the new ones like Robin were pretty loveable. I just finished it and I'm in shock. They changed character arcs and let some space to drama I cried my eyes out at the end (and surpsizingly I did it for the guy I liked the least...)
SPOILER:
The only thing I don't like that much is that they teared Mike and El apart again... also Nancy and Jonathan (why? aren't they supposed to start university?) I mean I understand that they needed to do this so they can bring the action out of Hawkings for the next season but it's still so sad."
2010,"Just love this show, nothing to ask, just taht the seasons keep coming"
2011,"Top quality acting and story throughout every season. I usually am annoyed by kid actors but this show truly shows the talent in younger generations. Absolutely brilliant screenplay, writing, visual effects, and acting!"
2012,"Excellent story to share with the family. Season 3 use of God Damn, Jesus Christ and Jesus as slang, was said so often it was silly. Kids did not talk that way in the 80s. The only complaint about Season 3."
2013,Even though it was a bit slow at the beginning this season is full of action with our favourite team! Well done! Waiting for season 4! Btw they have are grown up to become great actors!!!
2014,"3rd season is just so great.
You can feel that 80's mood and the story is so good and everything
This is so exciting"
2015,"We marathoned it yesterday, so good. First season was cool, setting up the characters and the storyline. Second season came on strong, wasn't sure where they'd go but it churned out some new characters and non-stop action. We were interested in the third since they had closed it out nicely but the writers did a good job of pulling us back in. The one weakness is that for some odd reason they had a quarter of the kids come out of the closet!? We just looked at each other in confusion. I guess they got a gay writer who wanted to make a statement. Shame that they took the 3% from the CDC and bumped it up 10 times -- out of place and unappreciated. The music was outstanding -- I will be looking for the soundtrack. The 1980s did have the best music. There is a lot to work with here and we'll see if they come back for a season four. I hope so!"
2016,"In my opinion, between season 1 and 2 it's lit for Season 3. Just you know there was made me blow my mind, such a after watching this yah i'm feel cry about this time of all scene need me patient all the time again, NEEDLY SEASON 4!! THIS IS BIG NOT ENOUGH AGAIN.. LOVE YOU ALL GUYS!!!"
2017,Just gotta say that i love jim hoppers crazy eyes. he is so hilarious with his facial expressions
2018,"It's an average show that never quite got to grab my attention with neither characters, nor plot, nor world building"
2019,"Season 1, easily a 9.5/10, season 2 still good, probably a 9.1/10. But season 3 makes the show go SO downhill...
I would personally rate season 3 a 6.7/10, it sparked awful teenage fan bases, and what the hell is ""Mileven?"" The season did have a couple good traits, but it was mostly crap. I really didn't enjoy that it showed the child character's personal lives when they are not immersed in unusual activity, the final episode was the only good one of season 3, and even that was pretty weak compared to the other seasons. I have quite low expectations for season 4, due to the sheer awfulness of the previous season."
2020,Very exciting story: what will happen to this nice bunch of kids? A bit yucky at times though with the strangest things!
2021,I really didn't get a liking to stranger things but after the second season I was hooked I love that it set in the 80s and in a small town my favorite character is eleven cause she's the type of girl all young boys in the 80s would want the rest of the kids are cool to but el is my favorite this show has not had a bad episode and I think it will not ever
2022,"Season 1 managed to keep me interested the cliffhangers we're very good and it ended up being pretty amazing, Season 2 was average but fun and season 3 now 💔 terrible what a terrible show should have ended long ago
Makes zero sense to me"
2023,This one from Netflix is Good . Stranger things is Good . The Duffer Brothers have done a Good job . But you can't compare Stranger things with Money Heist or Dark .
2024,"Season 1: I'll give season 1 a 9.5 out of 10. Everything's fantastic, but I hate when people say it's perfect because those bleeping bullies! They're so corny and badly written. You could say ""ITS A 1980s OMAGE, OF COURSE THERE ARE BULLIES!"" But i promise for all you season 3 haters (Ill get to that later) if they were in season 3, you would complain. I LOVE SEASON 1!To all season 3 haters, I do understand how you would dislike the change in tone but i loved it!"
2025,This is a great retro nostalgic series with many twists and turns!.
2026,"Back in 1971 when Peter Bogdonavich released The Last Picture Show it received mostly rave reviews. One of the few dissenting opinions was the late critic John SImon who said it was a patchwork of other directors shots-a Hitchcock shot here and a Ford scene there, etc. I am reminded of this when I first watched Stranger Things seasons 1-3. The obvious influence is Stephen King whose fingerprints would seem to be all over it, though I know he was not involved. The boys banding together, the evil government agency holding a little girl because of her ""powers"", an absentee Dad and even the nose bleeds El has when she uses her power are right out of Firestarter. There are also allusions to John Carpenter (especially his film ""The Thing"") and Steven Spielberg. In the season 2 there has also been scenes lifted right out of The Exorcist and in season 3 The Terminator.
This not to say that the show isn't entertaining. It's a lot of fun and keeps your attention going from episode to episode. The acting is uniformly good-nice to see Winona Ryder back , same with Paul Reiser. Special effects are very good too. I watched it as a guilty pleasure and just to see how many movie influences I could name."
2027,"Remarkable story writing, the vfx, and the background music everything was just fabulous."
2028,"All I want to say that if I can give it more than 10 I absolutely will , I think this series will change something in me"
2029,Loving this show! Perfect to get you into the fall/autumn mood. Gave me the chills many times! Would recommend for sure. Can't wait for the next season.
2030,"After Season 3, I could barely wait for Season 4. Do not listen to any of the reviews reporting about the third season being unneeded and any sort of teenager cliche. It is not. It is so much more than that. Eleven has developed into a girl, which eventually happens after months of being in the world. Season 3 is not a cliche, it is a reality of how the kids have matured and grown up. The way they're developing is simply beautiful. We needed some more laughs during Season 3, and that was what was provided. Yes, I agree, specks of the magic have been lost, ever since the 80s style has been fixed into the third season, but it is a fresh new start. I, myself, loved and enjoyed the style of everything. It portrays almost every character as an important one, which I appreciate greatly. Stranger Things never fails to disappoint. The Duffer Brothers have seemed to nail it again."
2031,"After the disappointment of the bloated and characterless ST2, I didn't have high hopes for ST3. The first 2 episodes then seemed to confirm my fears and then episode 3 happened and the series then exploded into life.ST3 is then at different points funny, bonkers, clever, gripping, silly, charming, compelling and as ever full of respectful homages. Everyone concerned looks like they had a great time making the series and the script gags feel like they were fine tuned by the Modern Family writers.The ending does seem a little out of kilter with the overall good natured atmosphere TDB developed (imagine The Goonies vs The Terminator) but then we get a teaser ending to keep us on the hook for ST4.Congratulations to TDB and the actors for bringing back the spirit and the sheer fun of ST1 back to the series."
2032,This series made me feel like it was my childhood.
2033,"1 perfect
2 meh
3 great.
Pumped to see how they'll continue season 4."
2034,The best tv series that I had never watched before. I spent 2 days watching 2 seasons of this film
2035,Season 1 unique and wonderful and suspenseful at the same time. Season 2 even more intriguing and keeps you stick to the tv
2036,"OKAY but Stranger Things is probably one of the best shows -there's no point denying that. It's great! I saw the first two season back in November 2017 and it has been my favorite show ever since!First of all- the storyline. It's so captivating and interesting you'll get addicted to the show. You just... can't stop watching. It may be predictable sometimes but y'know... it's still good. Great job to the Duffers!The characters- every character is so interesting in their own way. Some of the characters like Steve Harrington have evolved in their own good way, even when others like Mike, Dustin, Lucas and El stayed the same. I can't wait to see more of Max's character! Even though you may hate some characters *cough cough BILLY* you can't deny they're all pretty interesting. My personal favorites are Steve, Eleven, Max and Hopper.The acting- THE ACTING IS GREAT! Not only the adults but the kids' acting is fantastic!! I was impressed by Millie Bobby Brown's (Eleven) acting, and don't get me started about Noah Schnapp's (Will Byers) in season 2. They're all great! I think though Winona Ryder and Noah deserve more recognition for their (great) work.In conclusion, Stranger Things is a great show. A must watch if you love 80s movies and music! All the noms and awards are really well deserved. 100% recommend!!"
2037,Best serie I've ever seen xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxcxcccccccc
2038,"This show is amazing it's not to scary and not to cheesy it's the perfect re-creation of the 1980's the show is pretty much consistent there is only one episode in season 2 that sucks. The characters are fun and overall the shows supernatural take on the 80's is perfect! The kids in the show reference things that were big in the 80's like Star Wars, dungeons and dragons is also a big part of the show. I personally didn't grow up in the 80's but because of this show I have fallen in love with anything 80's. The show is intense, highly entertaining, and very unpredictable which makes it fun to watch. One of Netfix's Best!"
2039,"Stranger Things is fresh and original, creating a story and world the likes of which we've never seen before.. at least that's what everyone who hasn't seen Twin Peaks says.It's not that Stranger Things isn't good, because it is. The issue is that it's something that's been done before. The small town where everyone knows everyone; the kid that goes missing and is found dead under strange circumstances; the mirror world where darker things lurk; the distraught parent that nearly goes insane; the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer.. uh, sorry, Will Byers.I could list for a long time the plot points stolen from Twin Peaks, but I shan't (Most of them are glaringly obvious anyway). Instead, I will mention the merits of the show;The young actors are very talented. This is something no one can take away from them; they are excellent at portraying confused yet brave kids in the 80s and have a great skill set that rivals many of the adults on the show. The building of suspense is good; they know not to show the monster straight out and when they do give glimpses; it still maintains the fear factor. The story is good. It is not amazing, but it is enough to make you want to get to the end. Were the ending of Season 1 not exactly the same as Twin Peak's finale (Going to the other side and then a main character being possessed by the evil forces whilst seeming normal to his friends), then maybe I would have hungered more for Season 2, but as it stands I could move on from the show now without any regret.A good show overall, but needs to break out into its own before I can call it great."
2040,"I think it's safe and surprising to say that the Netflix original series Stranger Things is a popular hit that is irresistible to viewers. This adventurous, funny, and chilling series has become a very appealing and binge worthy show. This series is a mix of sci-fi, horror, with humor and adventure. It is about a boy named Will who disappears into thin air, while his three best friends Mike, Dustin, and Lucas and mother Joyce devote their time to looking for him. In the midst of searching for Will we discover an odd girl, who we soon know as Eleven who has mysterious mental powers. Along with the discovery of Eleven a secretive facility where government experiments are held is brought to the viewers attention. The biggest part may be this unknown, obscure, and dark ""upside down"" dimension where supernatural forces exist. To me this show is a perfect blend of mystery, horror, humor, and adventure. The fact that it is based in the 80s also makes the show more appealing in my opinion. A big part of this show consists of the viewer getting entrenched in the imaginations of the three boys Mike, Lucas, and Dustin. Their search for Will turns into a quest filled with adventure, curiosity, and danger. These boys are essentially the heart of the show and as a viewer you grow to care for them. You feel as if you are on this crazy ride with them and it makes the show that much better. Because this show is such a great blend of sci-fi and humor that still makes you become emotionally attached to the characters. The performances of these children in this show is some of the best acting I have seen from younger kids. Each actor plays their part perfectly creating an extremely real life friend group that you would expect to see in real life. At one point in the show, the boys arrange a plan to go to search for Will. During this we see clearly the different roles and personalities in this friend group. Mike being the leader, Lucas being the serious and logical friend, and Dustin being the funny, slightly scared, but entertaining friend. We see these roles when they share what they came with to be prepared for the search for Will. Dustin had brought in his bag mostly snacks and junk food, while Lucas and Mike brought there slingshot for rocks, a compass, and a map (a little more ideal for searching in the woods at night). Their acting and ability to become their character makes it very easy for the viewer to become hooked. Stranger Things is also based in the 80s. This show would really not be the same if it did not have this setting and time frame. The walkie-talkies, the Dungeons and Dragons, the clothes and hair, and the bikes all resemble the 80s and really entrench the viewer with this 80s feel in a eerie and complex plot. The boys are constantly using their giant walkie-talkies to communicate with each other. Without this 80s aesthetic this freaky show would not have the upbeat and fun loving qualities that it does. Another important part of this 80s throwback is the music played in the show. Like I said before, these songs are what make the show so upbeat and lively while still having nostalgic moments. When Joyce was searching for Will in the lights of her house, she followed the flickering lights up to Will's door which was shut. As she was standing there the song ""Should I stay or should I go"" by The Clash started blaring from the boom box in Will's room. In the midst of Joyce losing it and trying to communicate with Will the upbeat song gives us hope that Will is still alive and will make it back to his family and friends. I found that the 80s related music adds to the overall 80s theme and makes the scenes more dramatic. With Stranger Things having a very strong 80s aesthetic with a very kid focused and fantasy based overall plot it correlates tremendously with the movie E.T.. Like Stranger Things E.T. is also an 80s movie and is heavily focused around kids and the adventures they endure. Both of these works start out with the game Dungeons & Dragons. Just as Mike, Lucas, and Dustin found Eleven in the woods, a strange alien like girl, Elliot also finds E.T. in the woods. Elliot takes E.T. home and hides him in his closet just as Mike hides Eleven in his basement. In each work Eleven and E.T. are both even dressed up in a blonde wig and traditional clothes. They also relate in the fact that the kids are always riding their bikes, usually at night when it's more scary. It is very clear that these two works have very similar aspects, mostly being centered around the kids. Both works are centered around the adventure and wonder found in the kids and the mysterious things that can come from this wonder. Overall, this show is very unique and wonderful. There is quite a bit that happens throughout the show but somehow it works very stunningly. The 80s theme, the music, the adventure and curiosity, the mystery and horror all create a very extraordinary series. The show has a great deal of emotion for being a sci-fi horror series. The nostalgia with the mix of humor and wonder is what has made this show so addictive. It definitely keeps you on your toes, but you really do fall in love with the characters and the plot as a whole."
2041,"One of the best shows from the original Netflix.. I really didn't expect that when i knew it is a Netflix original.. Watch it and u will never regret.. Season one started and ended very exciting... Season two kept the same pace., it is not every day where u see a TV show with existing events at almost every episode"
2042,"This is a really good series with a nice plot, great atmosphere and good characters. When I see this type of series some thoughts about strange things in the series comes and I have a hard time to stop thinking of them. In the first series when Barb disappeared, why did not anybody, like Nancy, suspect Jonathan for this. He had been acting very strangely and was at the scene at the time Barb disappeared. This seems to me like a logical why to think, but it is never brought up in the series.In the second season I have a bit more complaints. I like it overall and the last two episodes are really good especially. Elevens side plot feels disconnected, not that fun to watch and episode seven feels like it destroys the flow of the series. Also the ending of season one don't feel that great anymore because she escapes almost immediately and where not really in any harm. She then returns towards the end of season two almost like a deus ex machina. Sad that they give her only like two scenes with the other kids. Its like they don't know what to do with her and they don't want to have her in the picture at first because she can solve the problem. I wonder why Hopper Never think about this. I also feel that the kids don't really do much in this series except towards the end. Hopper and Wills mom are the heroes in this one.After the end of season one I feared that the second season would not be as good, because how could you continue now when you know so much about eleven and you know about the upside-down. Could you really have the same mystery horror? If you tried to expanded more about the upside- down, could that make it more good and interesting or make it worse and possibly ridicules? I think they did it good in the new season, but they did not explain or expand the upside-down really. Its just some large unknown treat which they don't go into any detail. I think that was kind of meh."
2043,"Don't listen to the toothpick audience, the extreme minority in this case, who are trashing this show as unoriginal. Who cares!!!They just took what we all enjoyed from other movies, put it together with a cast you can't help but root for and love their chemistry is so good, and they made it work. Couldn't wait for 2, and couldn't get enough of it. Wished it was a few episodes longer, loved it!!!"
2044,I really like this 80's Spielberg inspired sci-fi-saga. Finn Wolfhard should have some better direction though. He tries too hard to deliver his lines sometimes. When he doesn't he is excellent though. The rest of the cast is also very good. Especially Millie Bobby Brown. And Noah Schnapp in the second season.
2045,"This show was completely awesome and I loved seeing it. Seeing the shows and the supernatural monsters. I really enjoyed seeing the fiction fuse with actual reality situations. This show had a very curious return for Will when his mom and friends saved him. I thought it was crazy to see the show develop on people missing and also, finding that Will may not actually be Will. With season 2 I loved because of how it started with Eleven being stuck in the upside down reality. But when she came back it looked very similar to a giving birth. It was cool as season 2 developed to see Will slowly get possessed by his past demons that have some how evolved into stronger type of symbioses. It was interesting to see that now these creatures could pull you into their reality whenever they wanted. It was also interesting to find out Eleven or Jane had a mother and she was able to find her. It was also interesting to see Jane show how she feels about Mike with getting jealous. Also seeing the background on Jane was pretty cool as well and even her mom's backstory was done in a timely fashion I would say. And how her mom was affected by the same man that made her who she was. It was also, funny seeing bob go through all the families stranger things and fighting through it very slowly. I thought hopper had died in this season as well. Seeing Will go through the exorcism when certain tentacles were burned was a very intense and awesome scene as well."
2046,"This is a television series that's set in Indiana and has won several awards. It's a mixture of drama, horror, mystery and science fiction.The first season is set in 1983 and was released in July 2016. The second season is set in 1984 and is due to be released in October 2017.A young boy goes missing and his friends look for him. They instead find a young girl who has telekinetic powers. The authorities claim that the boy has been found dead. However, some residents discover that his corpse is actually a dummy and that he's alive. They then try to establish contact with him.The writing and acting are good and it's significantly better than most TV series. However, it's slow in parts and I don't agree that it's outstanding."
2047,"A young, brown-haired boy rides his bike down a moonlit street. Suddenly, the headlight on his bike goes out. After glancing down at the light, he looks back up to see a monstrous figure standing in the middle of the road, causing him to veer off into a ditch. He sprints away from his crashed bike into the woods. Whatever he saw, it wasn't human. And it was pursuing him.With haste, the boy darts through the front door of his house, out the back and into a tiny shed in his backyard.Silence.Hands trembling, the boy grabs his family rifle and loads it.The shed door creaks.His breathing quickens. He aims the rifle at the door.A low growl emits from the darkness as a shadow slowly rises behind the boy. He locks eyes with the hidden creature, allowing terror to consume him.Tension builds with the score; the fizzling of the shed's lone light bulb grows louder and louder as the camera zooms in on itSilence. A wide shot of an empty shed. The light bulb lingers as the scene gradually fades to black.On July 15, 2016, my parents and I sat down to watch the pilot for a Netflix original series called ""Stranger Things."" From the opening sequence described above, we knew we were in for something special.The story revolves around the mysterious disappearance of 11-year-old Will Byers and the odd rippling effect it has on the residents and atmosphere of 1983 Hawkins, Indiana. Will's mother, Joyce – a single mom already struggling with her own issues – becomes frantic and distressed in her son's absence.At first, the town seems unconcerned. ""Will probably just ran away,"" or, ""maybe he's hiding?"" Disappearances like this were rare at the time, as local police chief Jim Hopper is quick to point out. He says, ""You want to know the worst thing that's happened here in the four years I've worked here? The worst thing? It was when an owl attacked Eleanor Gillespie because it thought her hair was a nest.""As the investigation deepens, however, another person goes missing. A secret government facility is discovered in the woods of Hawkins, and a young girl named Eleven is revealed to have the power of telekinesis.My biggest fear for this show after seeing the trailer was that it would live up to its name, that its sci-fi and fantasy elements would overpower any sort of depth and realism present. While there are plenty of bizarre moments and far-fetched concepts in ""Stranger Things,"" they exist only to compliment the characters that keep us grounded in reality.The three main characters are 11-year-old friends of Will's named Mike, Dustin and Lucas, and Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin do an excellent job at bringing them to life. They play ""Dungeons and Dragons"" in their parents' basements. They laugh. They curse. They fight. It all feels genuine, and when Will goes missing, they band together and risk their lives to find him.Winona Ryder and David Harbour shine as Joyce Byers and Chief Hopper, respectively. Ryder conveys well the desperation any mother would feel after the disappearance of her son, as well as the raw determination to find him and bring him home. The character arc of Hopper from complacent drunk to fearless leader is also incredibly satisfying to watch.Amongst all of the great performances, however, the standout is easily Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven. Her character is shrouded in mystery and secrecy. She has a dark and troubled past, and her superhuman abilities serve as a gift and a curse throughout the story.Eleven's dialogue is limited, meaning that most of her character had to be communicated through facial expressions, mannerisms and inner dialogue, and 12-year-old Brown accomplishes this masterfully.""Stranger Things"" takes us back to the world of the 1980s, a world of Realistic-branded walkie talkies, Levi's corduroy jackets and wood-paneled station wagons. It was a time when kids could ride their bikes home at night without the fear of being kidnapped; when privacy on a phone call was dependent on the length of your rotary telephone chord.Its soundtrack is infused with 80s classics. In one scene, Will and his brother, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), bond over ""Should I Stay or Should I Go"" by The Clash. In another, romance blossoms to the sounds of Toto's ""Africa.""Above all, ""Stranger Things"" is a love letter to 80s film. The tune of the opening credits is set to 80s-style synthesizers, which were commonly used in B-level horror movies at the time. Long hikes along railroad tracks evoke images of 1986's ""Stand By Me."" And as the children and Eleven fled the evil government scientists on their bikes, I'm sure that somewhere Steven Spielberg shed tears of joy on E.T.'s behalf.The Duffer Brothers have utilized the power of Netflix to create something unique. ""Stranger Things"" provides loads of 80s nostalgia for adults, while also reintroducing us millennials to the staples of that era. It is horrifying and uplifting; darkly humorous; unrealistic, yet somehow grounded in reality.With season two on the horizon and with presumably many stories left to tell, ""Stranger Things"" has only scratched the surface of its potential. Hopefully in the not-so-distant future, we will be able to look back on ""Stranger Things"" as a classic, a ""Goonies"" for our generation to pass onto the next. After all, stranger things have happened."
2048,"Watched Stranger Things Featuring Millie Bobby Brown(Intruders) as Eleven ""El"", Finn Wolfhard(Supernatural) as Mike Wheeler, Gaten Matarazzo(The Blacklist) as Dustin Henderson , Caleb McLaughlin(Blue Bloods) as Lucas Sinclair,Natalia Dyer(The Greening Of Whitney Brown) as Nancy Wheeler.Charlie Heaton(Shut In) as Jonathan Byers , Noah Schnapp(Bridge Of Spies) as Jonathan Byers,Cara Buono(The Sorpranos) as Karen Wheeler ,David Harbour(The Equalizer) as Jim Hopper,Matthew Modine(The Dark Knight Rises) as Dr.Martin Brenner, Joe Keery(Chicago Fire) as Steve Harrington, Sadie Sink() as Max,Dacre Montgomery(Safe Neighborhood) as Billy and Winona Ryder(Star Trek,Black Swan) as Joyce Byers.A Little late to the party But I really enjoyed Stranger Things A bit of Slow start and Nancy Wheeler's Romantic subplot drags the series for a bit but also really enjoyed it, its a more Creepier version of Super 8 also really enjoyed the Characters .great Score By Newcomers Kyle Dixon & Michael Stein ,Showrunner(s) Matt & Ross Duffer(Hidden),A More Creepier Version Of Super 8 9/10"
2049,"""You shut up!"" ""No! You shut up!""Above is just one of the amazing lines of dialog you will hear in stranger things - over and over and over and over again. And Winona's winy voice while she screams every line? It makes you jump to turn the volume down! The dialog in this show is often painfully annoying, only equaled by the screaming deliveries. And it is constant! The grating nature of how the characters scream at each other does not let up for the entire season.Screeching aside, Stranger Things is obviously well produced. Everything came together in terms of look, effects and sound - there is a very consistent style that works perfectly for a show with this science fiction/horror theme. It doesn't take long to discover that budget and (nuts and bolts) filmmaking are huge upsides to this show. The producers should be (and I'm sure are) really happy with their creation.And what is Stranger Things? I'd call it a hybrid science fiction/horror tale involving several families from a small American town, with special focus on the kids. The kids are the main characters, and the viewers become involved in their epic adventure. Stranger Things borrows and steals ideas form other film makers and writers, with generally a 1980's feel. There are a lot of interesting ideas ranging from weird science to mental powers to horrific monsters from bizarre alternate realities. Interestingly though - none of it feels fresh - because every idea is a lift from another source.I admit I was pretty excited for this show based upon the premise, but my anticipation was quickly squashed in the first two episodes. I love homage, borrowing - even outright stealing of ideas if they build into something better than the original. But when ideas are taken and squandered, it's just frustrating.I'm not talking about the obvious Carpenter, Spielberg or King lifts - all of which were done (imo) with class. The Carpenter'esque title design, music is excellent. The King horror ideas work pretty well! Most of the Spielberg stuff would be lifts from Poltergeist, and his skill at directing kids - which, again, is pretty slick in how the ideas are merged.But this gets to my gripe - which is very specific - This is the second time Dan Simmons' Summer of Night has been blatantly ripped off - and not in a way that does any justice to this amazingly entertaining book. The first time this book was ripped off was JJ's Super 8 (yea... starting to get more convincing, eh?) - a movie that clearly shares a lot of the same qualities as Stranger Things. Dan Simmons is a brilliant writer, and while Summer of Night is far from his greatest book, it is a very special book to him. The book has a real personal touch, the kids are so believable and captivating, and their trials... to see the blatant lifts, right down to specific character details and story events... it's frustrating!so... my ax is super sharp due to all the grinding - if you like this show, I strongly recommend reading Simmons' Summer of Night.this show? Annoying well made rip off? 6 out of 10"
2050,"I wasn't sure about this series at first, but I heard such great stuff about the series from my brother, so I decided to give the series a watch. And wow I was amazed how the series keeps you glued on happens next.Set in 1983, and it feels like it was made in that decade, the filmmakers even use an 80's like soundtrack. The story is quite an awesome mystery each episode is like puzzle you slowly put together. An awesome blend of horror and sci-fi. The actors all play there parts really well, David Harbour is great has the sheriff, times he comes across like a ticking time bomb just waiting to go off. Winona Ryder is great has a mother, don't care what other people say about her performance, I thought she really delivered. And the other young actors are awesome here, they all just keep you watching. And now I'm waiting for season 2."
2051,"This is a mash-up of Goosebumps series, with a dash of cult and a generous flashback to the 80's. Reminds me of The Goonies. Reminds me of E.T. Reminds me of M83.It's confusing at first - I'm 33. So I can relate with everything here.One of the kid looks like Macaulay Culkin. Familiar. The chief is like a lovechild of young Jack Nicholson and Dexter (Michael C. Hall). Winona Ryder looks like Winona Ryder. ""Should I stay or should I go?"" and many other synth M83-like sound. Bald, adorable, bad-ass girl escaping from lab. The monster is ... basic monster you'd imagine whenever you read teen horror novels. Tacky and predictable ending.So I'm confuse whether this is for teenagers or adults like me.On the fair side - it's nice and entertaining. I like how I don't have to think too much and just enjoy those cute kids running around in the forest chasing monsters. Makes me miss my childhood and how I used to enjoy those cheesy Goosebumps serials."
2052,"Honestly, although this show definitely has a homage to old movies and books, it's more original than most shows you will see today. I love the feel of the show, it definitely has that vintage ""80's-90s"" feel to it. And i love that the only ""big"" star is Winona Ryder (sorry if spelt wrong) it makes it seem and feel real, despite the whole, evil monster, upside down world. The kids dress like kids and act like real kids which makes it all the more relatable and draws you in. It's so intense and thrilling. I'm not one to yell at the TV during a scary movie but this show had my attention. It reminds me of good old movies like ""stand by me"" or ""sandlot"" because its authentic to how kids act unlike shows hot in the media like ""fuller house"" where kids where bow ties and say ""holy chalupa"" instead they use actual language a kid of their age would or have actions that they would really make. It's not sugar coded and sex, drugs, alcohol, bullying and much much more are real. No one is perfect and that's what really hits home, that's what makes it original. And even when you see the monster it's not completely fake looking like in most horror films now. Most shows now are the same thing over and over again; perfect family, perfect house, drama drama drama, perfect hair, ugly mixed matched clothes that are supposed to be cool, perfect kids who do no wrong. It's annoying. Everyone is also, honestly, a pretty good actor/ actress. The acting isn't so robotic. And the mystery keeps you so invested. They give you enough in each episode to really keep you interested and intrigued. Very much hope there is more to come in another season."
2053,"Okay, so I like the way season 3 went. The ""invasion of the body snatchers"" theme was great. Then the Russians were part of a major conspiracy. Finally, all the kids are growing up and getting mushy. The new Father/Daughter dynamic between Hopper and Eleven was priceless. Watching him struggle with her dating someone was the classic cliche.The direction was great and there was a bit of a sneak peek for season 4 as they showed us something crazy during credits. The thing that caught my attention most was when they were grabbing a prisoner the soldier to the back said, ""No, not the American,"" and then the other soldier moved to the next door and pulled out a Russian prisoner instead. So who was in the original cell, the one he called ""The American""?!Can't wait for season 4!!!"
2054,The quality of everything in this series is top notch. An absolute must watch series.
2055,It is wonderful so you have to watch it again and again
2056,"Stranger Things, let's your imagination have fun!!"
2057,THIS IS THE GREATEST NETFLIX ORIGINAL OF ALL TIME!!! PURE GENIUS!!!
2058,Best series ever made....with every season netflix outdone itself and raise the bar ...u goona love it
2059,Season 1 is very bad and slow.. but the another seasons are perfect
2060,Really don't get the hype behind this show. All of season 1 had as much content as one x-files episode. Then the conclusion to season 1 was a low-budget anti-climactic scene that makes 50s b horror movies look realistic.
2061,"Stranger Things Full of package entertainment, thrilling and suspense. Unique & Fresh Concept. SEASON 1 & Season 2 is lit but season 3 is not well previous last 2 seasons. Overall Season 3 First 3 episodes story not very good after 3 Episodes Story & Plot on the track.
Overall In My Opinion, Stranger Things Is must Watch TV Series.
My Personal Rating Season Wise:
S01: 10/10
S02: 10/10
S03: 8.5/10"
2062,"Why all the hate for season 3. The kids are growing up, they're going to change. Great trilogy"
2063,Season one was okay and then season 2 I couldn't keep myself from not paying attention. Season 3 has taken me a few tries to finish the first episode. It seriously amazes me how much hype and love this disaster of a series brings in. It's like it's designed for for woman/feminist audiences not trying to sound sexist but if you don't see it you're definitely blind.
2064,"It's the perfect tonic for a world drunk on nostalgia that also needs to see something wholesome about a traumatized pre-teen girl with psychic powers, who has the world's greatest support system behind her. It wouldn't be where it is without its wealth of talented actors and the eye for talent of the Duffer brothers."
2065,"So good! Always looking for that next, great tv experience that seldom comes around, but discovered in ""Stranger Things"". Finally, a story that has characters that you genuinely care about. Storylines that leave you breathless, whether by thrilling action or extreme emotion, this series has it all. And if you happen to be a child of the 80's, then prepare for a nostalgic trip back to a simpler time. A mind blowing time trip of thrills and fun adventure. One that you will not soon forget."
2066,"I'm so glad I've got to see 3 seasons of this groundbreaking Netflix gem, except the last season I've watched with my best friend over at his house. I've waited so long to see this beloved hit since I became enthusiastic some time before season 2 premiered in the fall of 2017 after watching the promo for it during the Super Bowl. It was also the time I was quite fascinated with the filmography of Justin Benson and Aaron Moorhead. Boy! This show is really something! In the first season, we see Will Byers getting kidnapped by the Demogorgon and taken into the Upside Down before we are introduced to one of everyone's favorite character, Eleven who possesses awesome psychic abilities. Taking place one year of Will's abduction and Eleven's disappearance, Will begins to experience terrifying visions of the Upside Down, only to discover there's even a more dangerous threat, the Mind Flayer who then possesses Will, only for him to feel the same pain as the bleak remains of the Upside Down being burnt by fire. One peculiar summer, Will's best friends Mike, Lucas, Dustin and Eleven are now teenagers dealing with growing pains as the new Starcourt Mall becomes the small town of Hawkins, Indiana as a familiar threat begins to dwell from underneath. As a fan of this series as well as the ever beloved cult classic comic book series ""Scott Pilgrim"", I am trying to start on my indie graphic novel series called ""Motor Rock Romance"" which also takes place in the 1980s and revolves around a teenage outcast, his best friend as well as his new girlfriend who begin to face deadly, otherworldy threats that want to consume our whole galaxy!
Well, can't wait for the 4th season to come!"
2067,"Stranger things - This show will blow your mind all the way ; it's like a rollercoaster ride - once you get in there's no way out ! You'll laugh , cry , thrilled , and will amazed at same time ! At the end of the season you'll find that all the characters are more familiar . The essence of the characters will stay with you even after the end of the show ! Just go for it because it's not just a web series ; it's an emotion!"
2068,"One of the best shows on netflix. Great story,suspense,ect."
2069,"The movie or show series is rather long, and entertaining like a happiness that is well fought. A time comes to those that wander the lake of happiness like sorrow because of us. Others are obviously not ready for learning the craft of an original series spoiler.
Winoma Ryder is brilliant along with all the other beautiful ladies alike. But, knowing that I heard about STRANGER THINGS and decided that it should and will be our last review ever. Tasted like momos only for the two'ers and not a group sex.
Your point both ways like that in three years!"
2070,"This show makes me feel like kid, I liked to watch movies and shows from 80/90 as kid, simply love it. Like when I started to watch X-Files in 95, 24years after still in love with it, and same could be with Stranger Things. Hope they will not rush too much with story. Show is brilliant, make it last."
2071,My favourite tv show.Good caracters good story.Waiting for season 4
2072,"OMG! I'm so glad I watched the show! And at the perfect moment too! Right after I finished, it seems, others did too, and they started talking about it on the social media, making it gain more popularity. But overall, the feel, the character development, the screenplay, acting, dialogues, everything was just so amazing, that it attracts the user immediately.The show is spooky, but not scary, escapist but not empty.There was definitely some connection for me. That might bed to its 80s setting, with the throwback to the simpler times, with the heroes, villains and monsters. It reminded me of the time when I was a kid and dreamt about saving the world and going on adventures.With is hauntingly apt music and background score, and amazing performances, it's hard to feel you're not a part of the setting. And the storyline, which in itself is enough to captivate the audience is present very well.The show adapts its style from the 80s pop culture and draws inspiration from the storytellers of the celluloid. And the directors have done than perfectly. You get that Stephen King, Steven Spielberg feel to the whole show. And the truth is, you haven't realized that you missed this from your life, that 80s story feel, until you actually watch this show! You realize how badly you needed it in your life!The acting is simply marvelous. Elven with that big eyed shaved head (I can't believe how hard it must be to convince an eleven year old girl to shave her head!) feel has done a marvelous job of acting. There's a scene where she enters the rooms of a regular teenage girl, and the way she gasps, and her eyes pop open as she opens a musical box, just says it all about her acting skills. Winona Ryder, all the new kids, everyone, has given marvelous performances, which never, not even for a single moment, let you think that they are faking anything. It all seems so real.The storyline, beyond the amazing Easter eggs and references to the 80s pop culture, is intriguing and mysterious enough to draw the audience towards it. Besides being haunting, the show has a rare respect for both adult grief and childhood suffering. It's definitely an original.Definitely a must watch for everyone, and well worth and deserving of it's rating!"
2073,"The cast is wonderful, each character is charming in their own way and the plot is really intriguing! This show might be thrilling but it's also funny and wholesome at times.
I was hooked from episode one, and the following seasons did not disappoint. Honestly do not get all the complaints about season 3, I mean it was entertaining and the plot was interesting, really loved the character development as well! This is more than a scary story, by now I'd say viewers are invested in these characters, so it was nice to watch them grow and face challenges other than supernatural entities. Definitely worth the watch!"
2074,"If your into 80s and si fi horror comedy. Then this is for you, season 1 to 3 are just as good as each other in their own way. I don't get the hate for season 3 as if anything I think it's the better one with more comedy which i thought was brilliantly written. People need to lighten up and stop craving for attention for something that isn't bad at all. The star rating for this series speaks for it self.
So sit back and enjoy as you won't be disappointed."
2075,"It is amazing. I watcht 2 seasons in 5 days. As a huge Natalia Dyer fan
Was Nancy truely my favorite. And the realationships was so wheel done. And the charecthers was so good. The idea of season 3 being so defrent was great. There also came New charecthers to The show, like Max and Robin. Just brings more into the show. It is now one of my farvorite shows"
2076,"Great season. Awesome finale.
Special thanks for the ""Neverending Story"".
I was Born on 1982. It was one of my favorite fairy tales. Thank you for bringing me back to childhood!P.S. Russians are awesome. I am telling you like a true Siberian! We in Russia laughed very much. Thank you!
P.P.S Alexey died. Very sad. Were worried about his fate very much."
2077,This show is really good and fun to watch it doesnt have an ep where u will get bored not even a sec and they kept their momentum so far i hope they keep it that way.besides that season 3 is really different in a georgous way then the first 2 they really topped them well watch it and u will know why.
2078,Netflix has done really well on stranger things because of the young age of the actors and the rest of the cast on there acting. The story line is also really good.
2079,"Many Many spoilers aheadThe latest installment of ""Stranger Things"" (NETFLIX, July 4, 2019) from Matt and Ross Duffer, is fun to watch, to say the least. It is a huge improvement over ""Stranger Things 2"". The kids are getting older and so, therefore, the stories are becoming darker with even more danger. This season, the Duffer brothers spend more time with the adults of Hawkins Indiana where in season 2 was spent showcasing Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown). Don't get me wrong, I love Ms. Brown's performance. She is a wonderful actress and has created one of the most interesting and beloved characters on television to date. Perhaps, the time spent on this one character was the thing to do. We got to learn more about Eleven and how she got to be a test subject at the Hawkins National Laboratory. In a detour to Chicago, we learned there were more test subjects out there. We met Kali (Linnea Berthelsen), test subject number Eight who has even stronger powers than Eleven. Maybe all this will make sense in ""Stranger Things 4"" when we might see the other test subjects from the Hawkins National Laboratory show up to help El with her next encounter with the Upside Down.A few observations, some of which were mentioned here by other viewers. The comments referenced the term ""PC"" for Political Correctness, at least I think that is what they were going for. ""Stranger Things"" takes place in the mid-1980s. It is about flawed people dealing with everyday problems that sometimes go to the extreme. Topics such as one's sexual orientation, race, or women's equality were not openly discussed or easily accepted as it is today. One viewer commented about the acceptance of a black boy or even girls into their small group that just happens to be nerds that spend all their free time playing Dungeons & Dragons. Being outcasts in 1985, these boys did not pay attention to race or if someone was a boy or girl, they just wanted to have fun enjoying the things they all had in common. The brothers got the treatment of women in the workplace right. The humiliation that Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer) had to endure while working at the Hawkins Post was right on even if it was a little overplayed.Among the many reasons, being Politically Correct is why we see a lot of strong ""kick-ass"" women in films these days. Which is great, but does this impact the creativeness of filmmakers when they produce period films such as ""Stranger Things""? In the 1980s and 90s, these exceptional women were made to stay in the shadows because women were not supposed to be smart or independent. Can you imagine what would happen to Nancy if she stood up to those bullies in the newsroom?The Marvel Universe gave us Agent Peggy Carter played brilliantly by Hayley Atwell. Agent Carter was part of the team in the 1940s that transformed Steve Rogers into Captain America. She was described as a brilliant ""badass"" part agent part scientist that could hold her own in any situation. These are the traits we see in Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder), Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown), Max Mayfield (Sadie Sink), Robin (Maya Hawke), and even little Erica Sinclair (Priah Ferguson) the ten-year-old little sister to Lucas Sinclair (Caleb McLaughlin). These are the ladies that save Hawkins from the monsters of the Upside-Down once again.Here are other observations we saw this season. Will Byers (Noah Schnapp), after playing such a huge part in ""Stranger Things 2"", his role was rather limited this time around. Will wants things to go back to the way it was before he was whisked away to the Upside Down. Before Eleven showed up. Before the Mind Flayer possessed his body. The comment from Mike to Will, ""It's not my fault you don't like girls . . . yet,"" left many viewers wondering if the missing word ""yet"" was intentional? Russian spies in the middle of Hawkins? Why are they wearing uniforms if they are to remain hidden? With the end of the Cold War just around the corner, how was this huge underground complex built in middle America without anyone being the wiser? At the hospital, what's with the RED M&M? This is 1985, more than a year before the MARS company included the any Red dye in their candies. Does Chief Hopper really need to chain-smoke? Does he really need to take his anger out on the kids? But again this was the 1980s before second-hand smoke was considered to be a problem and yelling at children was how discipline was handed out. Although, he did manage to kick-ass with the guy that looked an awful lot like the TERMINATOR. I have a feeling that guy might be back.On the plus side. It was great to spend more time with adults. The chemistry between Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) and Jim Hopper (David Harbour) was refreshing even with the constant bickering between them. The banter between Scoops Ahoy employees Steve Harrington (Joe Keery) and Robin (Maya Hawke) was very entertaining. And of course, the camaraderie between Steve and Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo) continues as it did in ""Stranger Things 2"". All three characters just seemed to click when they got together to decode the Russian transmissions. The blossoming romance between Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard) and Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) was nice to see continue and then watch it change along the way after Eleven and Max spent the day at the Starcourt Mall just being teenagers. It was great to see Millie Bobby Brown's fashion sense carry over to her character Eleven. I was not a fan of Max Mayfield's stepbrother, Billy Hargrove (Dacre Montgomery) in ""Stranger Things 2"". He was absolutely horrible to his little sister Max and that's pretty much all the actor (Dacre) was given to do. That evilness made it easy to accept him as the villain when he was possessed by the Mind Flayer. In the end, however, Billy had enough humanity left in him to save Eleven from what would have been certain death.Ignoring the logical fallacies ""Strange Things 3"" is fun to watch. While some of the episodes moved slowly, the viewers had time to understand what was happening to the characters. With so many things happening, the Duffer brothers juggled the four plot lines masterfully. We had to keep track of the Russians, the teenage angst, Hopper and Joyce, and the creatures from the Upside Down. All of this had to come together in a nice little package in chapter 8, The Battle of Starcourt. It was a nice touch and perhaps a little corny, but the song ""Never Ending Story"" sung by Dustin and Suzie (Gabriella Pizzolo) turned into the never-ending song.The kids are growing up and moving on, the series has to grow as well and the Duffer brothers are allowing that to happen. When the kids were younger, of course, they were coddled a bit. In ""Stranger Things 2"" we saw how dangerous El's powers can be. This season, she and the rest of the gang were allowed to experience death first-hand, love, angry people, gay people, and painful goodbyes. Eleven and Max lost a lot this season. They both lost people they loved and cared for. Neither one of the people they lost were perfect, but they were all they had. The children grew up alone and isolated with only one parent or in El's case no parents. Otherwise, both of these girls will grow up to become exceptional young ladies which I hope we get to see as ""Stranger Things"" continues. It was a solemn moment to watch the Byers pack up and leave Hawkins. Even if there were not a ""Stranger Things 4"" the last fifteen minutes of chapter 8 gives us closure. If we never go back to Hawkins, that would be fine with me. I think there is enough story with Eleven, the Byers, Kali (test subject number Eight), and of course Nancy and Jonathan. Maybe Max could come to visit or even move in with the Byers for more fun and adventures."
2080,"Just love this series , watch you will not be disappointed , it's for everyone ."
2081,But full of over acting by Joyce. All over a must watch TV series
2082,"It Is a good series
We are waiting the last part of this series
Thanks"
2083,I've seen the trailer a year ago ... and recently this tv series came to my mind and I started watching from the beginning I love it and in these days I'm watching season 2 lol... I love Netflix woooww !!! Great...
2084,Enjoyed Stranger Things to a point. Just couldn't get past the fact it's been ripped off from Stephen King's It.
2085,"I really was afraid that this second season could ruin a fantastic story, as is often the case, but I have to admit I really liked it. I love that the reactions of characters are never discounted, love their humor and in general the ability to develop different characters without losing the main thread"
2086,"Hands down the best show I've ever watched. Amazing character development, unpredictable story line and absolutely stellar acting. Very unique; Netflix nailed it. Season 1 was a little slow at first but once you get into it, you won't be able to stop!!!! I absolutely love the boys' little ""party"" and the 80s small town theme gives the show a slightly more eerie and dark mood. Season 2 was just as good as season 1 if not better, a lot more suspenseful and dark. Mike and Eleven's love has me dead."
2087,"I'm up to chapter four now and so I thought I'd put down in words what just dawned on me. A few chapters earlier a couple of scenes stuck in my mind and it didn't click until the fourth chapter. This really reminds me of the PlayStation game Silent Hill. Not 100% but there are a lot of similarities and to me that's good.Really enjoying it. As the story unfolds it becomes clearer and definitely more addictive.A few old cliche's, done before sub plots and back stories but they take nothing away from the overall enjoyment.Now back to chapter five."
2088,"I binged-watched all of the episodes. It is very classically Stephen King. The protagonists are the loser children in school, weirdo Jonathan managing to win over popular girl Nancy's affections, the traumatized middle-aged cowboy Hopper discovering conspiracy theories are real, and there are absolutely no worthy Asian characters in the whole thing. But again, people don't read Stephen King to be inspired about social stereotypes, or to enjoy literary creativity. They read to get some commercially guaranteed thrill. By that standard I think this series score the goal perfectly. I really like Eleven. Millie Bobby Brown made her lovable but alien. It was clear that Eleven was in unimaginable pain, which crippled her senses as a normal child. I really love Eleven and Mike's little relationship episode. Only beings as pure-hearted as children can truly allow themselves to love something they don't understand. It was also heartbreaking that although she kept thinking about other people's welfares, nobody really thought about hers. Chief Hop sold her to her 'papa' in no time, even though he knew she definitely didn't want to go back there. Joyce held her and assured her like a mother when she was helping to find Will, but she was also glad to see her return to a life time of traumatizing experiments. Nobody except Mike ever opened their hearts to her, then the lost of her life was dealt with such ease and spontaneity, which made me really sad. Joyce's story was supposed to be a very touching one. She insisted on what she thought was right even though the whole world told her otherwise. I was really moved when she set up the Christmas lights around the alphabet. It was a smartness manifested through desperation driven by fanatic love, and it is always moving in whatever backdrop. But her hysterical screaming grew a little tiresome after a while. It didn't feel real. She so insistently complained to everyone about losing a child that it almost seemed like she sought satisfaction from the action itself. Like she was enjoying her tragic-mother story-plot. If she ever looked tired when dealing with people it would look a lot more real. The villains are ridiculous. All they ever do was doing experiments or driving around in expensive cars. They had no emotional depth and felt really hollowed out. But for a middle- aged fantasy with evil government and secret human experiments, more depth could not have been attempted since the fantasy itself was stupid and shallow and too exploited. Except for those, flow of the story was flawless and really consuming. I am not immune to stories of smart middle-schoolers so it was really fascinating to me. I attribute the effect this show has on me to excellent directing. The monster looked gross, scary but really video game-ish. I didn't understand why it's proved there were two demogorgans there couldn't be more. If I were the Byers I would move out of the house and settle somewhere out of the triangular zone, and told everyone else in the zone to move away."
2089,"There were some very nice aspects of Stranger Things. Personally, I was watching it for the sci-fi angle. It was more of an X-Files/Goonies/Beverly Hills 90210. The X-Files/Firestarter likeness was cool. Even the Goonies/E.T. type style was OK. The Beverly Hills 90210 teenage drama was sickening. I don't care who likes who, who's sleeping with who or who a sweet young girl is going to lose her virginity to. That very unnecessary aspect of the show very nearly ruined it.Well, that and Winona Ryder--she was awful. I couldn't take the show seriously whenever they put her exaggerated mug on the screen. Goodness, she was such a caricature. I didn't know if she was going for comedy, crazy or an Oscar. She greatly overplayed the distressed-I'm-not-crazy mother role. She was terrible. Strip away the teen love component and Winona Ryder then this was a solid sci-fi series. It's 1983 and a young kid named Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) goes missing. The mom, Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) is convinced that he's alive and nearby. Coupled with that strange disappearance a young girl named Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) shows up and is able to do some real Professor X-type stuff.The show centers around four distinct characters: Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard), young nerd and leader of his pack. Joyce Byers, distressed mother. Jim Hopper (David Harbour), town sheriff and relentless searcher. Nancy Wheeler (Natalia Dyer), confused teenager in love looking for her friend. As I stated before; two of the characters' stories I couldn't care less about and the other two were the meat and potatoes for me. More bizarre happenings and less soap opera drama and it is a lot better show."
2090,"We are in the 80s, in the small American town of Hawking, when Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) mysteriously disappears. In the meantime a little girl (Millie Bobby Brown) without a name is found by Mike Wheeler (Finn Wolfhard). All of these events seem to be connected and what starts as a simple missing person case slowly evolves into creating a chain of events that will find Hawking's police chief Jim Hopper (David Harbour) joining forces with Will's mother Joyce (Winona Ryder) to uncover what is really going on.Admittedly, that plot synopsis doesn't cover even half of it, but there is no need to know anything going into this, I went in without having literally any idea what this was going to be and, just like the rest of the world, ""Stranger Things"" caught me deeply and by surprise. I was not expecting the best season of television I have seen in the last years.This is incredible storytelling, this is the next big thing, a voice so original and unique you are swept away by the power of the emotional narrative. I will quote a sentence that sums up the show so perfectly it is hard not to bring it up: ""in Stranger Things the kids are in a Spielberg film, the teens in a Carpenter film and the adults are in a Stephen King film"". That basically outlines the brilliance of the show in one sentence. The molding of tones and atmospheres is seamless, at no point I felt like the creators were bluntly copying off of any of their inspirations.Many have talked about how this show is such an homage to the 80s and the storytellers of that time, but I think that that comes into play only as a consequence of the storytelling, which is why it works. The first thing these writers worry about nailing is the characters and what an incredible ensemble we are presented to. There are no stereotypes, no clichés, no archetypal figures, every single on of these people is three dimensional, we get behind every character, we believe in their world and we root for them. The complexity of the dynamics that is brought to life with such clarity is indicative of the evident passion the creators had for this project.The scene weave is just unbelievable, how plot and story manage to forward each other, building a building a narrative that grows and culminates in a beautiful resolution which once again avoids any type of predictions and presents itself as original as the whole series. Anyone accusing the writers of having excessively borrowed from the 80s is only trying to bit*h around. The originality of the series is unbelievable and it is sure to produce a great deal of imitators, just as every time such a new and fresh voice comes to life.The writing merits here are off the charts, definitely something worth studying, and the directors deserve deep recognition for how brilliantly and completely the vision on the page is brought to the screen. The cinematography is so stylish, it molds 80s dynamics with modern technology without ever calling attention to itself. The score and soundtrack could not have been more spot on. The theme of the show encapsulates perfectly what the whole thing is about, it nails it down perfectly and when that theme is heard for the first time you will know you are in for something special.What it also comes down to is how powerful the themes explored are thanks to a story world that lends itself so brilliantly to them. This is one of the best portrayed friendships of recent years, but the themes go well beyond that. The power of love over hate is a theme that is carried over into all of the story lines and has different manifestations in all of them and when they are all brought together the impact on the viewer is truly special. Other than being so smart and affectionate, the series was probably most memorable for me for how moving it was in its small yet powerful moments.And we haven't even started talking about the actors yet. Whilst every single one of them deserves loads of praise on his or her own, for me the scene stealer is hands down David Harbour. I did not know he was this good of an actor, this is world class acting. He brings to life a character, subverting every possible expectation we had about him and ultimately creating a person that feels incredibly real. The only complaint I have is that Winona Ryder struggled through the first half of the show being very one note and giving a flat portrayal of her struggles.""Stranger Things"" was incredible, it was overwhelming in its originality and whilst I am still not sure on whether I want a season two or not, I will forever cherish the experience I had with this treasure of a tale."
2091,"The acting and the settings are awesome, I agree, but let's be honest, if this was not on Netflix, nobody would talk about it. It is not scary and I don't like horrors too much, and the plot with the kids seems very childish. It's not boring, but sometimes trying to be too atmospheric and it gets annoying with the blinking lights etc. I don't know, it was not bad, but I know about tons of better series. I feel like very little thing around the main plot is nailed, the atmosphere is awesome, but the plot itself seems average. I hate some parts with the kids, where it all seems forced, and the ending was very predictable. 7/10 is what I would give it."
2092,"Season 1 of Stranger Things is about a boy that went missing, a secret government agency, and a monster. It is obvious the writers of the show are fans of 80s era horror. There were enough allusions and homages that even the densest person would pick up on one. That it felt like a Stephen King story, adapted by Dean Koontz, and directed by Steven Spielberg is hardly a bad thing. At only eight episodes, this does not seem like a show that is padded. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The story with Joyce (Winona Ryder) became redundant once she and Hopper (David Harbour) joined forces. The only consistency this series has is with the children. Their story is the driving force behind the series, and anything else just felt off. All in all, this is a decent show, and well worth wasting an afternoon or two watching."
2093,"The show isnt bad, but it lacks of logic in many things to make belivable the story, it has a lot of failures, and a show of a 8,9 rating, doesnt have to have failures to own that rating, so, I think reviewers rated this show just for the lot of publicity and trending and posers, but I think any smart person knows this show doesnt deserve a note above 6, so, I gave it a 1 to make the real ranking more fair :)"
2094,Binge watch it right away if you haven't watched it already
2095,"I have just finished watching season 1, 2 and 3 after about a 2-month non-stop binging fest and I loved the show. The characters were really good (especially Dustin), the settings were interesting and the lines were just awesome! Before you renew your Netflix subscription, watch this as you'll be hooked!"
2096,"Has almost all the things. Suspense, mystery, romance, first loves, family, funny & scary. I recommend for everyone over the age 13. Especially fellow children of the 80's like myself."
2097,This show is great from start to finish great cast cant wait for season 4
2098,Season one was amazing and seasons 2-3 have not failed to deliver. Enjoy that they went with the summer time frame on this season rather then an expected fall/halloween.
2099,"There is NOTHING quite like Stranger Things. It is full of amazing Sci-fi goodness, with nostalgic elements, making it an amazingly fresh and exciting watch. It's up there with my favourite shows."
2100,Just when I thought this show might run out of steam - it keeps on going better than ever. Hope there is a season 4 in the works. Do it quick before the kids get too old.
2101,"Amazing story, badass characters, heartbreaking events, creepy monsters, heartwarming friendship and relatioships, also a really good music and outfits from the 80's."
2102,"I liked all the seasons this is by far the best show on Netflix, but for me the first and second season isn't a repeating show for me the third season yes, but I would watch the show like once a month (the whole show). I loved everyone who was casted in it, the story, and the whole thing. I would recommend this to everyone I know."
2103,From the best 25 series ever and it deserves more rating than this
2104,"Great writing, great acting. So fun to watch. Loved every episode. For all those who leave low reviews, can you do better? NOPE. Negative reviews should not be excepted if you've never written an award winning tv show or movie. Just enjoy it and leave your negative thoughts to yourself. Great season!! Thank you for creativity. Those who gave a low review couldn't do better."
2105,"So much awesomeness in this show. I've cried, been relieved and at times almost sick from the producers uncanny way of creating ""strange things"".10 stars to a series that keeps me watching all the way through to the next and gets me into a range of vast emotionality. Each season is excellent. The kids are phenomenal actors. I miss the 80's- so this aids in that touch of nostalgia. 10 star reviews like this are rare for me, I value my time, but this is so very worth it.-Mom of two kids, age 34."
2106,"This is the best show I've gotten hooked on in a loooooong time!Every bit of it was amazing. The kids were great, the storyline was interesting and the entire series never got dull. I loved seeing each character transform from episode 1 until the end of season 3 and am now dying for a season 4.Not only was it amazing, but it was actually emotional at times too. The connection between characters seemed so real and to think the actors were so young! It blew my mind how well they could make you feel those emotions.There really isn't much else I can say other than it is absolutely spectacular and has me wanting so much more!!"
2107,I will get it done and I will get it done and get it done before I get done with it done and I will get it done
2108,"The Delivery of the Story is superb, on an age of in your face CG and effects. Stranger things focuses on imaginative ways of telling a story that is easily relate able and .."
2109,"As season the season 3 closing titles roll to an end, I find myself asking the same question I've asked after every season. Is the story really any good, or do we just enjoy the amazing cast chemistry and 80's nostalgia?I have to admit I lean more to the latter. The show is great fun and the cast have really won the hearts of the public worldwide and have delivered some great performances. The 80's nostalgia is rife and being a 80's child it's certainly a welcome addition that brings back fond memories.But the story is rather nonsensical and implausible, Jim Hopper seems to be the only member of law enforcement in the whole town. Faced with an entire Russian army he doesn't feel the need to call any police back up, the military? Equally the kids and parents seem only too willing to throw themselves into danger at every turn.It reminds me of the ill fated show Invasion (2005) where despite everyone knowing something was going on, nobody thought to raise the alarm outside of their small town. Stranger Things certainly has the same shortcomings but with a cast so charming and watchable and with those 80's backdrops and soundtracks we're more willing to turn a blind eye.It's great TV for now, I'm not sure it will hold up to scrutiny too far into the future though."
2110,"This show is so much fun, Its score, to its music, to its action! It is a hell of a ride to the 80s"
2111,Better than xfiles 😂😂😂 or any of it🔥🔥🔥 a movie for kids(no way kidding 😂😂😂not for kids)🔥🔥🔥🔥♥♥❤❤❤❤
2112,"Season 2 was a huge improvement over the first, which was a surprising success last year. All characters of Hawkins were woven beautifully with the spurious events from the Hawkins lab. The creators of the show could have easily made an incremental progress and the second season would have still been successfully. However, credit should be give to the Duffer brothers & Netflix for really escalating matters. Season 1 had a Goonies or E.T. vibe to it. meaning, in spite of the lurking monster there was a cheerful excitement. Season 2 on the other hand has a much scarier and dark tone to it, like Aliens or Predator. You feel the tension even from the private lives of returning characters. The story arc of the main characters was progressed successfully this season. Among the kids, Will Byers who was rescued from the Upside down is experiencing 'visions' of possibly the mother monster. His family, friends and Sheriff Hopper are trying had to move on. In other side, Nancy is still reeling under guilt about her friend Barb's fate. This has strained her relationship with Steve. And last, but not the least it is Eleven who is hurting the most. She has not yet recovered from previous events, moreover she gets even troubled with her identity & place in the world. More details on this turn towards the Spoilers' domain. The monster thread is beautifully handled. The action scenes involving them have been shot on a cinematic scale: all scenes were framed nice, even the sound, score & CGI is top notch. The threat this time is more amorphous than last time so that you feel its tension even when its not present. The highlight of this season are again Eleven and her friends. They have carried this season on their shoulders. It is no secret that the show makes direct references to 80s movies. Still, the performance of each actor has added value to every scene. All in all, Stranger things 2 has been a great cinematic experience. I can only imagine the fun in watching it on a larger 4K screen, which is now the standard format for all Netflix produstions."
2113,"But, at the end of the day, they just couldn't really bring the story to the next level. All this mystery about this alternate reality and the creatures who dwell there. And in the end, we are given but one answer to it all:Nazis.I suppose it began with Star Wars with the Empire wearing SS uniforms or something, but it really is getting old. Surely, there has to be something that motivates creatures to do bad things besides some desire for genocide. No one even knew what the word genocide was until 1950. Maybe start with everything written from before 1900? When you watch a Marvel film, you expect this. The Marvel guys have all admitted as such. But years of watching all this, all the mystery that built up, and that's all we get. Nazis."
2114,"The quality of the series is exceptional, everyone agrees on that. Filming, actors, all the things you can see are of the best quality.But today we have access to information, and don't believe in supernatural stories anymore, things we didn't know 20 years ago.So there's no point in cultivating theories long gone, not even for fun. I'm sure there are many good real world stories to be told. Most people live in a world of fantasy and will like the series.The series are cute, but just pure fantasy. If you came here for recommendation, as a rational person, I recommend not to watch, even though it's like The Goonies. Still not good enough.I hope that Netflix and others make more series on this 80's style, but with a proper story. 6 out of 10. Watchable once."
2115,"Stranger Things is a original Netflix series. Expetations were high and hype was real. Well, Netlfix truly nailed it and this was worth of hype. This series had elements of E.T, X-Files, Twin Peaks, Stand By Me and many 80s high school movies. Great mixture and true nostalgia trip to the 80s. I have always been a very special relationship with sci-fi and horror so I think that's why I liked this so much. This is like a Spielberg style adventure and Stephen King style horror. Yep this show is sometimes very terrifying and not for the little kids.One of the biggest makers of Stranger Thing's awesomeness are truly spectacular acting performanes. This is like Game of Thrones. Everyone do breathtaking work to adults to the kids. I have to mention that I strongly believe that Millie Bobby Brown (who plays Eleven) will be a huge star in the future. Also David Harbour (who plays Hopper) is amazing. And everyone else. Winona Ryder makes a huge comeback to the top and this is her best performance in a long long time.I loved this show and i can't wait to see second season. English is not my mother tongue so sorry for possibly few mistakes."
2116,"Once I started the show, I just couldn't get myself to stop, even when I wanted to. It's almost like I was glued to the chair and hooked completely. It's extremely binge-able and I've been sitting here for the past 10 hrs (I think), just eating up one episode after another.There's nothing I have to say about the show, characters, the setting or soundtrack. Everything is top-notch, as is expected. It is a wild ride to the end-of-the-world with (some) minor goofs here and there, but ignore that, there's nothing in TV that's as hooking as this season.Personally, I enjoyed this season of Stranger things the best and this now takes the place of one of my most enjoyed shows that I have seen.Thanks a lot, Netflix! For making our weekends awesome."
2117,One of the special about this series is they film in 80s style!!
2118,"I remember when I first watched the show I couldn't stop thinking about it for a month. It was the only thing I could talk about. It leaves you craving more. The writing, cinematography, directing even acting are all out standing. If you're a big fan of the 80s there's no way you're not gonna love this. Please watch it. You WILL NOT REGRET IT. The end of season 3 left fans in tears and was the most heart breaking scene from any TV show in a long time. The show is like a roller coaster it plays with your emotions. It gets you hooked from the very first episode."
2119,This is one of my best series I've ever seen. Thanks to the creators. Hope the season never ends. NEVER.
2120,"The 80's are nostalgic for us all for a specific reason of which no one can quite put their finger on...socialization. We were social back then and this review will delve into why we love Stranger Things so much and how we can get back to such an era.In the 80's there were no cell phones, no Netflix or anything of the sort.Consequently there is a Dead Mall Series with This is Dan Bell illustrating the decline of modern civilization.As, being civil towards one another is what is most certainly in decline.You see, when you don't have the largest building in the world towards which to congregate by the thousands for free if you so do desire called a mall, then, socialization begins to break down and you see all the malls across the United States begin to die.When you went to Blockbuster Video it was an experience, 3,500 stores allowed you to walk in, ask the guy behind you if he'd seen this movie and start a conversation about movies of which you can't really do outside at a big red box.Socialization. The couch inside, the lights around the posters, the excitement, the experience of the 80's.The 80's were perfect. We didn't need cell phones back then and life went on just fine. Actually, truth be told, better than fine, we weren't blanketed in BlueTooth & 5G signals causing everyone headaches of which they don't believe are causing them headaches so they can continue putting up towers of which are causing everyone headaches as though these unnatural devices did not interfere with our own electromagnetic field.In the 80's they were at a minimum, just enough to have some fun yet still not invasive enough to drive everyone mad.This is why we love the 80's so much and why we miss the 80's and why I'm about to travel back in time to the 80's.Of course you, dear reader, do not have the ability quite yet to believe such an activity as time travel to be possible, however, soon you will discover there is a lot more to this Earth....well...than meets the eye."
2121,"ATTENTION TO ALL OF YOU WHO LIVED YOU'RE YOUTH IN YEARS 80, liked movies like Goonies, Portergeist, The Evil Dead, The Thing, Alien(s), Star Wars, ET, Clouse Encounters of the Third Degree, Indiana Jones, It - Stephen King, Lord of the Rings (ok, this is newer, but the books are older and the references are all there) and so many other fantastic and unbeatable classics of that magic decade. I have to say: Watch THIS, STRANGER THINGS! Oh really. Watch it. But watch accordingly: at night, turn off your mobile, whats-app, Facebook, Instagram, blah blah blah, watch as you should watch every movie, with immersion, transport yourself into the adventure, and I assure you, you will remember how it used to be, when going to the movies itself was already an adventure. You will be transported to the 80's. Cool characters, family dramas, pure and sincere friendships among nerd, intelligent, and excluded children, teenage's dramas, music and soundtrack of the 80s, in every detail, from the suspense in songs of each scene, the opening song and title of the series, the soundtrack, the references/homage to the 80's is very strong, very clear. I loved it. For me, it is among the 2 best series I've seen in the last 10 years, with only Game of Thrones at the same level. I cannot think of any other that has given me so much pleasure to watch, which has given me the desire to watch again, and again, and again. No, not even Breaking Bad, Marvel's Daredevil, The Walking Dead, The Expanse (unknown by many, but i liked), NCIS, etc. I'm looking here at the list of series that I follow (around 50), and none is equal to the entertainment provided by this. Congratulations to the Duffer brothers. The series is amazing. Worth every minute."
2122,"A show that is able to encapsulate the feel of the 1980's in the 2010's and make it feel like something new at the same time gets a tip of the hat from me. Stranger Things features an engaging story, unique characters with great performances and three seasons of quality. The finale of season 3 is the best episode of this show I have seen yet. I am excited to see where the show goes from here
Season 1 > Season 2
Season 3 > Season 2
Season 1 > Season 3"
2123,Only just caught onto this show and am completely hooked. End of S3 got me into all sorts of emotions. 100% recommend for anyone looking to binge on a fully sick series.
2124,Stranger Things is a fresh breathe of air when it comes to TV programmes! It has amazing story writing and a great set of actors and actresses that well so well together. I have watch all seasons over and over.Overall it is a great TV show and I would recommend it to everyone!
2125,"What a show, can't say why but each season is riveting, characters are great, story lines original, all round epic show"
2126,"What an awesome show.
The suffer brothers delivered brilliant writing and directing, its more than safe to say that their episodes were the best in the show.
It has it all. It's mysterious, compelling, fun and emotional at the right moments.
As for the acting it was pretty solid with the child actors especially the performance by Gaten matarazzo.
But for me the real praise for acting goes to Dacre Montgomery. Every second of him on screen was absolute gold."
2127,"I love every thing about this series the story the actors the characters they are playing the direction the locations the customs and the david harbour
It absorbs you to it's atmosphere until you forget the world around you
Very very well done and the first season will always be the best"
2128,"Awesome casting, great writing, this show definitely deserves 10/10!!!!"
2129,"I really don't get what the excitement is about this series. For me, the plot stumbles from one cliché to the other (people may call it ""references to the 80's"" but forget that the 80's were the most boring period in the past 50 years). Acting is quite awful - Winona Ryder horrid. David Harbour is probably the best from the bunch. All the high school backdrop is awfully tedious and cliché-ridden. The merits of this series are only the cinematography (even though we've seen all those tricks before as well) and the way in which a certain level of suspense is effectively created. No need for a second season here. Please just cancel the show."
2130,I didn't make it through first season. Just a bunch of product placement. Nice photography sometimes. Generally - meaningless. ugly children All the way
2131,Best season yet! loved every minute.. have to watch it a second time to take everything in.
2132,"Season three started a little slow and sometimes a bit silly but after the direction of the season developed it moved right along. The new characters and villains were a needed touch to keep the series fresh and looking forward to season 4. Hopefully they already began filming as the kids are definitely maturing faster than production is taking place, which will soon impact the innocence factor of their main characters, which is a huge part of this show."
2133,"The most interesting things about this show are the characters. Since season 1 i fell in love with the characters. The only thing that made me to give 10/10 is the ending of season 3, the speech, the fact that Billy sacrificed to save the kids, Max being torn apart bu the death of his step brother. I need at least two more seasons. I just love those kids."
2134,"Awesome series highly recommended
the Netflix masterpiece"
2135,"Geniuses Matt Duffer, Ross Duffer ! Please I am begging bring more of this Style of horror style and atmoshpere music synth theme etc. It made me feel like i am back in time 80s when i was 12 watching stephen king etc. amazing works Duffer brothers ! Keep that style please please bring more out of this kind . It is very unique ! I can't wait . The Duffer Brothers ! You on the right path . Keep it coming !
:)"
2136,"I had a fear that maybe this season will possibly go wrong. Even GoT went mad in the latest and final season. So my expectations for this season was low but still, I waited a long time for it to release. Season 3 offers what exactly what the first two seasons offer. It is funny, emotional and nostalgic. The performances were superb and the making was no less than extraordinary. I had many favourite moments from this season but my most favourite thing was the Steve-Robin story arc. It was so good. This season was also unpredictable at times. Looking forward for season 4 as I'm pretty sure it will not disappoint."
2137,I really love this show the soundtrack is awesome. The characters and actors that play them are amazing!! 😊
2138,"I liked all 3 seasons of the show, admittedly watching season 3 I worried we'd suddenly get some kind of pc rubbish interfering with the story line (seems to be happening with a lot of shows recently!).However, the inclusiveness in two areas was done so well, it didn't feel like the writers were ramming it down your throat. (Perhaps they should give pointers to a few others out there!) I'm by no means against diversity of any kind, but when it's done to the detriment of the writing it does no favour to the actors involved or the show itself. If it had gone down the pc road, I'd not be looking forward to season 4😊This season continued the story line from seasons 1 and 2 well, the humour was well done and a welcome addition, without it I feel the season would have been a drag. Love love love love Hopper, to me he makes the show. The children turning into teens, was amusing and reminded me of my teens (I am after all a child of the 80s!)"
2139,"The children have grown up, this is quite obvious and even discussed explicitly in scenes from the play. Interests, ways of acting and interacting and the very relationship between the child nucleus (now adolescent) of the protagonists, all changed due to age. But not only the actors and their incredible abilities (additional claps to Millie Bobby Brown), but the plot also grew. The resurgence of the villain, the violence of his entity and his followers, as well as the nauseating way of recruiting them, and the level and maturity of the crimes unrolled. In this season we have the development of the old and new characters, the presentation of their positive and negative characteristics, their internal conflicts, external fights, and even some justifications and redemptions for their actions. This year we see more human and political crimes, many influenced by the mystical entity of the inverted world, but still developed by the human side. We find ourselves in the Cold War scene with antagonists interested in the events that occurred in Hawkins, although without so many explanations, which did not degrade the quality of the story. After all, the old Cold War conflict added to a parallel world filled with scientific novelties and secret passages ends up making the purpose a bit too obvious to be so approached.
The series this year also goes faster. There are not too many subframes, everything is well connected. And all the focus are well concentrated without pointing out superfluous details. However, the pace at which we were accustomed to seeing conflicts, and then the various reunions of the young protagonists in amicable and amusing meetings is altered and accelerated, by the very fact of the growth of all. The novel takes the place of some friendships, and some losses open up new spaces for a continued plot in a fourth season or not.
Speaking about entertainment and the market, of course we will see another season of Stranger Things, and that this may not focus so much on the frames that the previous ones have focused on the level of personal interactions and plots to fight not to be repetitive and always be able to say that "" closed with a golden key. "" And speaking about personal desires is clear that many also want a continuation, but I think we can all agree that if for any (impossible) reason the series ends now, satisfaction will be greater than anxiety or disappointment. Even after that post-credit scene."
2140,"It's alright. It keeps you entertained. It done well enough. Has a decent plot. Character development is good. Good direction. This movie though could do without a bunch of foul mouthed kids. I'm sure this is normal kid behavior in a lot of homes, but if there's one thing I can't stand are foul mouthed kids."
2141,"Contains spoilers...I'll get straight to the point, I will not watch season 2. I really really wanted to like this show but NOTHING happens in it. Seems like the writers are building the story up to for what may (or may not) be more interesting in the future but I will not waste any more time on it. Here is a quick review of what happened on season 1: - Kid gets kidnapped by scary creature - Sheriff looks for the kid and believe at some point that a secret organization is hiding him - Some girl has super powers and can contact the creature world (which is a parallel dimension), locate people there, etc'... - Secret organization chasing after girl with super powers, girl smack their asses every time. - Sheriff and missing kid's mom going to other dimension to rescue kid (they succeed) - girl kills creature and disappears with itThis main story could have been made to a lousy one and half/two hour film, instead it stretches on almost eight hours with in-between cliché teenager stories and uninteresting sub plots. 80's ambiance is great with sound track, acting and overall feeling. Plot-wise, The other dimension had no story depth which makes the main story feel shallow, just some brainless killer creature/s from a parallel dimension, a kid getting kidnapped (and get saved eventually) and a girl with telekinetic powers which we learn almost nothing about and why she has those powers."
2142,"Season 3 is definitely no where near as bad as they say it is. Critically, it may be the worst season, but it's definitely the funniest and it's the one that most of my friends love the most. It also, in my opinion, has the warmest feeling to it while watching, even with the heart-breaking ending. Some people even said that Season 2 was bad, whereas in my opinion Season 2 has the most suspense out of all the seasons. This show is amazing and everything about it is good - you will get hooked and love it."
2143,"I think the hype is a little out of hand, probably wouldn't make a list of my top 20 shows. but i found it entertaining.season 1: 5/10
enjoyable for the most part but i was never super excited to see what comes next. never reached maximum velocity. some of the storylines aren't interesting, and there is definitely some stupid stuff you have to ignore. also, it felt very unoriginal. part of the novelty of this show is the kids and their mission. but we've already seen that in super 8 and attack the block. and SOOO many of the cool scenes were things i've previously seen in other movies and shows. decent show but definitely over-hyped (1 viewing)season 2: 7/10
much better and more exciting than season one. very enjoyable with lots of cool scenes and suspenseful moments. much more of a creepy and scary tone. still some issues: somewhat predictable, panders to newbies (explaining things that i had already deduced), and the damn love triangles. blah. (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
the bob death scene was so predictable it made me sad. so many hints leading up to it. some horrible decision making, and then the obvious ""everything is ok"" moment before he gets killed. at one point i thought it was so obvious that they were doing it on purpose to try to fake us out because he actually survives. but nope, exactly what i thought.season 3: 8/10
very exciting and suspenseful throughout. has finally hit it's stride imo. i had a few small issues but nothing too big. one that i will touch on is this... 80s nostalgia is cool, but ""80s movies"" nostalgia is NOT. i feel like a lot of the nostalgia in here was not about the 80s but about 80s movies specifically. 80s movies are terrible. please don't pay homage. (1 viewing)"
2144,"The series is really amusing ,it varies from scary scenes to suspense ,little romantic to an amazing dramatic real life ending that touched our hearts❤,can't wait for S.4!"
2145,"If your a child of the 80's this will have you by the hook! The acting is superb, story telling in simple, honest and engaging.If you haven't watched this already your massively missing out.. entertaining, engaging and fabulous! A must watch!!"
2146,"Season 1 starts the show off very well and it is very strong, season 2 lives up to season 1, and season 3 is even better than the previous two. There is a lot of saltiness in some of the reviews about season 3, and I don't know why, everyone I have talked too agrees that season 3 is better or at least lives up to the previous seasons"
2147,"Amazed when decided to start watch it two weeks ago
I am now in the begining of seasone 3!
Something with the 80's realistic feel, briliant sound track, amazing original music and known hits,
Sets and costumes and above all - story line and actors! So very good mystery/fantasy series."
2148,"There isn't one season which i have not binged, because the writers make sure you are always on edge and wonder what is happening the next episode. Quality oozes from every episode, and i get genuinely nostaligic...and i was born in the 90s. The music is great, the characters are lovable and you care for them.If i could rank the seasons i would definetly rank season 3 though. What a masterpiece! Bringing russians into the mix, (you got to remember, this is the cold war), is one of the smartest things they could have done. The Sovjet union will of course grab every possibility they can get to have the edge, so the plot is realistic, if it had happened.Season 2 is the only thing that is dragging the score though. It was great, don't get me wrong, but it felt disconnected. Eleven went full emo, and everyone was on seperate places. The season still had some of the best action in the series, so it is no doubt worth watching."
2149,"Disclaimer: As stated in the title this is a spoiler free review of Stranger Things Season 3 but I will be talking about plot points and minor spoilers from Season 1 & 2.So Stranger Things 3 picks up where we left off after season 2, everyone is happy and everyone is together, there is love in the air, it is the summer of love. Right off the bat I can say I preferred this season over season 2. This season felt more contained, it felt like it had a purpose and knew what it was doing and where is was going. Season 2 for me felt more of a mess, especially with ""The Lost Sister"" filler episode. The reviews of that episode tanked so hard that the writers completely gave up on that subplot, and I'm glad they did. That is one of the many reasons season 3 feels so much more crisp, because Matt and Ross Duffer decided to be more focused on the main story.
As always the cast this season is great, the kids are now older and feel more like seasoned actors and much more mature in their performances. The kids stand out and shine more in this season especially with the addition of a couple of new characters. The adult characters are great as well, but a lot of them (apart from the main ones) felt wasted and underdeveloped. For example, in true 1980's form, we have evil Russians, which sounds hilarious but falls flat. The reason season 1 shined more than this or season 2 is because it had a well defined shadowy government department with a leader who was well developed. Remember ""papa"" from season 1? aka Dr. Martin Brenner. He was a menacing villain who had purpose and reasons for his experimentations on children and trying to open a gateway to the upside down. Plus we had the Demogorgon, which became a huge costume choice during halloween that year. It's cute that the kids in season 1 called the beast ""Demogorgon"" and in season 2 started calling the bigger beast ""Mind Flayer"" because that is their only visual reference they can give it, being fans of Dungeons and Dragons they named those beasts after creatures in D&D.
But here in season 3 we have evil Russians being bad for the sake of the 1980's stereotype. This is my one and only problem with this season, a lack of a villain with a purpose. But all that doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things in the season with the ""Mind Flayer"" being back. Season 3 definitely improves its writing and storytelling from season 2, even if we put aside evil Russians we still have the introduction of a very well developed Russian scientist. I won't give anymore details about him to keep this spoiler free.
Let's go to the mall, and what a mall it is. Starcourt mall is by far one of the best sets, art direction, production design, props, lighting, costumes, extras that I have seen in a series. It is amazing, literally the highlight of the season. They made it feel so authentically 1980's America, licensing dozens of brands to further elevate the authenticity. They didn't just build a set on a sound stage, they found an abandoned mall and built the inside from the ground up, innards, lighting, fixtures, branding, shops etc. They made it a fully functioning mall. That level of detail makes the mall so much more immersive for the viewers and probably for the actors in the scenes as well. For me, the mall was the scene stealer more than anything else. Each character/group goes on their own adventure and purpose to complete a task or uncover some information. There are a few really good plot points and twists and interesting new characters and old recurring characters throughout the season and it felt so wholesome. The second half of the season is much stronger and even got me quite emotional.
Rating: I'm giving Stranger Things Season 3 an 8.5 out of 10.
After 3 seasons this show doesn't just feel like a one hit wonder, although with a slightly rocky second season, season 3 comes back to form and delivers a satisfying narrative reminiscent of season 1. Even without a purposeful/menacing human villain this season still goes strong with tons of 80's nostalgia and easter eggs. If you have seen season 1 & 2 you will want to see this season as it is not a disappointment. Lucas's younger sister Erica, is another scene stealer along with the Russian scientist Alexei. Keep an eye out for those characters as you watch the season."
2150,"The 80's setting is brillant. Everyone who loves films from this era will feel like ""aaaww, look how good they bring the 80s back to life!""
The actos are fine and you will soon begin to like them, especially the teenagers. Their adventures remind a bit of ""Stand by me"" from Stephen King, things like friendship and solidarity are very important and play a big role.
Everything fits perfect together in this show, it's not too long-winded but still enough to show the good and bad sides of the characters and their development through the episodes. The mystery and horror elements bring a litte bit of darkness and the right portion of suspense to the story.
In my opinion, well done."
2151,"It will be more interesting... Anyhow seems it will not bored me, if i watch it again"
2152,"For so long the way they write horror stories had changed this captures something that classic 80s horror used to be. This copies and combines so many movies mosters in a good way and even had an invaders of the body snachers type of story and still worked because the cast and story worked well. Thier were lots of greatness but some repitition of eleven using her powers but overall still good to watch. The ending cut scene was a good ending teaser for season 4.
where have i seen the main monster before? It was like the monster in stephen kings dreamcatcher and BEHEMOTH from (THE MIST) combined with other references include the monsters in resident evil, tremors,and the blob 1980s."
2153,The perfect action packed comedy on television. You will enjoy this show every time you watch it.Spooky & Retro
2154,As the show continues to throw unexpected twists and turns i find myself stuck on one thing trying to figure out what happened. There a lot of electric moments where there's lights flickering and beams of lights in the dark. There is a whole other world where if blood is in the real world then this monster comes out and begins attacking.Then the girl that looks like a boy is getting hunted down by her father because he know that she has super powers.The biggest part of the story line is to figure out where will is. Will is in another word and he can communicate in lights and other ways. There is a moment in the show where some people say it was will that got pulled out of the water but his friends knew that it wasn't him.
2155,"This is not just a show it has my feeling, its just amazing and my favorite show. I want to stuck with this show and the characters i just loves this show 3000"
2156,"Thoroughly entertaining edge of the seat entertainment. I didn't think that they could better season 2 but I was wrong. From the first episode you just keep wanting more. Only one Goof I found, they show v the kids going into the cinema with Back to the Future showing, but that film wad not released until December 1985 and the episode is set on 4th of July! Can't wait for season 4"
2157,"Arranger Things is really really a great series. The actors have this special Thing, that just make u wanna watch What happens to Them Next. The story is solid, and builds up as it goes. Everything is shoot perfect.,,, could i give this series 11 Stars i would."
2158,The best serial in the world me and my other friends really love that
2159,"Amazing show, but i somehow crave for a cold Coca-Cola whenever i watch it"
2160,"Just watch it and you will know what I mean
It is officially the best Netflix series....With an amazing set of characters with a great sense of humor !!"
2161,"An absolutely outstanding series that send to know exactly what it is. It's Goonies meets Halloween meets Ghostbusters. A fun filled nostalgia fest that doesn't take itself seriously but delivers more than most Hollywood blockbusters ever could.
The kids are the stars here. Brilliant talents and you genuinely believe them. Eleven is the standout without question with Dustin a close second.
Ignore criticism of this and just watch it for fun. Duffers; take a bow. You deserve it!"
2162,"This show lost 2 points because of Wynona Ryder. I enjoyed the little story, but was annoyed with every WR scene. one of the most absolutely disgusting acting jobs I have seen in years. This could have been a 12 year old girl from a middle school play. The story itself, although done before was riveting, and kept my attention and I liked the ending. That said, I will not be watching season 2 , with another dreadful season of WR."
2163,I really loved Season 3 ! It's the best so far ! I loved it ! Great story ! Great actors ! Great Mood !
2164,"I'm gonna talk about the last episode.
I cried a lot of that speech. It hit me so hard. It felt like that at the same time everything is against you and and trying to find something to fight for. I know it's a hard life trying your best and when you are doing that you will fail."
2165,"I love this series so much that I didnt want it to end. I love the characters and how genuinely they acted surreal. Nostalgic as well, truly miss the old days where people enjoy their life never about work. Truly a stellar show."
2166,"Everything is great Story, actors Especially Millie b. Brown 🐰"
2167,I feel insane whenever i watch this show. This is the best tv show after GOT for me.. Season 3 just nailed it!
2168,"Roles really well performed, amazing story telling,and a good ""time machine"". It reminds me the old times.This series is amazing. You really have to watch thia"
2169,"The wait has been worth the wait, series takes off from where it left us in season 2 and spins an entertaining new story with a emotional ending.Season 3 is as gripping as previous 2 season which meant I ended up binge watching season 3 in just a day.Hopefully they won't lose the plot if there is a season 4.Ps: Don't skip the credits end of episode 8 or else you will miss the prelude to season 4"
2170,"<3
it had too bed end
<3i love stranger things <3<3i love stranger things <3"
2171,"3rd season is awesome, funny, sad and gross at the same time.
if u loved Steve in previous season..you will love him even more in this one.
aand there are some new characters that u will definitely like.ohh the nostalgia."
2172,"Season one was awesome and absolute adaptation of E.T and X-Files ,It and some classic stuff.Season 2 was exciting and ok.but season 3 was so so brilliant.and has remained me terminator, The Thing and some classic references.Just don't judge the show and watch it .even a second I didn't get bored.and mind-blowing.some r saying comedy is ruined but I say it's a correction of season 2 which is dark and get bored sometimes.but this season comedy has really worked really well.yes there are some comedy that didn't workout in episode but it's not a mistake.actually well returned well structured writing ,CG work just out of the world,artwork cinematography was awesome, background score really so good as usual.I would say it's only series which is re-watchable again and again.please make season 4 as well like this."
2173,"This mini-series has a lot of buzz before it's release. While I was seeing Marco Polo (pretty good series) saw the trailer and remember saying ""Looks like a good suspense-science-fiction mini series, I need to see this one"".Then I started. I fell into the trap.The issue here is that this is made for 10-15 years boys. It's a more than amazing show for that range. But there is no a direct message in the trailer implying this. In one of the first episodes, there is a scene of a dead person in the cafeteria with a bullet in his head, lying there, really explicit...if you know what I mean. This is really misleading. For a moment, I thought I was seeing a serious show with ""magic"" touches thanks to the kids and their story. How wrong I was.The number of scenes when any character made a stupid decision or movement, is countless. For example, the van flying in the air, falling in front of the 3 other government's vans in the pursuit: in serious story, they would have just passed through the vehicle's side and continue pursuing the kids that were ON BICYCLES!But not in this show. 10-15 years boys won't question that logic. So they don't have to take care of those details. All of those grownup who made it trhough the 7° episode, will anyhow finish the series anyway, so screw them.This is seriously, a trap for people over 18 years old.Be aware."
2174,For me personally it's the best of the best. Probably because i'm a big fan of the horror genre.
2175,"Every season gets better and better..
the cast is amazing and writing is unbelievable."
2176,I binge watched all 3 seasons each time they came out and will prob watch them all again. Its is the best netflix show period.
2177,"When I first started watching this show, I didn't think too much of it, not my type. But now after watching all three seasons, I am honestly mindblown. This writing is genius and how they're able to make the audience have so many emotions in just the timerun of just a few minutes amazes me. When I first heard the main cast was gonna be kids, I wasn't really interested, since I thought they'd have to make the 'romance' and the monsters too not be too much and that they'd end up with a mildly scary disney channel show, but it is far from that at all. Beautifully excecuted. One of, if not my favourite show right now."
2178,"Stranger things .... Whoa , the best ever series that I have been through in the SCI FI +thriller genre.This isn't just a series it's master piece from the duffer brothers .The story goes through 4best friends who lives in Hawkins,indiana in the 1986,and things changes when a 10 year old girl named eleven comes into their lives.The casting was the most important aspect of ST's success,Milly Bobby Brown,Finn wolfhard,Noah snapps, Gaten matterazo,Caleb McLaughlin,David harbour and Winona Ryder were amazing on their roles, in season 3 the most wonderful was the hopper-joyce combo which touched all hearts .Even though the ending made me cry a lot ,I'm hoping that the 'american' is hopper.the Russian thug Andrey ivchenko reassemble the Arnold shawznager.😅😅"
2179,"I am not a huge fan of science fiction, but I like this show. I am especially happy to see Winona Rider acting again. Fun, interesting, and a plot that keeps it's twists and turns going. The makers seem to have gone out of their way to find people who don't look like Hollywood. The kids are pretty good actors, too. Due to a few somewhat scary scenes, and kids using guns,I'd not recommend this for children under 10 or 11. I'm giving it a five for one reason and one reason only. The sound is so out of control I'm entirely annoyed by it. The sound on my remote goes from 1 to 100. At times, to hear the dialog, I have had to push it up to 96. Then when the music comes on, I find myself pushing it down to 75 or just turning on the mute button. Aggravating to say the least and really takes away from my enjoyment of the show. If it weren't for this, I'd being give it an 8."
2180,"First of all comparing this show to other Netflix original shows this one is amazing! Everything about this show is incredible, the plot, the actors... and so much more. The show takes place in 1983-1985 which adds a lot to the series. I 100% recommenced to watch this show!!"
2181,Season 1 and 2 were fantastic just watched Swanson three and omg wtf it's so good a great addition to the series and pretty sure a 4 season will be happening and at the end of three billy and hopper died
2182,I downloaded and there I can not use it please someone help. Thank you in advance.
2183,"I like this serial, must be in top 10 in the world"
2184,"Overall, I liked the first season and then I found the plot repetitive, yet amusing since the idea in itself is original and it doesn't resemble to another TV show. My only problem is the future of the TV show. How are they going to create new dimensions to the characters, new surprises, etc..."
2185,"When creativity is lacking... I feel like the only appeal of this show was an escape to a simpler time, it's fueled by how polarized and ugly our current year is coupled with a huge amount of meh content and a severe lack of good entertainment... like a boxing champ that benefited from weak competition this show is not as good as people make out."
2186,"Season 1 was decent, thought it was trying to deviate from other sci-fi movies, games or tv series but by the end of season 2, it totally feels a rip off of core idea of Half-Life game series, copies of cliche dialogues from movies such as Insidious, copy of setup from movies such as Donny Darko and I can go on and on. Despite it being a rip off of many, it still is an entertaining series."
2187,"This summer, my sister watched this movie. I liked him very much, it was very interesting. In general, I really like to watch TV shows and films, but it was this film that sank into my soul most of all. I used to watch the first and second season, But I didn't really like it. But it was in this season that I just fell in love. It was scary in some places, interesting and intriguing in places. I really look forward to the fourth season, I hope that it will be more interesting than the third. I want ODI to come back to this adventure place.Please, I am very waiting new season!!"
2188,"Must see series! Recommend to literally anyone, especially those who love the 80s!"
2189,When i started watching this show i thought it's just a kid television but after 2 or 3 episode i actually like this all of character. all those character are good Millie Bobby Brown she doing amazing work. i like this show.
2190,"Pretty great series, some parts were a drag but the overall storyline was great, it had suspense, thriller, drama, comedy & action!"
2191,"The script, the story, the characters; everything in this show is great. If you haven't seen it yet, you are seriously missing out."
2192,"This thriller series contains all the horror, comedy, tragedy, action, adventure which on can not find in any tv series."
2193,"This show is a great show for pre teens and teens. I loved the show, it was just the language that I did not like. A story of friendship and what's out there, Stranger Things is a great show to watch."
2194,"Since its premiere, ""Stranger Things"" have been one of the most successful shows on Netflix. And I have to admit that it's a little bit overrated. Don't get me wrong. ""Stranger Things"" is a good show even if you don't let yourself be caught up by the nostalgia. But that's it. A excellent show that relies frequently on Nostalgia.The first season is almost a masterpiece and probably if it were a limited series, it will be one of the most amazing shows in the world. The story is simple and full of mysteries that you want to discover. The characters are all interesting and they play an significant role for the plot and the development of this. The chemistry between the characters is good and the kids shine for being so excellent actors with such a good roles.But season two is so mediocre. Most of the characters feel like they are there just because they were in the first season. For example, Nancy and Jonathan are there for the sake of being there and finally solve their obvious romance. Mike, who was the leading character in the first season, here is so annoying. The story is simple and it becomes great in the last 3 episodes (If you forget that 2x06 exists. That episode is so filler is never brought up again.).Season 3 is so considerably better than season 2. The new characters are appealing and the use of the new characters from S2 is so much better. It feels as good as the first season with a story that it's not about mysteries anymore but about the fight of goods against monsters and corrupt government. The romance is also a focus of this show and it's moderately good. Mike is still annoying but Eleven is the real leading character of the kids plot.""Stranger Things"" is a very good and popular show. It's a delightful surprise that it's going to end in the next season (4 Seasons) but it's the ideal choice for this show to end while remains good."
2195,Great series paying homage to the 80s! It really is like the goonies meets monster squad meets x-files. Looking forward to season 4 hopefully they end it with season 5 or a film or even both as I think it will hold the quality if it doesn't over stay its welcome. Other shows need to take note!
2196,On of the best series i 've ever seen the young actors is very good
2197,"I was 10 in 1980, which makes me very happy to say, because now I'm almost 50 and still can feel the emotions when I watch E.T. or Empire Strikes back, or Polterguist. I could give a crap about the accolades that Netfix receives. I wanted to write a comment because how much I loved the first season. Teenagers, mystery, explorer's, the imagination of kids back then were not left to devises and video games (sure I had Nintendo) but being young and having D&D parties with domino's pizza breath and braces. Adventure of the mind and a good bicycle. The kids in this show are excellent actors. Ryder and Harbour are good at making it feel as real for adults, and sadness with tears of joy and heartache. All around an excellent show. I'm gearing up for Halloween on Thursday with season two. Oh the girl, Millie Bobby Brown, my God is she a powerhouse of little words, and screams that give me the chills. Scary show at times, and funny. Great cast. Great tv."
2198,It's definitely worth watching webseries but i think it's not that good what everyone is talking about it's just a simple story with one ugly monster but yeah worth watching ..
2199,"PROS:-So, the best part about this series is that it very cleverly introduces us to the main characters and even a little foreshadowing and we are immediately invested into the story and you can literally have favourite characters from the first episode itself.So, the main premise is that this kid named will suddenly disappears and his friends are worried about him and stumble across this girl(eleven) who has just recently escaped from the hawkins labaratory and they suspect that this could be connected to will's sudden disappearance and so these kids embark on an amazing journey to find will and also the adults in this series also try to find will but they're pretty slow compared to the kids.the crossing of the storylines is done flawlessly which is also very great about this series.eleven's powers and her relationship with mike is also very well handled and doesn't steal much of the screentime like it should, because this isnt a love storythe main thing that made me fall in love with this series is the very clever ways that the characters in the show come up with.CONS:-my problem with the show will be season 2, more specifically how they separated a character, which was imo not very great, while some people liked it.another HUGE PROBLEM WILL BE S2E7. Now if you've watched the show, why are you even seeing reviews. But the main thing is they show the character that was separated and focus the entire episode on that character and after the episode ends the character is reunited in the next episode, so I may even suggest you to skip this episode because as far as i remember there are no other main characters in that episode so it's literally a waste of time.So yeah that's all i've got to say for stranger things a pretty exciting show tbh and i would give it the rating of 10/10 if season 2 didnt mess it up, so my final rating will be 8/10 which is still pretty decent and why you should definitely watch this amazing master piece, and if you really want to watch this for nostalgia there are literally a lot of tv shows and movies but really i like it more for the plot and it's totally on you to watch it for nostalgia, I didnt watch it for nostalgia because of two reasons, I'm not american so it doesnt relate to me, and also because i wasnt born in the eighty's but still its a show for all to watch."
2200,Stranger things all episode great and Millie Bobby Brown acting excellent I am waiting stranger things season 4 😍😍😍😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍😍 😍
2201,"A walk in shoes of a mum lost her kid and frends go looking for him.
A girl el pops upIn end you find the up side down world with creatures of hg wells time machineAnd a government body trying hide stuff"
2202,"Watched this for the second time and can't get enough of it. The music, the actors and very well done. Emotional, funny, very exciting and sometimes scary too ;) a mix of everything. If you haven't seen Stranger Things yet then you must see all seasons, you have missed something really good! Love it"
2203,Brilliant TV series. Had me hooked after few episodes of Season 1. Season 3 was fantastic and they really step up the budget (spend more $$ on the sets). Not sure were Season 4 is going but I hope they keep up the good work.
2204,"Stranger ThingsBeautiful, and well crafted. Stranger Things earns its spot for this golden age of television by delivering a beautiful send up to Stephen King and Steven Spielberg with great writing and beautiful performances from Millie Bobby Brown and Winona Ryder.Stranger Things 2Slow but eerie, season 2 delivers with great turns from Noah Schnapp and David Harbour, as well as the continued character development and the addition of Sean Astin, Sadie Sink, and Dacre Montgomery the threats are greater and the suspense continues to build! Despite the 7th episode which left an odd blemish on an otherwise flawless season.Stranger Things 3Though some might find the tonal switch off putting, the third season gives us a colorful and creepy continuation to the series all while keeping that Stranger Things feel. The cast and characters continually shine and the end will leave you in tears. Another great addition to this phenomenal series."
2205,"This show is drop dead amazing. this will be forever be my favorite show and i will make my kids watch it. the actors do such an amazing job. the directors and writers produced this so well. if you have netflix, go watch it now. i have watched it 17 times through and on my 18th."
2206,"A sensational series that pays tribute to the 80's and mixes horror with magic.
The actors are at the height. The soundtracks and the special effects teleport us into this scary, stressful and mysterious world.The supernatural intrigues us and darkness attracts us.
Clichés in the 80s are numerous, E.T, the Goonies, XFiles or Steven Spielberg's Alien.The references to Stephen King are also present. The performance of the children and particularly that of Millie Bobby Brown / Eleven is breathtaking. In conclusion, the Duffer brothers did a really good job!I'm looking forward to the next season!"
2207,"The comedy, horror and drama is so balanced and the series are very interesting, in my opinion, all seasons are great, including season 3 which is disliked for no reason."
2208,"Stranger things is a show amazing that is filled with suspens, monster. This is a very good show for adults and children. It is at once a show of adventure, drama, thriller, romance, horror ... The main actors are mostly children and teenagers, that's one of the reasons i like this show. In addition, the actors play very well. It's a show to watch, not to be missed."
2209,"One of the best series I have watched, till now... It is such series that every person can watch from Childers to elders, it has all the elements that a series should have horror, romantic, true friendship, hate etc. And as u start watching the curiosity goes on high, what will happen in next episode
Wating for season 4"
2210,"Never been hooked more to a series than this, freaking cool monsters, cute couples, funny af. Man love this show but kinda hate S3 ending especialy that el and Will move away.. And Hopper well.. who knows what happens to him..."
2211,Even though I was not born in the 80's. I still do find this series to pay a perfect pitch homage to that era. It just about covers the 80's in a perfect sense for most people. Netflix has down a great job. When a movie company steps back and allows the room needed to be able to pull this off you get a great product. Double thumbs up!
2212,"Stranger things was the best tv show for me. Emotions, ansiety, fear, laughs, plots chasing each other. Thank you dufferbrothers for this masterpiece"
2213,"The best part of Stranger Things is that there is something there for everyone. Do you want that 80's nostalgia the show is known for? Do you want a bit of romance? Do you want drama? Do you want a binge worthy show with some awesome, well rounded, relatable characters? Some action? What about comedy? Do you want some horror sprinkled in there? Or are you more into the psychological/thriller/conspiracy theory stuff? Well, good news for you buddy! This show's got it all, and it uses every aspect of its phenomenal writing to create an all around awesome viewing experience you are not soon to forget. What makes Stranger Things so great? Really, it's not one big thing. The story is already pretty good; kid goes missing in a small town and the people soon realize there's a whole lot more to it than just a disappearance. Then this plot is expanded beautifully with several different story arcs going at the same time. Other shows sometimes have difficulty balancing different points of view, but Stranger Things feel very well balanced, and as though you see all of the characters for the same amount of time. And don't even get me started on the characters! I won't say much here, but everyone is very well rounded, coming off as people and not some characters a writer scrapped together in order to keep the plot flowing.
And that's just season 1!
Season 2 is a bit slower than its predecessor, but in the end all of that build up feels worth it for the climax, so don't worry about that at all.
Finally, as a small warning, (but not a spoiler, don't panic) season 3 is significantly more graphic and scarier than the first two. Just a warning if you're watching with kids, but all of that information should be in the parental guide. It seems people got a little annoyed, because season 3 is very reminiscent of a horror movie, but honestly, it works pretty well for Stranger Things.
Anyways, it's a great show and if you're hoping to watch it, you absolutely should. All I'm going to say is that it is absolutely worth it in every aspect. Have fun!"
2214,A good show with some great young actors/actresses.
2215,"I've been watching this show since it came out, and I love it! Seasons 1 & 2 were phenomenal, by season 3... I absolutely loved season 3, and it's my favourite by far!So you can imagine my shock when people say season 3 is ""horrible"" and ""ruined the series"". I don't get it... it was full of action, drama, and fun.But anyways, if you haven't seen it yet...what are you doing! Go watch, cause believe me you won't be disappointed!"
2216,"Netflix did an amazing job with this series. It starts off as a classic 80's themed show but turns into something unimaginable. It takes a dark twist on the world and gives us an idea of another demented reality. Besides all of the dark and twisted things that go down, it displays a great sense of friendship through all the children coming together, to help one another through their darkest times. I highly recommend watching this show, you will not regret it."
2217,"I'll say this without any doubts that Stranger Things is one of the best TV shows I've seen in recent times. I've been a fan of Stranger Things since the second season first came out and I just got one word for it: AMAZING.
Stranger Things is one of the best shows I have ever seen .."
2218,I'm not giving spoilers. Just came here to say that the best season of this series was the season 2 because has Bob. He's everything a hero needs to be.
2219,"Combination of an interesting central concept, the upside down, with perfectly executed nostalgia and music. Really liked the characters. While season 3 is probably not as good as the others it's still excellent.
Certainly in the top 10 tv series of recent times."
2220,I went back to my childhood reading of science fiction and after a long time a very cool thing that reminds me of my childhood. I really appreciate how they build the story and everything of the series.
2221,The best sc fiction serie I have ever seen in my life
2222,"When I heard about this show coming up, I was very interested in it. I enjoy horror, mysteries, and the '80s. And ultimately, I was very impressed with the first season. The second season was also good as well as the third, but I can't help but think the show should've probably ended after one season. Or at least tell a different story in the next ones. Even with that in mind, I think this is a great show. The acting is really good, especially from the kids, the story is interesting and kinda messed up, the characters are all very likable, the action is great, the tone fits very well, it has a lot of really good camera work, and it even has some good humor.Overall, 8.6/10 (Great)"
2223,This show have unique difference kind of 1980's sci-fi series. This show all actor and actress performance are too good. This my 2th best series i ever seen.
2224,"Season 4 Will Be On Fire. Don't Think Jim Is Dead, Hopper Is Alive, Because Russian Said Not The American, He's The American In Russian Cell. BOOM"
2225,"Of limits,
Of rapid, abused growth into virgin land,
Of hasty advancements in life and time,
And of some doors that must never be opened,
Through the eyes of a 1980s retrophile,Stranger Things is a brilliantly crafted masterpiece of a dwindling genre of gripping science fiction, set in the times when they were at their prime.It is a tale of childhood, of parenthood and of nostalgia told amidst the impending doom of the Upside Down.Love comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and manifests between human beings of all ages.Be it the innocent longing between children,
Or the fiesty and volatile high school romance of adolescents Or a healing love and support between the middle aged, to whom life has been unkind,And so, Stranger Things is a celebration of the majesty and variety of Love.A blast from the past.The series reminds us of a time when most of us weren't even born.A time when culture was rich and unique.
A time when culture was still - guys with long hair, and thigh high shorts
A time when cycles as getaway vehicles were still in the vogue
A time when the opening of malls still to be a thing of wonder
A time when children still had the time to visit amusement arcades
And a time when walkie-talkies, and not cellphone, still used to bridge distances.A super mother.
A chubby home-town chief who has the greatest heart.
An assortment of the nerdiest, most intelligent chipmunks in town.
A highschool hotshot, a weirdo and a miss goody-two-shoes.
A bad scientist. A good scientist. A secret scientist.
The Russians.And dogs that will make you shit in your pants...Strangers Things has it all in this unbelievably believable, irrelevantly relevant, heart warming tale of great beauty."
2226,"Best series I have ever watched! so unique and well thought out. this could be real! just think about it, 80's show with 21st century graphics #bomb"
2227,"Fireworks going off in the back ground. The kids are at chief Hoppers Cabin when Nancy gets up and she says ""do you guys hear that"" Lucas says that ""it's just The fireworks"" Nancy then turns around says ""Billie he knows we are here"" I think that she met to say Eleven or a Miss take"
2228,Incredible series... wonderfully scripted. Casting is spot on.. plenty of twists and very addicted series.TAKE A BOW PRODUCTION AND CAST!
2229,One of the best tv-series ever the first season was great and the second was beautiful and the therd was wonderful
2230,"And one more time Netflix bring to us a new excelent season of Stranger Things. The nice story continues interresting in this third season: a lot of character dinamics are developed and upgraded, new carismática character, a classic and still very well made 80's atmosphere and a threat interresting and captivating. The story is simples, but really well made and memorable, for sure stranger things is one of the best series today!"
2231,"I have been watching Stranger Things for four days straight. I finished the series in three of those four days. Now I am just doing reruns so here is my review for my first time viewing.Season 1: My god! I thought I was going to like this show but I loved it! Season 1 kept me on my seat through it all and it got me wanting to learn more about Eleven's past! Definitely recommend everyone to watch Season 1 if they haven't already!Season 2: That season was also very fantastic because you get to see character development in everyone and Mike becomes a little more inviting when Max shows that she can help with their problems in Hawkins. Mike learning that Eleven was there all along and Finn Wolfhard's delivery in how upset Mike was with Hopper for keeping Eleven hidden for 353 days was 10/10 performance on his part! Kudos to you Mr. Wolfhard.Season 3: Despite a lot of hate that season got, I rather loved it because of the romantic drama that ensued in the season premiere with Hopper coercing Mike to become distant with Eleven, causing her to dump him was nothing short of genius! It made me sit on the edge of my seat wondering if Mike and Eleven would ever get back together. I personally cannot wait for Season 4!I love this show so much and I have many of my friends to thank for saying nothing but good things about the show before I started watching it. It's because of them is why I am so invested in the show!"
2232,"Great from start to finish. Season one begins the upsidedown and Eleven story, and all the others continue to bring in new characters and follow the story."

2234,"It is worth it, but little bit of cliché. First season is clasic. Second season is as good as the first one. And the third season is the best of them. You must atleast try it."
2235,Don't let logic get in the way of a great story. Just enjoy.
2236,I wasn't the person to watch hollywood series so often. But this series makes me excited to watch.
2237,Really loved the last episode of S3 it's was filled with action and so much emotion
2238,"Stranger Things is widely loved by audiences of almost all ages, and for good reason. It's got enough 80s filming style and memorabilia for those who grew up during the 80s to feel nostalgic, while also still being modern enough to appeal to the younger audience as well. The acting and storylines are mostly pretty great and manages to find a comfort zone between delivering comedy and horror/suspense. I'm a 30 year old male and I'm a big fan of this show and if you haven't at least tried to watch it yet, give it a go and I'm willing to bet you'll find something about it you enjoy as well"
2239,"It truly feels like the 80s: Great music, acting, writing, etc! Lots of heart. Combines sci-fi, action, drama, comedy, horror, and romance! All in one.Only reason it's not 10/10 is the stupid LGBT agenda in season 3. Yeah spoiler alert they screw up a sub plot with some bs agenda. F them."
2240,"Growing up in the 80's when this series takes place, brings back memories of my childhood friends and our antics. Obviously my experiences were nothing like the ST gang! Great writing and great acting from these kids! Exciting adventures! Give it a watch for sure!"
2241,"I loved the 80's setting with evil Russians, classic rock music (the series' OST is awesome), D&D, monsters and mythos inspired by Lovecraft, King and Carpenter.
The first season is 10/10 and honestly the series should've ended on season one. The following two seasons often felt rushed and too banal.
The young actors are very talented, which is rare among kids actors, and play believable and complex characters.
A must watch for any 80's horror movie fan."
2242,"Blablablablabalba ablab
Blab blab blab blab bla
It's toooo good I love it
I love Mille bobby brown"
2243,"Wait don't be misled by the series cover picture if you think this is a child show you are RIGHT. But it's definitely worth watching by every age category.
Great 80s theme with outstanding young actors turn to be a great character on the show as a party living in Indiana, Hawkins nerds genius little minds trying to save the earth from the other dimension monsters after they get to know a new freak friend who has a super power called El (11, eleven) whom she is running from government experimental labs and the life of this show takes you to a new level of mystery, adventure, romantic, horrifying story you will never forget by its cutting breathtaking shots."
2244,"What started of as just a casual watch, became part of my life forever.
The characters from Jim to Dustin to Will to El, they all became chapter in life in no time.
Its a must watch, addictive to another level.
Kudos!"
2245,This story is very intresting and i hope they add season 4 any time soon
2246,"This series is all the things you could possibly want in a series. It has humor, romance,drama and scary stuff. The actors are some of the best and an amazing script."
2247,"Why do you always spoil this kind of series when they see children like the old exchange of kisses are only 12 years old? How to add to the scenes kisses among them how to allow this I think this is annoying to me but I also think that many agree with me on this point.But we must do justice to this series of the most beautiful serials I liked it that they were keen on the series decoration and photography is very beautiful and tell the story as well, and yes this series is among the top 10 series I have."
2248,"The Duffer brothers are absolutely BRILLIANT I loved every bit of it I love how they add comedy, action, adventure and frightening. I can't put down into words how good it was . The Duffer brothers add a sense of unknowing which is a really good thing to have when writing a show . I can't wait for season 4 it's a shame i have to wait a year ."
2249,The series is excellent but OMG are there slow and tedious tangents in season two. The could cut out an episode or two if they kept the story on point.
2250,"Love it !
Every season has been watched within a few day.
Fantastic show"
2251,"One of the best series i have ever seen in my life the first and second season you might see them so lame but just wait to season 3
(Of course you should see season 1 and 2 to understand the the goal of this series daa )
But be warned the last episode of season 3 gone make you cry this happens to me i one of people that cry once or twice a year"
2252,"So much hate for season 3. I personally liked it. It was definitely not as strong as the first 2, but it was just a different direction. I didn't really think the plot was that bad. There was a bit too much repetitive action sequences, but other than that I felt pretty hooked. Maybe all it takes to appreciate it is to NOT have high expectations and read others' reviews."
2253,"At first it didn't really get me but as I proceed in watching the series, I fell for the characters. They are really well shaped and have a good storyline. I like the idea behind it and how it was imagined."
2254,"I absolutely love Stranger Things (but who doesn't?).I've read through the reviews like a nerd and a lot of slam went to the episode in season 2 on sister time. I actually liked this idea and wish the Duffer Bros would have carried her into season 3. Maybe we can hope to see her come back as ""good"" in the finale.Just throwing a random thought out there. Oh and if you don't like this show - what's wrong with you?"
2255,"If you are doubting watching this, please do yourself a favor and watch it! The suspense, drama, romance, supernatural, and comedy is such a perfect mix for this gem. It is fun to see the character development and really great acting. Honestly, this is such a masterpiece!!"
2256,"This series is so good! The storyline, the cast, the effects, even the period that they are doing this on! I love the 80's I grew up in the 80's! Please check this show out!"
2257,"Love love love season 3, maybe even more than season 1/2. Love the way the Duffer brothers produce the episodes. Storyline is far fetched but who cares it's pure entertainment."
2258,"Stranger Things mixes world-building, relatable characters, masterful directing, and nostalgia to bring a creative and overall fantastic new series."
2259,Season one was good...two was pretty meh. My expectations were low for season three - but they really delivered. It may have even been better than the first.
2260,"Here's my review of Stranger Things season 3. It's summer in Hawkins and it's been a while since the events of season 2 happened. The kids have all grown up , but look the same until you see montages from the previous seasons. Remember when we all thought Avengers Endgame was going to be dark and brooding ? but unlike infinity war it turned out to be a fun heist movie depsite the high stakes involved , that's exactly what this season is too. First of all the production quality is just amazing in this season , especially the set of starcourt mall . As for the characters , they're loveable as always , new additions like Lucas' sister and Robin were great ! Just like in Scooby Doo and the previous seasons of Stranger things , different groups follow different breadcrumbs which are all part of the same loaf. But unlike the previous seasons , this season has an unlikely alliance , like Steve , Dustin , Lucas' sister and Robin , they had the best chemistry compared to the rest of the gang. I also liked Hoppers character this season than from earlier . The only gripes I had with this season was the friendship between Eleven and Max , that didn't work for me at all and also till the fourth episode , I felt the stakes didn't feel high compared to the first two seasons , like for some reason you just know that the person in danger is going to get rescued. But those are just minor nitpicks and personally I thought this season of stranger things was amazing as always and had better phasing than season 2. In the end season 3 is fun , it's vibrant , has a lot of cry worthy emotion , brilliant acting , 80s nostalgia , 80s pop culture and has pg13 Stephen king at its best ."
2261,Great show! Amazing plot i just didn't like the lost sister episode
2262,"Season 3 exceeded my expectations. It pays homage to Aliens, Terminator and The Shining, just to name a few. Packed with action, the ending was phenomenal. The best summer thrill so far !"
2263,"I cried, laughed, scared and had a smile throughout the series. Best time spend with the series. Get us season 4 already."
2264,"The show is very entertaining! Love the effects! Love how they made it look like it was filmed in the 80's !!! Brings me back to my childhood!
I just hope they don't cancel it, like they do with all good shows..."
2265,"I have found a lot of Netflix originals to be fun and interesting. When I heard about Stranger Things shortly after the first season came out, I thought there might be too much ""hype"" and that the show couldn't be THAT good. Boy I was wrong...This series will take you for a ride. Within just the first couple of episodes you feel apart of the story and adventure. Expect a sci-fi element that is surprisingly not cheesy but in fact very intriguing. It will also leave you with many questions; some that will be answered as you go, other's that are left open to your own interpretation. So many things pull together by the end of each season that will make you beg for more. Additionally, with the story taking place in the 80's, meaning there is so much nostalgia!Amazing story line, excellent cast, superior soundtrack...It is a series that won't steer you wrong!"
2266,"Stranger Things is one the Best reviewed sci-fi, Netflix original series, that had ever been made on Netflix. It has all the fun, the action, the drama, the scary images, the thrills, and more shocking twist you'll ever see on Television. This is why you'll love Stranger Things, because, Things will go Stranger everyday :)"
2267,"Stranger Things 1 / 2 / 3 - WOW just WOW
Phenomenal"
2268,"Oh Look its the Big Bad ******** What other nationality could it be after the North Americans esp. in the 80's? A muscle head lead of them stereotyped to look act like one of biggest action stars of era, far further.. The rest of the villains are cartoon like Austin Powers,their set around them as well!One 'Scooby' Doo gang' is superior to other, 100 percent more entertaining. The monster is scary creation. 11' is barely in show, frankly aren't we bored with her. (Actor portray her grossly overpaid and overrated) Nice to see other actors shine in roles with more screen time. The cop is just over the top, behaviourism alarming to everyone esp. females. No one should think of him as heroism!It's a ""red code red code red code"", over and over. If i was I was on the other side of the walkie talkie it would be on mute! If they don't hive the two toothpick boys a make-over for last season, (get those petitions going fans) The mushroom bowl hair cuts, thick eyebrows, shorts way above knee level!Actor Jake Busey in his cartoon switch, sounded like Jack Nicholson from the Shining, Not a compliment!""The Never Ending Story"" of the last season should be little old 11 be the special number now know as 13 lol. All her powers will be transferred to any loved character(s) for most episodes if not all. Switch it up creators as she is not the knees bees' for many viewers! Next year's creature is straight rip off of P*******!Actor Jake Busey in his cartoon switch, sounded like Jack Nicholson from the Shining, Not a compliment!""The Never Ending Story"" of the last season is little old 11 should be the special number now know as 13 lol.

Next year's creature is straight rip off of P*******!I did not binge this, was close to two weeks, which speaks volumes. Remember Season 1 where that Halloween every character was costume that year? Well that was one an done?! I hope the last forth season brings it back to that hype all across the board."
2269,"Just the best tv series i've ever watched and other things that can make you smile, dropped, angry, sad, and other things. And the casters are wonderful, especially millie bobby brown, she's the best of em all"
2270,"It is very cool to see a serial work on the relations of some children alongside of the main topic. i liked to see how to grew together and lived their lives hand in hand. in addition, what was very unique, regarding El, was the opportunity for us to see how humans behave; like how they lie sometimes or how they play roles. simultaneously, we have the chance to see that behavior learning not by a small child, but by a teenager who hasn't yet known them all due to her particular situation of life. Overall, i liked the main topic, and i liked how they grew up and after passing the childhood, entered the world of teenagers."
2271,"I watched all three seasons of the Stranger Things like ten + times .But none of them were boring. It's pretty teen stuff , but it's damn good if you watch it. Haters say it's waste of time watching this cuz they're haters anyway. Just watch it . You'll love it 💯💯"
2272,"I was the original people who first watched it and was a true fan to the show. Watching this last season, I was so happy for a new season and I watched all of the way through with a smile on my face and could never, ever. Ask for a better season. No..... A better show. Stranger Things is the best show in the world and I am excited for the next season. 😁😁"
2273,This season it's the best because I like group idea and the end all this group meet
2274,"Loved all the characters, the attention to detail on how being a kid should and use to be. I think thats what draws everyone together. A common consemsus before the divide, politics, PC, fake news, and horroble remakes and lacking plots. You could do 10 more of these in the 90s setting and I think it will still beat most movies these days."
2275,This is awesome because this tv show has a new idea and well written
2276,"If you haven't watched this series yet you need to stop what your doing and get watching! The character development, story , characters, cinematography and the groundbreaking CGI all of it equates into a masterpiece of a TV series. Each season is as good as the last if not better!"
2277,"Okay so not everyone thinks season 3 was great but I loved the nostalgia of it all, each episode was fun to watch and always kept you wanting to watch more.
Yes it has many references and copied features from 80s film and TV but for me it was done in a fun tongue in cheek way, yes it's silly, yes it's daft in parts but it's entertaining and that's what matters.
My only question is, why the overload of Coke (Cola) advertising? Was they funding this season? 😂"
2278,"I love everything in this tv show except the kisses sences it's a lot :)
Anyway the show is awesomeThanks!"
2279,"Except ""The Lost Sister"" all the episodes never bored me."
2280,"Disclaimer: As stated in the title this is a spoiler free review of Stranger Things Season 3 but I will be talking about plot points and minor spoilers from Season 1 & 2.So Stranger Things 3 picks up where we left off after season 2, everyone is happy and everyone is together, there is love in the air, it is the summer of love. Right off the bat I can say I preferred this season over season 2. This season felt more contained, it felt like it had a purpose and knew what it was doing and where is was going. Season 2 for me felt more of a mess, especially with ""The Lost Sister"" filler episode. The reviews of that episode tanked so hard that the writers completely gave up on that subplot, and I'm glad they did. That is one of the many reasons season 3 feels so much more crisp, because Matt and Ross Duffer decided to be more focused on the main story.As always the cast this season is great, the kids are now older and feel more like seasoned actors and much more mature in their performances. The kids stand out and shine more in this season especially with the addition of a couple of new characters. The adult characters are great as well, but a lot of them (apart from the main ones) felt wasted and underdeveloped. For example, in true 1980's form, we have evil Russians, which sounds hilarious but falls flat. The reason season 1 shined more than this or season 2 is because it had a well defined shadowy government department with a leader who was well developed. Remember ""papa"" from season 1? aka Dr. Martin Brenner. He was a menacing villain who had purpose and reasons for his experimentations on children and trying to open a gateway to the upside down. Plus we had the Demogorgon, which became a huge costume choice during halloween that year. It's cute that the kids in season 1 called the beast ""Demogorgon"" and in season 2 started calling the bigger beast ""Mind Flayer"" because that is their only visual reference they can give it, being fans of Dungeons and Dragons they named those beasts after creatures in D&D.But here in season 3 we have evil Russians being bad for the sake of the 1980's stereotype. This is my one and only problem with this season, a lack of a villain with a purpose. But all that doesn't matter much in the grand scheme of things in the season with the ""Mind Flayer"" being back. Season 3 definitely improves its writing and storytelling from season 2, even if we put aside evil Russians we still have the introduction of a very well developed Russian scientist. I won't give anymore details about him to keep this spoiler free.Let's go to the mall, and what a mall it is. Starcourt mall is by far one of the best sets, art direction, production design, props, lighting, costumes, extras that I have seen in a series. It is amazing, literally the highlight of the season. They made it feel so authentically 1980's America, licensing dozens of brands to further elevate the authenticity. They didn't just build a set on a sound stage, they found an abandoned mall and built the inside from the ground up, innards, lighting, fixtures, branding, shops etc. They made it a fully functioning mall. That level of detail makes the mall so much more immersive for the viewers and probably for the actors in the scenes as well. For me, the mall was the scene stealer more than anything else. Each character/group goes on their own adventure and purpose to complete a task or uncover some information. There are a few really good plot points and twists and interesting new characters and old recurring characters throughout the season and it felt so wholesome. The second half of the season is much stronger and even got me quite emotional.Rating: I'm giving Stranger Things Season 3 an 8.5 out of 10.
After 3 seasons this show doesn't just feel like a one hit wonder, although with a slightly rocky second season, season 3 comes back to form and delivers a satisfying narrative reminiscent of season 1. Even without a purposeful/menacing human villain this season still goes strong with tons of 80's nostalgia and easter eggs. If you have seen season 1 & 2 you will want to see this season as it is not a disappointment. Lucas's younger sister Erica, is another scene stealer along with the Russian scientist Alexei. Keep an eye out for those characters as you watch the season."
2281,"It's very good tv series, i enjoyed watching but some moments were very cringe and pissed me off like dusty and suzie song and especially the moment with hoppers and will's mom in the car and when they shut down reactor"

Rating: I'm giving Stranger Things Season 3 an 8.5 out of 10.
After 3 seasons this show doesn't just feel like a one hit wonder, although with a slightly rocky second season, season 3 comes back to form and delivers a satisfying narrative reminiscent of season 1. Even without a purposeful/menacing human villain this season still goes strong with tons of 80's nostalgia and easter eggs.

2283,"Awesome,just simply amazing!!! Loved it,waiting for another season"
2284,"I seriously don't understand all the negative reviews for season 3 of Stranger Things. I wonder if most of the reviews are from people that even watched the show. It completely and totally fits in with the story. The acting is fine as well as the dialogue. All the humor is natural and does not seemed forced. Love the growing up and growing apart theme and the multi character story all coming together was put together brilliantly. I don't get the hate, other than that's what people do these days."
2285,"This is the best netflix show that I have ever watched. This is my first review and it deserved it....
The child actors steal the show. All the actors did a phenomenal job.I was just hooked after the first episode.If you're thinking to give it a try, don't think just do it."
2286,"Stranger things is one of the best series I have ever watched, there are suspense, supernatural power, jokes, family group all together in a context alone. My favorite character is Eleven because she is the strongest, shows what she has already passed and she surpasses all this. For me this show is 9/10"
2287,Loved every ounce of this show. Glued from the moment I started watching till the last episode.
2288,"Stranger Things is a 1980s inspired and themed science fiction horror Netflix show. The show is set in November 1983 and takes place in the fictional town of Hawkins. Hawkins residence live a fairly normal life until a boy named Will Byers goes missing in the woods. Three of Wills friends Mike Wheeler (played by Finn Wolfhard), Lucas Sinclair (played by Caleb McLaughin) and Dustin Henderson (played by Gaten Matarazzo) are very worried for him but what they uncover something more dark and sinister. After looking for their missing friend they come across a girl, who they call Eleven because of her tattoo. However they soon find out this isn't any ordinary girl but one with very special powers. It is very clear the show takes lot of inspiration from classics 80's films like The Goonies and ET.The performances from all of the cast are great especially the child actors, who show the right amount of charisma and banter you expect from kids growing up in the 80's. However, the star of the show here is definitely Eleven (played by Millie Bobby Brown) who plays the ET type of role in show. Millie's brilliant acting skills have a lasting effect on the viewer even though she has 42 words throughout the whole series.The Duffer Brothers brilliant writing and directing skills play with your emotions to create a love letter to all those 80's horror films. It's truly something special! 9/10"
2289,First season and first episodes are little bad and boring but season 2 is amazing.Thats it all
2290,"I wasn't sure about the series at first but then I decided to watch and i was not let down, this series is unbelievably Good, its really Watch Worthy, and it makes it more awesome because its in the 80's or 90's. Its a must watch. Go watch now. Its worth it."
2291,Really good! One of the best series I have ever watched.
2292,Great story and wonderful acting by the kids. A must watch show more than that you can even watch with family. Looking forward for promising 3rd season.
2293,Unique plot nice production.. this is surely a worth watching show. U will not be disappointed
2294,"I think the casting was great and the storyline is great too. Overall it's a very amazing series. My only complaint is that I don't think the actress who plays eleven is that good of an actress, I think her character lacks a lot of depth, but of course that's just my opinion. It looks generic when you first look at it but it is much more complex then it seems (such as the mystery surrounding Hopper's daughter and the many different theories surrounding it)."
2295,"Really good. They've also captured the 80s theme really well . Great script, great acting, great directing."
2296,"It's just awesome, just watch it.
It will can hook you."
2297,"Best Tv Show, Waiting for Season 3, Netflix has done amazing job"
2298,"Not many series from Netflix are good.
But this is one of the best, if not the best series from Netflix original.Every actor is doing there part. Scripts are great. Special effects are great. Characters are great. Everything is just perfect. Well almost off course.
Or else it would have been a boring show.Session 1 I would have gave it a 10/10
Session 2 is great but not perfect 9/10
I hope session 3 will not end up in disaster...."
2299,This one of the best show I have ever seen. It has the right kind of creepiness I like and the story is fantastic the actors are amazing! There is how ever a lot of profanity. Still amazing show. And one more thing it's hilarious.
2300,"This show has been a game-changer for our current generation of T.V. shows. This 80's-based Sci-fi Drama covers the struggles of growing up, along with monsters and supernatural dimensions. I think this is an edge-of-your-seat kind of show, and I would recommend it to anybody looking for something good to watch."
2301,"Stranger Things is a adventure , action , and sci-fie series. The series was directed by the Duffer brothers. The cast is really good , the principal actors are teenagers , they are Finn Wolfhard , Noah Schnapp , Caleb Mclaughling ,Gaten Matarazzo , Millie bobby brown and Sadie sink. The story talks about a kid will played by N.Schnapp who eaten by a monster , the Demogorgon.
With his friend and his friends and family they must find him. I think is the best series because the story is so captivating , the visual effects and the costumes are very good . When you watch the series you should watch all the episodes."
2302,"Awesome show, you won't be disappointed. I give this a 6 because through out the show the character Mike is a real Debbie-downer and whines too much. Kill off or a change of casting would have been better. Much Better talent out there for that role."
2303,"This is my favorite series, from the first episode I got hooked. Every episode are supercool, I like everything about it and the OSD just awesome. I changed my rigntones and alert to the Underground sounds.The acting is great from all actors for those born in the early 80s late 70s you gotta live it !Really MUST watch. I can't wait for the saison 3 just hope it will be in part, they set the bar high on expectation ;)"
2304,"In my opinion this Series is awesome great. I don't know why some people don't like it. But, I respect their opinion. Great Actors, Scrip, story everything is awesome."
2305,"The best series I have seen so far.
Amazing and very exciting"
2306,"Personally I think it's a tiny bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, I really liked it but sometimes I just don't understand IMBD users. A show like this usually gets 5 out of 10 because it was predictable and the acting was bitter sweet (meaning some actors were astonishing and others awful). But it's still a very good show. The first season was a little more dark and intriguing then the second season which is probably what attracted all those fans. Season 2 had a slower pace and more humour. The action started during the last 4 episodes. I really enjoy those 80s vibe, that's probably my favourite aspect of the show. I guess what bothers me is the acting coming from Heaton (plays Jonathan Byers). Maybe I would have enjoyed that character more if the actor behind it wasn't a drug Addict. It's a real shame to be honest. Sometimes they overdramatize the script I find, particularly, Will Byers's in season 2 when he described his episodes. Other then that, I find it's a very entertaining show and I fell in love with Dustin, Steve, Eleven and many other great actors. Even if I find the show overrated and not phenomenal, I'm still anticipating for the next seasons. Hopefully they'll improve."
2307,"A Serie sad , and so low action don't like , to much hype for nothing to me ."
2308,"Im not going to bother with whats good, others have frothed at the mouth about that more than enough for all of us and quite a bit they are just goofy about.This show could be good if they took out some of the major annoyances and treated the story and audience with more basic respect.Cliche writing thats very out of touch with reality even for the 80s, for those of us who werent too stoned to remember it.Whats with the constant chain smoking idiots throwing cigarette butts, still burning, everywhere?Everyone is an alcoholic, most of the characters that arent total cardboard are still mostly filled in with a broad white trash spray gun base with a few bits tweaked.The characterization is pathetic.Generally they have between 30-70 percent of the content of a real story in an episode and the rest of the time is filled in with pathetic time waste shots of smoking and drinking for no real purpose.Its like these guys got paid by the tobacco lobbies.Whats with white trash framing to most of the characters and acting like this is normal? Its pathetic loser city for just about everyone. Do these writers have some kind of prejudice against middle class people in small town America?The Byers mother is annoying as it gets. She makes you want to shoot her with a tranq dart. Shes constantly just a hair short of losing it. They way overdo it with her far too often and for far too long every time. They put her in situations where no one would tolerate that for a fraction of the time they use it to fill up.Everyone runs scared and never takes the most basic precautions or notifies anyone when the find something or are about to do something stupid.Cliche evil scientists and men in black.Cliche jerk jocks, although Steve turns out to be more complex, but the trashy punk from Cali that you want to pound every 5 seconds, etc.Everyone in the 80s wasn't like, not even all poor people in the 80s in small towns. Its offensive and annoying that these guys have such a blatant bias to their characterization."
2309,"I love this retro styled series. When is the next one coming out??! The only thing I don't like is the bit where Nancy and Johnathan start to look like they are going to be more than friends - c'mon Hollywood, ever heard of platonic relationships? It's ok to feature them in a film once in a while! There's so much wrong with this oh so boringly typical storyline - girl gets stalked by guy, rather than keeping her distance (which would be the right thing to do) she falls in love with him, oh and as always she's conveniently a sexualised teenage school girl. Why are the writers always such paedos that want to push this script onto us?! Other than that I love all the other plot lines and characters. Sometimes the upside down storyline drags but I love how well thought out & authentic the era it's set in is!"
2310,This is awesome! The movie is very thrilling and time worthy. I just couldn't keep my eyes off the screen as I finished season 1 in a day! Can't wait for season 3
2311,"Winona Ryder SUCKS! Other than that, it really is a great show!"
2312,"Just watch ONE EPISODE & you'll love it!I ignored this show for awhile till everyone started talking about it & wow! Born in 84 I grew up in the 90's & watching 80's movies.
Nostalgia from ET & Stephen King Movies came flooding in. It seriously makes you believe you're watching an old 80's movie.
The Opening Music in the title freaking made me nostalgic! lol (on Netflix I have the option to Skip Intro, but can't do it, love the music.)"
2313,"What a stunning show. It manages to capture the 1980s nostalgia that has been missing from my world. It's sci-fi with a touch of horror. You need an empty bladder and a sofa to hide behind when it gets too scary!
The sets are amazing and believable with a sinister undertone. The actors are very well cast and it's enjoyable to watch them and the characters grow.
Enjoyed season one more than season two. Have to wait to see if season three takes it too far. Only time will tell."
2314,Vou até assistir novamente enquanto não chega a próxima temporada!!!
2315,"Another great show from Netflix with an 80's Goonies and ET feel to it that I love so much. Start watching this and you will certainly be hooked...
It has everything you need from a Sci-Fi, Action show with lots of Suspense, Great Acting and fabulous Music that is just SPOT ON....
I sooooooooo hope the second season is just as good 😁"
2316,"I enjoy the 80s setting/characters however too many major flaws in story that hurts overall quality of the series.First issue is in season one when the sheriff investigates the ""dead body of will"". He cuts it open to find it is a stuffed doll but they still bury the stuffed body the following day. A giant cut down the chest with stuffing coming out would clearly raise some questions.However what is more troubling is the fact that after Will is found, nobody in the entire city wonders...""If Will is alive, who is the kid we buried? Who faked his death?"" This event would unravel the government cover ups/secrets but the viewer is suppose to overlook this.Next, in season two the sheriff investigates the poison pumpkin/farm fields and gets trapped in the underground tunnels. After being rescued, no authorities were brought out to investigate despite the clear physical evidence they now have to prove their story about the other world.Also in the second season, the creatures attack the main lab and kill countless workers & securities officers because they were essentially immune to bullets. But when the sheriff is protecting 11 while closing the gate, all he needs is one shot per creature. Additionally, how do all those dead bodies not bring anymore attention to the real developing problem? Season ends with the government blaming a chemical spill for Barba's death. Ok that may be sufficient for her but what about the cause of death for the others?"
2317,"I just finished binge watching the first two seasons of Stranger Things. Each episode flew by with one exception. Season 2 Episode 7 was unnecessary and felt like something from a completely different series. Where all the other episodes held my interest from beginning to end, I was tempted to fast forward this subplot with the punk delinquents. There was nothing here that couldn't have been addressed in the other episodes in a few scenes; this was a distraction from the main story. I almost subtracted one star, but the series was way to good to rate less than a 10.I don't usually enjoy science fiction stories, but Stranger Things was easy to follow and didn't have the normal abstract story lines that many sci-fi movies do. The story was nearly perfect and the cast couldn't have been better. Kudos to Millie Bobby Brown and Noah Schnapp for jobs well done. One question; what's up with Steve's (Joe Keery) big hair? lolNetflix finally hit one out of the park and I can't wait to watch season 3!"
2318,"I love the 80s theme of this show, I feel so nostalgic and the music is great. This is one of my favorite TV shows and can't wait for next season!"
2319,"Just finished season 1 and all I can say is it's enthralling!
The young actors are superb!
It's a well crafted series with the Duffer Bro's doing their best work!
Eagerly watching season 2!
If you're a fan of the impossible it's a must see!
Brilliance throughout!
Season 2 is just as brilliant!
As the story unfolds it becomes a little clearer but I'm hoping for a season 3!
The cast is incredible and all actors give believable performances!
Hats off to Netflix n I won't be unsubscribing. Simply brilliant!"
2320,Great BIG GIANT 10 out of 10. The entire YOUNG staff is full of YOUNG ACTORS. And ACTRESS that are NOT to Popular BUT NOT TO Popular AND that is Great for THIS SHOW. It has a Terrific CAST and Winona Ryder. That is Awesome CONGRATULATIONS for her because she was REALLY COOL in the 80s. Not so much in the 90s. SHE still was BUT more in the 80s. And this SHOW is BASED in the 80s when she was VERY Popular. SO I THINK that's why she just steals this show. The YOUNG ACTRESS that Playes 11 WOW Great to see more of her WORK. Anyways I could go on but even Seran Astin in Season 2 he did a Great Job.
2321,"This is by far the BEST TV SHOW!
 For Adults it has that ""Goonies"" feel with ""It"" and ""E.T"" and they nailed the 80's look and the show is Spooky but not really Terrifying and it's fun and dramatic at the same time which makes it great!"
2322,"Within the first five minutes, I was hooked on the story. The pace is excellent, where you will never feel bored or rushed. Characters are developed well, with great stories of friendship, love and family. The acting is also on point - the chemistry is there. If you want a great thriller that is intriguing to the last minute, this is for you!"
2323,"This show is an amazing show, mixing many elements from the 80's (especially the films and music). It's two seasons are equally awesome, and it keeps me waiting for season three. I'd say people 13 and above would most likely be able to watch this, as long as they are experienced by watching famous 80's films like E.T. and maybe Alien."
2324,"This serie, brings me back to my childhood...
It's just amazing I just can recommend it !"
2325,"This show has all kinds of great elements - mystery, suspense, friendship, etc. The plot is very well written and the characters are very believable. I don't love the language. I feel like in the second season, it was just crammed in there. You don't need language to make a show interesting. Love the writing! Love the concept! Definitely a winner!"
2326,"What can I say it's bloody brilliant . I am so hooked I can't get it out of my head. I love everything about it the characters the story, I can't get enough. Give me more please Duffer brothers. I can't wait for season 3 ."
2327,This show is awesome!! So well written. Can't wait for more!
2328,This is definitely a show that is worth watching and I hope they continue the seasons unlike others they shut them down while keeping other shows going.
2329,Stranger Things is pretty good. I like the story and the acting.
2330,"Stranger things is one of the few tv shows that caught me right in the first minute. It's like a series I've always dreamed of became real. The music, the outfits, the setting everything is just perfect. I think there is no need to tell you how much I love the story. I love horror movies and everything surrounding the supernatural so it is just perfect, but even if you aren't that big of a fan of these genres you are going to like it, because there is so much more to it. Yes sometimes it gets a little bit creepy or ugly but the story is just to good let that stop you from watching. It's about friendship, love, coherence even though the main story is to save their friends it has so much more to tell. If you watch it you will go through every emotion. You will cry, you will laugh (more than you think), you will chatter, you will ponder. And now stop reading reviews just watch it!"
2331,"One of Netflix's few redeeming qualities, horror sci-fi in the classic style of Super 8 and Poltergeist. One of my favourites all-time alongside The Expanse, Ash vs Evil Dead and Game of Thrones."
2332,While watching this show I loved every second of it. It has a brilliant soundtrack and relatable characters. The cinematography was excellent and pulled you in. Brilliant
2333,"Stranger Things is an extraordinary Netflix Show. I watched both seasons and they were very entertaining. I love the setting, characters and overall style of it. Almost all of the characters are loveable (Dustin is my favorite) and the interactions between the characters are superb. The series hooked me instantly with its air of mystery. Overall I find Stranger Things to be a very enjoyable series to watch and would recommend it to people of all ages"
2334,The best science fiction series Strange Things I've ever seen
2335,"One of those shows so good you don't even know what's best - if the plot, the actors, the soundtrack or the setting.
A great experience."
2336,If you want to see anything which is a mixture of the title then you should definitely go watch it. It will take back to 1980s time and also upside down side of the world(dark side).
2337,The theme is not my normal go to but a few episodes in and I was hooked. Great SYFY fantasy.
2338,"As strange as they are this show was the only netflix show I watched in my life, it's a great show indeed and I couldn't recommend it enough, waiting for next season"
2339,"The show is highly entertaining. It has ample scopes in proceeding with sequels. The kids acting were awesome and although we don't see much of a neighborhood, the story kept coming. It was clear and probably intentional to acknowledge the inspirations from Spielberg's, King's It and some local myths. I felt more similarities, perhaps a rip-off, to JJ's Super 8. Although it's good, I was slightly disappointed because I watched this show first and wondered at the originality."
2340,"Utterly brilliant series that can help you escape reality and be entertained by great 80's nostalgia with a mixture of comedy, horror, romance and thriller what works and fits together perfectly. The series also consists of a gripping emotional story with great character development.
I don't understand how people can rate this as low as 1or 2/10 how small minded and not easily please are some people it's ridiculous."
2341,"Aside from having a well-paced and interesting sci-fi plot, Stranger Things has many many subtle references and motifs to films of the 1980s - but without going so far as to blatantly rip them off. No, Stranger Things is entirely it's own creation. It just so happens to be a sci-fi story set in the world of the 1980s.If you are at least 40 years old, you are going to love this show because of the extra nostalgia factor. It takes me back to a time of youthful wonder when we all got Atari for Christmas, and rode our bikes with our friends in the street until dark. Younger viewers will not only enjoy the story but get a glimpse of what it must have been like to live in a time before smartphones and the internet changed everything.For the movie buff, half the fun is picking out the late 1970s early 1980s movie references that Stranger Things hints at but never completely gives away. There's very subtle visual clues and shot-for-shot scene recreation from ""E.T."", ""Stand By Me"", ""The Thing"", ""The Evil Dead"", ""Jaws"", ""Aliens"", ""Predator"", ""The Goonies"", ""Halloween"", ""Carrie"", ""Flight of the Navigator"", ""Ghostbusters"", ""Gremlins"", ""Cujo"", ""Mad Max"", ""Poltergeist"", ""The Karate Kid"", ""The NeverEnding Story"", ""The Gate"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Back to the Future"", ""The Warriors"", ""BloodSport"", ""Heathers"", and ""Star Wars""... and probably quite a few more that escape me at the moment. How this is handled is incredibly subtle, and you wouldn't notice the split-second references unless you've seen all of those classic movies - immediately bringing a sense of ""movie deja-vu"" when they happen on screen.If you love anything sci-fi and are nostalgic for the 1980s, then Stranger Things is essential binge watching."
2342,"I know, I know, this isn't horror at all, but I recommend it to all horror fans for the sake of nostalgia.I really enjoyed watching this. When the show first came out, I was avoiding it for quite some time because of the hype being too big. Eventually, I forgot about it until Season 2 dropped. All of my friends were telling me to watch it, and so I did. I saw the entire series twice by now, and I play on watching it a third time before Season 3.I don't really wanna talk about the story, as I think this is best experienced blind. The performances in this show are amazing. The child actors were genuinely fantastic. Now, as much as I'm praising this show, it's not flawless. Some teen actors were weak at some points, and there is one really bad episode (S02 E07), but it's achievements outweigh the flaws, which is why I'm giving it a 9 out of 10."
2343,Yaa I'm relly late. I just watched and finished this film for 3days.. this film really amazing... can't wait to watch season 3!
2344,"Some shows are disappointing and turn your life upside down. However Stranger Things is one of these few shows with a good setting, story and developed characters (apart from the lost sister which we do't talk about). When i was first told to watch it i didn't, i misjudges the show mainly because of the name and i knew it featured children actors which are normally bad, which they aren't in this. I finally watched the show and i regretted not watching it sooner. I enjoyed nearly every moment from the series and liked pretty much every characters for there complexity. I love the 80's time setting and the music is stunning.A side note, i really hope this show doesn't get too mainstream and looses its plot, season 1 had a thick plot, season 2, average but it looks like the plot has been watered down too much for season 3 so they can appeal to a simple minded demographics are on their phones when they watch,"
2345,"Great show, great plot, great cast, and great special effects"
2346,"I hate this show, i hate your mom, i hate people who recommend this show for me, and most of all I HATE THE GAY NIBBA WITH THE GOD DAMN BOWL CUT FOR CHRISTS SAKE PLEASE VOMIT OUT A DEAD DOG INSTEAD OF A SLUG! but i enjoyed when he jumped of a cliff so what evs. 10/10. BUuUuUuUT THIS SHOW TOTALLY RIPPED OF THE HALLOWEEN EPISODE OF THE ORIGINAL SPONGEBOB! IF YOU DONT BELIVE ME THEN IF YOU LOOK AT ONE OF THE SCENES IN THE CRUST CRAYEYEYEAB YOU CAN SEE A FISH WITH A BOWL CUT. and you know who else has a bowl cut? SLUGGY MCGEE! THE KID WHO JUMPED OFF A CLIFF BECAUSE HE WAS PART OF THE SIXTH SENSE PT2. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALSO LIKE, EVERY KIDS PARENTS GET DIVORCED SO NO NEED TO DO A OLYMPIC DIVE INTO AN EMPTY POOL. but its whatevs i guess its totes retro"
2347,"One of the best shows I've ever seen! Perfect first season and a little worse second, but still good. Perfect music and sounds, let you feel that vibe of the 80's. Plot is realy interesting and addictive. When I started SF I couldn't wait for watching it day by day, I did it in one."
2348,"First fictional horror series with children leads, and they nailed it. I must say the leads have done their job like adults.
What made my mind to change the rating from 10 to 9 is second season, because it wasn't as great as first season but still cast did their best.
I'll give this series the rating of 'very good' not more than that. The direction of the series is great and so as the screenplay. But it would've been great if character 'Eleven' has more dialogues because fans would love that.
Till now it's a piece of work that needed to be appreciated hope they would do great in further coming seasons. And seeing forward the character 'Eleven' with more dialogues on screen.
This is something which have their leads who are still kids and series is rated not to be watched by kids."
2349,"A wonderful throwback to 80's blockbuster classics such as ET and Goonies. The first season is far better than the second, but still enjoyable. Every actor is excellent. The casting director doesn't get the credit they deserve. If you can't find something to like about 'Stranger Things', you're probably not a pleasant person to be around. Bravo, Duffer Bros."
2350,"Such a charming, captivating, intelligent and thrilling adventure this sequel is. Actors' performances were so good that I felt what each of them was supposed to feel in the movie. I am greatly impressed by the interesting plot - about the dark side of things and people or ""the upside down"", as they called it. Amazing child actors - their honest and faithful friendship made me remember what true friendship (and human relationships in general) must be like.
These series aren't just a well made sci-fi compilation; they are a lesson in quality human relationships and a reminder of honorable values.
I am certainly hoping for another season!"
2351,"Really great. There are not a lot of series I'll binge-watch over a weekend, but this one is worth it. Great acting, great plot. Definitely worth the time."
2352,"Excellent work, every character has played he's part. Excellent story it's like a cross between E.T and X-Files. Superb 10/10. Please continue bringing more series and keep the original cast."
2353,"It is not hard to see why a show like Stranger Things has captivated so many and I am glad so many are taken by it. The mystery, build up, supernatural elements that is woven together by a nostalgic 80s theme has proven to be a successful mix. One of strengths of this show is it perceived mainly from the view of a few close friends in their small town. This gives the viewer a simple and easy lens to watch and enjoy the whole mystery unravel. We do not have to play catch up from a complicated point of view but see the world from a simple black and white view. The performances are great and the characters are memorable, some are clearly better than others. A strong and enjoyable show, cannot wait for season 3.8/10"
2354,I know this is 2017 and we are supposed to be open to everything. But listening with earbuds on a subway I just cannot understand the kid who states on the show his teeth are growing in. Why pick this kid I cant even hear what he is saying. Honestly I just started watching this but not sure I can go on if he has a lot of speaking parts. Honestly not sure he was a good choice for the verizon commercial either. Yes indeed I said it in 2017. Gave my opinion.
2355,"For those who remember the show the Blob, it has same gooey thing. I think the show is very dragged on and can cut a lot of scenes. Seriously too similar to the Blob. It is nostalgic, that's the only cool thing. How video cameras were the coolest and newest things. Radio Shack was still alive, etc. We need writers like Breaking Bad and The walking Dead"
2356,Children and crew.. If you are reading this.. I want you to know that YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME!! Thanks for giving us this masterpiece! Keep up the good work guys. Never give up!
2357,"With only 8 episodes in the first season, this show will certainly not keep you busy for a long time. But after watching it, you will not be disappointed as this wild adventure will keep you guessing and asking for more throughout all 8 episodes. The pace at which the story reveals itself is great, giving almost every character their moment to shine with just the correct length of screen time. This allows the story to flow very well with little to no fillers. It was interesting to see a mashup of character personalities and how they blend together in the show. Since there were distinct focuses on three separate groups of people (the children, young teens, and adults), people from all generations can relate to and find pleasure watching the show. One of the key components that make this a great show is the use of manipulation. As the story-line progresses, there are multiple moments of loud crackles of sound and lights flickering on and off. The sound and lighting manipulations are what drive suspense and thrills that got me hooked on. Furthermore, I also think the method used to reveal the antagonist is clever. The antagonist is revealed a little more, during every encounter, in every subsequent episode. This made me look forward to watching the remaining episodes even more. In addition, the overall feel and atmosphere of the show is very nostalgic. Many similarities from the X-files, E.T, and the Goonies can be found in Stranger Things which makes this series all the more magnificent. I came across Stranger Things and decided to give it a watch due to the mysterious synopsis. Since Netflix released all 8 episode at once, I was able to binge-watch the entire first season. I am sure this dark and mysterious story will give most people massive excitement in all 8 episodes. I hope the second season is just as good, if not better, because the season ends with an unexpected cliffhanger. As this is my first review, I cannot be certain what qualities a television show must exhibit in order to receive a high rating but personally, I think Stranger Things definitely deserves a 9/10."
2358,"The show is amazing. The way it builds suspense with it's amazing soundtrack is masterful. The characters and writing in general is outstanding, and the creepy scenes are just creepy enough it gives you that adrenaline rush but not to creepy that it will scar you for life. And despite what many people say I found that there wasn't that much gore. Yes you see some get shot in the first episode and in the second you see that same person with a bit of blood running down the side of his head and some flies around him. That's it for the first season basically.And the second season, all you see is some blood on a cat, and later you do see a person getting eaten but his body is covered by the creature eating him so you don't really see that much in terms of gore.If you want my personal age rating, I'd say 13-15 depending on the child, but unless you child doesn't handle scary things well it should be fine for the average 13 year old."
2359,"Absolutely Brilliany series , Remarkable pace The Only irritating thing for me is when eleven Bleeds through her nose she does not clean it up immediately and goes on with doing other chores :) Kinda really upsetting for an OCD like me :)"
2360,when we watched the first chapter it was epic i would buy netflix to get this show like how there is kids because in most shows aldult drama but there's actually kids in this acting part and i like how eleven does that that cool power there's slime creatures every other show has no action so also the whole storyline is perfect the graphics and the acting i would recommend to watch this show.
2361,"Stranger things Is great. it has great acting and an amazing story line. There is great chemistry between the actors. I loved the new characters in season 2 like Max and Bob. I read some of the other reviews and some people wrote that they didn't like Max or the other new characters but I think they were great and that they will help the show develop in the future. Also, to the people that wrote shitty reviews: you should get checked by a doctor 'cause Stranger Things is amazing. It was so good that I finished season 2 in one night. If you haven't watched it, watch right now and stop wasting time."
2362,"This television show is one of a kind. At first I was hesitant to watch it mainly because i'm not a fan of science fiction, but I can say this show was amazing. It is a bit predictable at some times but there is also a lot of thrill in it that keeps you on your toes. The actors and actresses are amazing and that is a big part of what makes a show interesting to watch. I feel involved with the emotions of Stranger Things and that keeps me interested. I like the long episodes but I do wish there were more episodes in each season because it feels too short. But the length of them almost makes up for it. I also enjoyed this show because it reminded me of the horror movie I have seen, The Poltergeist. Watching Stranger Things made me think back to The Poltergeist and I could remember what was happening so I felt more involved. Another thing I loved about Stranger Things was that the time period it was in, was the early eighties and that's one of my favorite eras! The aesthetic of it was amazing. The whole set made me feel like I was watching an actual movie from the eighties and I loved it. This show is pretty original, mainly in the way it is portrayed in the 1980's so that makes it feel a lot more original. It's addictive to watch but it's like that because at times it can be scary but it also has a reality to it (besides the monster) and you just get attached to the characters. I feel like every person who watches Stranger Things has a character they can relate to. Each character has a strong personality and the actors/actresses do a very good job at portraying that character. The main characters are four young boys who love anything about science. They are in middle school but very smart. Of course they get bullied, this makes me more emotionally attached because I know what it is like to have that happen. But all these characters have their own problems that people can relate to and it gets people attached. It does have a bit of a cliché to it. How the perfect suburban teenage girl likes the wealthy jock and they like each other. Then she becomes friends with the school weirdo and the other boy gets jealous and starts rumors. I have only watched season one so far so I don't know what is going to happen with that, but like I said, a bit of a cliché. This show is so exciting! There's plot twists all over and at times it can be way funny. But I also like how scary it can be. Stranger Things is full of cliffhangers, surprises and lots of laughs. At times though it can be really sad. If you get emotionally attached to any of the characters you may find yourself sad sometimes in certain scenes. There is some profanity in it but not too much to handle. I really don't care about that but I would say kids younger than 12 shouldn't watch this because of that and how scary it can be. I highly recommend this television show."
2363,"The show is really something special. Probably one of the best shows of recent years.It takes some of the best elements of 80's movies like Goonies or E.T. mixes them up with modern thriller and sci-fi elements to create a really amazingly fun and unique adventure.Awesome cast, great performances - especially Millie Brown. Exciting story, at times scary, other times funny and charming with lot's of 80's references.I just can't forget Sean Astin's Goonies-reference line ""Yeah? What's at the X? Pirate treasure?"". Him having this role and this line in a recent and successful TV show is just so good..!Season 2 was a bit lesser awesome as i thought some things were a bit too predictable. Overall also less scary feel. I also felt some things like the whole story of Kali (indian Girl) was a bit cut too short, and Kali's gang was a bit too stereotypical.But in anyway this is one of the greatest shows to watch at the moment, and i think it's so far the best Netflix Original."
2364,"Stranger Things is so captivating.The young actors perform with so much emotion and honesty, and the plot is so surreal, I don't think older actors would be able to make everything seem so realistic.And Winona Ryder... I've always liked her, loved seeing her in Black Swan, after Stranger Things I became a huge fan.Love Stranger Things, Winona, Will and Eleven."
2365,"I love this series. this show kinda reminds me of silent hill with the creepy darkness. I hope they do another season of this.This thrilling Netflix original drama stars Golden Globe-winning actress Winona Ryder as Joyce Byers, who lives in a small Indiana town in 1983 -- inspired by a time when tales of science fiction captivated audiences. When Joyce's 12-year-old son, Will, goes missing, she launches a terrifying investigation into his disappearance with local authorities. As they search for answers, they unravel a series of extraordinary mysteries involving secret government experiments, unnerving supernatural forces, and a very unusual little girl."
2366,"I was inspired to write this review due to some nagging possible inconsistency of detail.Regarding the spoiler warning. I've gone to great lengths to be too vague to spoil anything for new viewers. Anyone who has watched both seasons may recognize spoiler type info or it will seem familiar, if not obvious. To those who have not watched they should not understand any ""spoiling"" information.This review is regarding both season one and season two. I re-watched season one before watching season two, shortly after it was released.I'm troubled I had forgotten so much of what happened in season one. I felt at times I was seeing things I had never watched before. So, if you grew up around the 80s when this takes place, or your prone to a Swiss Cheese memory, you might want to re-watch season one as I did. To me it was well worth it.Since season one seemed to ""conclude"" pretty well, I wasn't not confident about what direction the second season may take. I believe season two surpassed season one in every way.My favorite characters were El, and Hopper. The primary characters are obviously the club of Nerd kids which gets an addition in season two. I was always anticipating the next scene about either El, or Hopper.In episode 203 forward, Dustin's thread with his new discovery was disturbing to me in the way one may watch a horror show when the screaming teens decide to go back into the monster's lair with only a lame reason instead of escaping.For spoiler's sake Dustin's thread is nothing like said screamer horror movie plot. The relation is in how it made me feel while watching it. Call it anticipated but postponed dread.I was also taken by surprise with episode 207, The Lost Sister. Nothing wrong with this episode. It perfectly fills plenty of plot points in the season, including answering some likely forgotten questions raised early in episode 201. To me, it seemed to interrupt the flow of the story line suddenly, unexpectedly, and abruptly.El's entire thread from late episode 206 until near the end of episode 208 seemed unrelated to much of anything. That information may be extremely important in future episodes and it did fill a few holes in season two including a dramatic piece of the climax of the season, so it was not insignificant. It just seemed I was driving down one street in episode 205 and in episode 206 suddenly came out of a blackout on a different street, going a different direction.This motivating inconsistency was nothing blatant but I've written fiction for decades and notice some things others may not notice.FAIR WARNING: To avoid IMDb SPOILER worries, I would claim this may be a spoiler but it is such a small thing overall that I doubt it could spoil anything. It may give someone who has watched the series an urge to re-think this detail. It regards water and antagonists who seem averse to water.My point is... at least one co-protagonists is aware of this aversion and it seemed to me, if I was aware of this detail it would have effected my character's behavior, particularly in episode 208 or 209 in regards to ""Bob"" (Sean Austin, a favorite actor to me.) and his brave activities in one scene. In retrospect it kept occurring to me he likely had the means to make the ever present ""escape from danger"" a LESS DRAMATIC affair. Not exactly a writer's goal for any scene I know well.Once the water aversion occurred to me, post season, and thinking back, it seemed this aversion to water was mentioned and then the writers forgot about it until it was needed much later, but then never used it when it could have been helpful to the co-protagonists. I may be barking up an upside-down tree as I believe the only person who was obviously conscious of this antagonist ""weakness"" was ever Bob.Bob was a rather minor character and was ""out of the loop"" nearly always. When he was consulted and discovered this possible weapon against the antagonist it was during an intense, urgent, and time sensitive search for answers to save an important character. Those who could have employed Bob's new knowledge more effectively could have easily ""missed it"" or it just never impressed them as important. But it nagged at me.So there it is. Just seems weird to me this knowledge about ""water"" would have been extremely valuable from the time it was discovered until the conclusion of the season. I only imagine few times or places it would have been helpful, but nothing using the known weapon vs. the antagonist was ever apparently considered.Still, 9 stars for both seasons without a doubt. Writers and producers were exceptionally clever on multiple levels and I never felt any actor was ""acting"".One more ""water"" thought... In season one the antagonist has an event with Barbara Holland (actress Shannon Purser) in, and over a swimming pool when Barb is bleeding after cutting her hand attempting a party drinking stunt. If season one antagonist is related to season two's antagonist, and that seems likely, this seems another inconsistency with my nagging water aversion theory."
2367,"-No Spoilers here- :) I am not a person of much words, i don't write reviews often. Started watching Stranger Things.. and i had to write about it! At first i was like 'darn a E.T. wanna-be-copycat' but i was wrong, its even better than E.T.! The character development, excellent acting, great story telling, a exciting adventure, beautiful 1980 set. If you haven't already seen Stranger Things than you are missing out! -Spoilers here- Season 1 A lab in the tiny city of Hawkins do tests on children, to make them create (or already have) special abilities, Eleven is one of the those kids, after one of the tests she opens a gate between the real world and the upside down (a other dimension). Will (one of the kids) goes missing after he got stuck in the upside down, not knowing where Will is, his mom, a Cop and his best friends are risking there lives to find Will. Thats about Season 1 in a nutshellSeason 2 After They got Will back out the Upside-Down, he is haunted by a large Shadow monster, in 1 of the episode's the monster infiltrated Will's body and soul, slowly the monster starts to take over Will's body and makes life again a little bit more Cr*py in Hawkins. In the meanwhile 'Eleven' goes on a hike searching for her mother, but once she finds her mother she can only see how the lab made her into a plant. With great anger inside eleven goes further on adventure (this is where things get boring ha-ha, so i wont tell more about it) Once Eleven returns to Hawkins she finds the city in great danger of -DemoDogs and the Shadow monster, which is slowly taking over the city from under its foundations. Only Eleven can save the day now! And she succeeded with the help of her friends. And they live happy ever after.... but for how long?Counting down for season 3, only 1 year to go! Forgive me for my bad English."
2368,This show gets unappreciated for what it is. Winona Ryder gave one of her best performances of her entire career. She definitely deserved an Emmy. The kids were the best kid actors I have ever seen on television. David Harbour started off as a character no one liked but got better throughout the episodes in season 1. Every episode engaged me more each time. Suspense was always built up and the music gave me the feeling of a sci-fi movie and a thriller film. I hope this show wins the award for best drama.
2369,This series is about things that are strange stranger things it's amazing it's so good I was Hoocked two or three episodes episodes in . even tho I was wondering why am I hooked I don't like but I do. It's so good kids killed it it's so amazing its about a kid named will and his missing from town. from the 80s and ET and Steven kings novels and 80s said nostalgia the cop also is amazing he is so good he is investing and interesting and deserves nomination. these kids deserve enemies that's how good they. Warning spoilers are coming so u r warned 11 was amazing one of the best characters is the who show if this doesn't start i career I don't what does she oops almost think it is a he. 11 is so good and deserves A Emmy i don't know why she doesn't have a nomination unless she does one Of The scenes that I starting liking the show was when u starting caring for these characters in this show. It had great dialogue in this series s. One of my favourite scenes is when 11 shows off her super powers I felt how the kids felt cause I was a kid and I felt the connection they did I was actually a kid unlike kids now. actors today never get sprites that kids say kids say kids things like me when I was a kid a kid. I There r scenes that r just like ET like when they all are talking to each other and it's like ET and stand by me they have the power guy which is 11 and then it was ET they have a scene on the train track it's literally stand by me and then they have Goonies things like so many times then they have so many references the one thing that makes it not a perfect series. But it's not two grades down because of that it's not ET or standing by me for me it's not that level of goodness but it's good tho and don't get disappointing . Its just a series or is it. back on topic it's so good. when will is missing the people think the mom is crazy but later we find out she is not crazy the things out kids say kids things like me when I was a kid a Re crazy when will is found he is very bad and is sick and barely survives it's sad but true. The kids think it is gone but the monster is still out there. To cap off the review it is a entertaining series just a mystery. The kids and adults do good thing s so I would say 8.5 out of 10 it's amazing and the best show in years dispose me not watching any shows in years 😂
2370,"First and foremost, Stranger Things is a very entertaining show. The acting, 80's references and a general lighthearted tone all mash to make a compelling show. The entire first season is about find Will Byers, a 12 year old boy that disappeared into the ""Upside Down"" a alternate dimension that corresponds with our world. After Will disappears, his friends find a girl (nicknamed Eleven) that says she knows where Will is. There are subplots that interlock with the story that are all interesting. When I first heard about the show, the idea of a show built around child actor worried me a bit. Child actors, mostly, fall into two categories: genuine and disingenuous. Luckily the excellent direction from the Duffer Brothers and the performances from the kids fall into the former. 80's culture is perfectly ingrained into the story. There isn't too many, nor are they made the focal point of show. The film grain on the show is subtle enough to be noticeable to the audience, but again, is not too obvious. The music is mostly good, but it can be too electronic at times. My problems with the show start with the demogorgon, a monster that lives in the Upside Down. **Minor spoilers** The demogorgon comes into real life through the wall in a sequence that feels like a bad sequel to The Last of Us. The build up for the creature is immense, but both the look and actions of the monster fall flat. Scenes like this lack real stakes, and this does not have much tension. **Major Spoilers** The last major scene has Eleven sacrifice herself to the demogorgon as she disappeared into the Upside Down. This was entirely forced and contrived. The series builds Eleven as essential to the puzzle that is the Upside Down, but this scene uses her as a plot device. It is your classic set up for another season that shies away from themes introduced through the entire season. It's a shame.But those are just a few of my complaints. I doubt most people will have a problem with them. Overall though, it's just such a fun show to watch and I'm excited to see where it goes. Happy Bingeing!"
2371,"Well for my first review ...This series are Epic for a scary on a regular basis maybe 15 years for my opinion well i did see only 2 episodes and my excitement for what will happen next has no words to explain . Well for me it will be the epic intro for the new Alien movie :P , i feel a lot of dramatic content and it is my most newly experience of this sort of a movie mix."
2372,"Stranger Things is a series that takes us back to the good old 80's and 90's. By watching it we are automatically referred to this time when the Steven Spielberg films were alarmingly successful. ET; Carrie; And so many other films of the genre seem to be reminiscent of excerpts from Stranger Things, which leaves the viewer with that air of nostalgia and this is a good emotional effect that TV shows and well- made movies cause in viewers. I really appreciate that genre."
2373,"Stranger things is a product of 2016 and people should pay attention to this. It surely used old well-known elements or settings from the 1980s but I believe that people should stop thinking of films in the 80s and stop comparing it to them. Let us take a look at the series objectively and from the modern point of view ! Surely it belongs to a genre that was started a long time ago and the 1980 nostalgia exists but please do not overreact because of this fact. Analyzing STRANGER THINGS in short: 1. The most important part of a cinema masterpiece or a TV series is the script. The script is just great, keeps you interested and does not involve retarded mistakes or plot holes. Some scenes might develop in a more obvious way that I like (i.e. not so original) and some words might not be the perfect choice in some cases /IMHO at least/... Then again originality is rarer than gold these days. But to be honest the script as a whole is just fine through the whole season 1. The script here lays a great and sturdy foundation of the ""family house"" the creators are building. A house of mystery, fear and bravery, of action and of basic human emotions. 2. The actors are amazing. The kids are natural, Dustin in particular is just the kind of kid that people will love and the kind of actor that is acting using his talent and to the best of his ability. Winona Ryder gives us a lot of strong emotions to chew and surely lives up to the image of a movie star she had in the past /and probably never lost/. 3. The effects are probably not the maximum possible movie high-tech wonder but they look cool and fitting to the main atmosphere. I surely do not expect more of the FX team for season 2. 4. The more you watch, the more interested you are. It does not get boring. Stranger Things does not crumble because of some soap opera motives like ARROW did. 5. You just have to like kids and sci-fi to watch, if you do not like kids just get out of here. :) ------------------------------------- Obvviously it is not plausible to just talk about what I liked about Stranger Things so let me point out some weak spots: - the bad guys often behave in a stupid and inert way - the cop sometimes takes weird decisions - several things in the last episode were very unacceptable, I don't wish to include spoilers...If Game of Thrones should get the gold medal for the best series of 2016, Stranger Things goes home with the silver ! 9/10"
2374,"I got to tell you, Stranger Things is one hell of an awesome ride since I've watched the movie Super 8 for the first time back then. There's no spoilers, so you're good. I must say, in my opinion, this show felt like Super 8 but it's more thrilling than Super 8, but it's very entertaining. I recommend you guys to watch it if you have not seen it yet. :)What I also like about this show is that it's from a Co-Executive Producer who once produced a TV Film Adaptation of Disney's Tower of Terror. :)"
2375,"Actor's very good especially child actor Gaten Matarazzo and David Harbour. Series look like a Stephen King books, Alien and E.T. Monster scenes and jumpscare so scary but I love it. I think series very fast. Soundtrak list great. I felt in 80's, Dungeon and Dragons, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars citations perfect. A great example for sci-fi. I wait season 2."
2376,"If you are a kid of the 80s (or not so a kid), this is definitely your series to watch. The aesthetic is similar to those brilliant adventure movies from the 80s like ET or the Goonies. As for the story, we could say it's a mix between The X Files, Poltergeist and ET (kind of). First of all, this is not a horror series, although you might get a scare once in a while, but is more of a thriller. Something strange is going on, and since the first second you might guess what is it, but you won't understand what really is it until about half of the season. The season consists only of 8 episodes, so it is easier to watch it in a row, as once you start watching one you won't be able to put it down until you are down; and I am talking from experience.Then we have the actors, all kids are brilliant in their characters, you really feel like flying with them on their bikes. As for the adults, Winona Ryder is back into action and what a way to come back!! She plays the stressed mother whose kid has gone missing, although at sometimes it looks like she is overacting, she is simply wonderful and makes us remember on why she was one of the best way down in the 90s. Do we hear a Golden Globe nomination? Maybe.Fantastic Netflix original work (finally!). Not a sequel, not a movie adaptation, but something original. Yes, influenced by Stephen King's works and that 80 style which makes us feel nostalgic, which might be one of the incentives to watch it, so please watch it, you won't regret it! Just stop what you are doing and go binge-watch it! It's only 8 hours, one Sunday are you are done! Go for it!"
2377,"The degree to which they recreated the style, tone and atmosphere of movies from the early 80s is incredible. Every detail - sets, clothes, props, music, etc. - is exact. I happened to watch The Terminator (the original, 1984) not long after, and you would literally think Stranger Things was made by the same people, in the same year (if you like Stranger Things and for some reason haven't seen The Terminator, watch it now). Throw that movie, Poltergeist, the Goonies, Stand By Me, the Breakfast Club, and numerous other movies from that time period into a blender, and you have Stranger Things.The story is interesting, and the acting is mostly very good. The only negative is that being an 8-part TV series (so far), the pacing drags at times. Some of the actions and events are illogical, and there are a few plot holes. The basic story is kind of standard sci-fi/horror, but it's done very well.Those are minor gripes. The longer format also allows it to cover a wider range of its influences. It's not perfect, but there are few TV shows or movies being made today that are better."
2378,"**I do not want to spoil this series for anyone so I've tried to keep spoilers out of this review.**I finished watching this series within two days. As it has been stated in many reviews this series is a love letter to 1980's Sci-fi and I believe taken inspiration from the director Spielberg and many of his movies. The series brings out the curiosity in the actors minds by allowing them follow conspiracies backed by scientific theories. The audience is drawn in as the series follows a linear approach to its story very easy to follow how ever the Duffer Brothers do know how to build tension without giving much away. The children's acting are second to none, they take the audience on this incredible journey taking you right back to 1980. Anyone who enjoys Sci-fi will appreciate Netflix's monster Mystery Stranger Things."
2379,"The Duffer Brothers have obviously learned their lessons well, delivering an engaging and highly entertaining first season in a somewhat overwrought genre.The usual shortcomings inherent to mystery-drama-thriller-science fiction, predictability and plausibility, are managed quite well here and generally overcome by stellar performances all around, (Winona Ryder and Millie Bobby Brown are standouts), big budget production values, and a storyline that never veers too far off target. Up to date Grimm fans might be scratching their heads a bit once The Monster is fully revealed, (Isn't that an Alp?), but that doesn't detract from the overall quality or enjoyability of Stranger Things. The real test for the Duffer Brothers will be season 2, when such inherent shortcomings can be more acute and difficult to manage. Especially when the first go around is so successful. Expectations will be high."
2380,"I'm in my early 40's and this series paid homage to 'literally' most of my top 20 movies from the 80's.It wasn't perfect, but it was dripping with so much awesome nostalgia I didn't care. It's also perfect for kids aged around 10 to 14 who love movies , and especially older movies. Well to that age group the 80's is old movies. Whereas Super 8 for example was made for a target audience of kids only important. I loved the cast as almost every character outshone themselves, watch this space for a least a couple of future mega stars! This series was great fun, especially to the age groups I've mentioned above. 9 out of 10 from me, can't wait for the 2nd season. ETA - I started episode 2 at midnight, and just finished episode 8 now (7am).I'm so tired I'm borderline delirious @_@"
2381,"***Contains Spoilers***Stranger Things is filled with everything you could want in a thriller. You've got the lovable goofball, the damsel in distress, the strong independent woman who don't need no man, the young love, a missing red-head, and of course Winona Ryder. So if you haven't seen it, definitely put aside like 8-10 hours and get on that.Set in the early 1980's, the show should bring back some nostalgia for those old enough to have been around during that time. Playing on the belief (and recent confirmation) of government funded experiments by the American's, Stranger Things does an excellent job of piecing together a thriller through eight Chapters, also known as episodes, which take you through the story of a sleepy town in Indiana. Leading to startling discoveries that if you weren't a child younger than 12, you wouldn't have believed it until you saw it.Even though science fiction TV has been extremely popular in the past, (i.e. Doctor Who, Star-Trek, etc.), I have always found it took me a season or two to really get into the story lines. Creating suspense through it's use of fictional horror and the classic dark rooms and night-time scenes, Stranger Things will definitely have you leaving the light on as you go bed for those with a softer disposition.The toothless wonder, Dustin Henderson, by far my favourite character with his perfectly timed dry wit and adorably cute smile. Played exquisitely by Gaten Matarazzo, he actually has no front teeth in real life, meaning his condition, cleidocranial dysplasia, was written into the show just for him. Why we haven't heard of him before is a mystery to me, fingers crossed we'll see him more often in the future, with or without teeth.Which brings me to my second favourite character. Even though she's really only in the first two episodes and we don't get to know her a lot, it does confuse me as to why she kept crossing my mind throughout the rest of the season...oh that's right, because no one was looking for her!!!Why was no one looking for Barb? I mean yes, the government looking officials planted her car at the bus stop to make it seem like it she had run away, but let's be just a tiny bit logical here. We have a Sheriff, with his own sad backstory, going out of his way, like seriously out of his way, to find the answer behind a little boy, Will's, disappearance. So why don't we see the same enthusiastic investigating for Barb's disappearance? Should I be going down a whole feministic, equality, gender double standards rant route here? Should we be looking at the clearly confusing parenting going on by Barb's parents? Why Was No One Looking For Barb? That question will forever haunt me, more so than the monster that comes out of walls in the dark.At least one person was looking for barb, and also stuck in a tricky love triangle at the same time. Nancy's got some game, I won't deny her that. Set-up to be the smart, pretty, shy girl, with her cape-less wonder side-kick, Missing Barb, by her side, Nancy appears to turn to the dark side, Anakin Skywalker style eventually finding her way back in order to help Will's older brother, Jonathan, find Will from the Shadow Realm. Oh, that's brand new information for you? Seriously dude, you need to watch it!!!Even though Nancy's story-line, goes up, down and all around, I am slightly disappointed with who she ends up with at the end. Yes, Steve turned out to be a big-haired jerk at the beginning but he did help defeat the monster in the end AND lets not forget he told his even jerkier friends to bugger off. I mean, he's certainly no Jonathan, who only believed you when you said that Barb had been taken, and not run away, by the monster that took Will that everyone else in the town was saying didn't exist. Nice work. You did good.Finally we come to Winona Ryder, portraying a desperate mother, that can, at times, be slightly annoying, but we forgive her because she's a desperate mother. She didn't even need to steal our hearts, because seeing her desperation and commitment to getting her son back, especially when she hear's his voice, makes you just want to lend her your heart. (See what I did there?)All in all, Stranger Things is a fantastic watch, thrilling right to the end scene and providing revelations that just make your hair stand on end. It even got me thinking a couple times throughout the season if things like this actually do happen and the cover up is just that good. I suppose we'll never know. It seems we all just need to wait for that day when we're called up from sitting at home on the couch watching TV and find it's our time to save the world from a terrifying monster that somehow manages to go unnoticed despite being massive, ugly and killing numerous people. Yep, that's the day we're all waiting for.With the Season Two trailer released earlier in the week, we can only hope that it lives up to its older brother and the hype that, probably won't be as big as Game of Thrones, but will no doubt be there just the same."
2382,"Stranger Things is not only Netflix's best till date but it is a tribute to the glorious 80s and one of the greatest series of this decade which will surely leave a huge impact on society.It's simply Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King. Everyone who is fan of Stephen works and movies like E.T. , Alien , jaws , Stand by me , the goonies , close encounters of third kind and many more will instantly develop a crush to it. First of all Duffer brothers captured the right nostalgia with their superb writing. Today every series try to run for higher audience and critical remarks. Stranger things not only success in these both but also leaves a major crush on it. The Characters are extremely lovable, the story , the twist , environment , atmosphere , story and all the elements including the horror factor makes it a unique tribute and a sort of remake which clearly stands out crystal clear from a crowd of bad remakes and sequels. Not only relating to films the story has both excitement and emotional facts at it center. Each character is immediately a classic whether it be Eleven , Barb or Dustin . The little hints that it contains and all those scenes that reminds us of the very famous films of late 70s and 80s are so so so so so good. To be Simply put there are many many series in Hollywood that are critically acclaimed and loved by audiences but very few have the rare factor that makes them stand out from the crowd to finish at the top and stranger things is one of them . no wonder why both Steven and Stephen are its huge fan.Also all the actors have done a great job which adds to the quality. All I can say is STRANGER THINGS IS DESTINED TO BE HAILED AS A CLASSIC"
2383,"Stranger Things came with a lot of hype that I had a hard time believing. A science fiction show with Winona Ryder as an unstable mother to a boy gone missing under very suspicious circumstances. Netflix hit this one out of the park. They took a piece of a bunch of the best movies (science fiction and otherwise) and threw pieces of them in adding a fairly complex plot as to how scientists accidentally ripped a whole between parallel universes and didn't know how to deal with it. They did a great job of having basically three groups (friends of the kid who went missing, older sister of one of the friends and older brother of boy who went missing, and the mom and sheriff) all working independently to start but with each episode coalescing into a single group fighting the government agency that screwed things up to begin with and the beast from the parallel universe that had stolen the boy (and others). The writing is excellent as they make it build such that it is one of those shows you start to stream and find you can't stop until it is over. Thrilled to see season 2. They did a great job of bringing closure to the first seasons story with a happy ending, but planting just enough seeds that it leaves little doubt there is room for incredible expansion of the story in seasons to come. Netflix is doing a great job with their own productions, but this one stands out to be a potential SciFi classic. Even Breaking Bad didn't leave me this enthused after one season and that is my favorite show of all time."
2384,"My wife and I watched this on Netflix streaming over 4 different viewing sessions, one or two episodes each time. Overall it is very entertaining although I don't share the lofty (9.2) IMDb rating.Set in the 1980s it appears to be inspired by ""The Montauk Project: Experiments in Time"" by Preston B. Nichols and Peter Moon, regarding supposed time travel experiments at the Montauk Air Force Base at the eastern tip of Long Island as part of the Montauk Project. A ""time tunnel"" was created and alien monsters traveled through it to menace the locals.Here Winona Ryder is Joyce Byers, single mother of two sons, one about 17 and the other about 11. A strange girl (Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven) shows up and the 4 young boys who are close friends take her in and hide her. It is clear that she is different and we find she has escaped from the top-secret experimental lab. She also has extra-normal powers.David Harbour is good as the local police chief Jim Hopper. He is instrumental in helping uncover all the secret activity and find Joyce's missing son.The movie contains lots of paranormal activity. When her son goes missing, we find into what they referred to as the ""upside down world"", Joyce is able to communicate with him through light flickers, even though she doesn't know where he is. he is actually very close to her but they can't see or hear each other directly.The ending sets it up for a continuation.Update September 2019: We dropped our Netflix subscription, I object to the heavy emphasis they put on what I consider ""trashy"" programming. So I was able to get season #2 on BluRay from my local library. My wife and I watched the first 3 episode and just weren't motivated to keep watching more. Not that it isn't good, for the right audience, we just no longer felt it was worth our attention and time, compared to all the other things we might want to watch. To us there was neither an interesting storyline or interesting characters to draw us in."
