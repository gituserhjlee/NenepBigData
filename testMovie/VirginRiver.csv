0,Not normally my kind of show.I always give them a shot though and this one pulled me in. Hope they make a second season.Me a 70 year old male who usually goes for the Fargo's and Breaking Bads of this world. A pleasant surprise.I do have a soft side.I did enjoy the Gilmore Girls.Had to keep that one quiet....
1,I really like this series and sincerely hope they don't take too long to release season 2. It's well acted and produced. It's light and romantic without being cheesy. I'm glad Netflix finally produced something heart warming like this. Looking forward to season 2!
2,"As a Hart of Dixie fan, I was a little worried based on some of the reviews. Turns out it was unfounded. The only similarities are that it happens to be based in a small town, the protagonist moves there to start over and the doctor is played by the same actor. It's a completely different story line, its dramatic and its darker. I'm happy I gave it a chance. You should too!"
3,"Not only is this show full of heartfelt emotions, it's clean for the entire family to watch. I love the characters, their stories and what each of them brings to the table. The acting is phenomenal, Mark did such a wonderful job portraying his emotions on his face, that was one of my favorite things. I binged this show in less than 24 hours and I'm already wanting to know about the next season. Fantastic all around.And yes, it has similarities to hart of Dixie but you have to get over it, this show is worth your time."
4,This show reminds me of Heart of Dixie. Of course with a few changes. Just started watching it so far I like what I'm watching! Give this show a chance a cute little gem!
5,"The characters, the romance, the story. Perfect. Netflix nailed this one, and I can't wait to see what happens next in this quirky little town. The book character adaptations are on point and the storylines are immersive. Thrilled to finally find a balance of drama and romance on the platform. Move over hallmark, you've got company."
6,"I didn't know there were books and I've never watched Heart of Dixie so I can't compare this to either like other viewers. But I just binge watched the entire first season on the strength of the chemistry between the two lead actors and I definitely want a season 2 since 1 ended on such a cliffhanger. Please keep making this show. It might be predictable and formulaic in the same ways so many things are these days, but it's no less addicting for that."
7,I've read most of the books from Robyn Carr and thrilled to watch the series. The characters are wonderful and I hope they come out with more seasons.
8,"Every episode recap for you here if you don't care to watch.The words said between Jack and Mel's constant flirting and loin-panting. Jack: I want you, only you. Mel. I think I'm falling in love with you.... Mel: I can't. I'm not ready (I really want you too though say my puppy eyes and lip biting) wait, no. I can't.....Hope is absolutely annoying in Season 2 (Ok, she was throat-punch annoying in Season 1, and now she is extra ick and I take her screentime moments to scroll TikToks.Charmaine - please go away, squat out the spawn and be gone already. There is a book called ""He's Just Not Into You"" please read it.Yet, I'm sitting here watching it, so, yah...."
9,"Didnt even know there were books. Never watched Hart of Dixie. And I love the show. Was hesitant at first because I had high hopes for V Wars, which is horrible, but was pleasantly, and happily, surprised with this show."
10,"During a recent illness, I was laid up for several weeks, and this was a pleasant, undemanding way of passing the time. It made zero demands on me. Annette O'Toole is always a pleasure to watch, even if her character is annoying. This is an actress who has never gotten the credit she deserves. The men are handsome in non-threatening ways. The heroine is pretty and smart, but not too pretty, and not too smart. It's like a Harlequin romance for TV.Two things bug me:
That's not Humboldt County. Trinity Alps, maybe, or somewhere in the Sierras. It rarely snows in Humboldt, and there are no snow capped mountains. Humboldt, especially the pot growing areas, is cool, foggy, and green. I lived there, and that ain't it.The other things is endemic to almost all TV and movies: the perfect hair and make up at all times. A woman spends the night in basically a hobo camp and the next morning her hair is smooth, glossy, and blow-dried, her eyeliner and mascara intact. lip gloss undisturbed. It's a pet peeve."
11,"I love love love this series. It has heart, complex human characters with none of the out there gratuitous subject matter that is so on trend these days, just steady solid storytelling without any cringe. I've cried and i've laughed and been so disappointed to reach the end of the season.
Absolutely great job from Netflix."
12,Just finished the 3 episode love the location this series is filmed. The actors are amazing. Hope is a hoot.
13,"I had high hopes for this series, and the first couple of episodes were promising. By the 5th episode, however, it was apparent that the writers were happy with churning drama out of the same old cliches we've seen a hundred times. Gun toting pot growers take the main character hostage to treat their injured leader? Really? While at the camp, a young woman just happens to be in active labor - breach birth, no less - so the heroine can save her as well? Really? I watched another episode, just to see if it improved. No such luck."
14,"Started off with a really interesting plot idea. I was hoping for something like a female POV Northern Exposure and instead I got Melrose Place in a small town. This was too easy to see where all the storylines were headed and none of them were original or interesting.I really like Alexandra Breckinridge but it was distracting how perfect she looked in every situation. Slept outside on a pot farm's couch? Gets drenched walking through a downpour? Perfect hair, perfect makeup every time.The flashback birth scene was awkward to watch. Dialogue stolen from a bad 80's sitcom. ""I want drugs!"", ""This is all your fault!"", ""I hate you!"" Ugh. Didn't even seem like the actors believed it.Made it through season 1. Will not be looking for season 2."
15,"Okay, so many people mention this is like 'Hart of Dixie', and reality is, it's not, Heart of Dixie is very much a 'teen-show' with adults, Virgin River is an adult show in a small-town(my comparison would be, it's Northern Exposure, combined with Providence, or Judging Amy, with a hint of Gilmore girls).
It's a very comprehensive dramedy, this show has real emotions, real drama, but also characters that can joke about life as it happens, and it all feels very natural, and real, be it very quirky.Like the header says, this show follows in Northern Exposure, Judging Amy, Providence, Men In Trees(better than most people remember), and so on, it's a small-town doctor-drama that is mature enough to actually be remembered, even as it has just started, needless to say, I can't wait for season 2."
16,"First things first. I admit there are similarities between this series and Heart of Dixie. (Let's ignore the coincidence of actresses.) The original story line of a medical professional moving from the big city to a rural American environment is the same. So is the initial conflict between the incumbent MD and the incomer. After that the two series diverge. This is a much grittier, deeper plot, with so many more sub-plots developing throughout the series. Yes, the environment is rural America, but it is less saccharine, sugar coated niceness and closer to real life. Watch it and enjoy."
17,"I'm glad it's back, but why does Charmaine have to be this annoying? This is too much. Sometimes I even gotta take a break because she can be so annoying."
18,"Medically accurate, great romantic chemistry, grows are a thing, and just realistic enough to escape reality for a while. Hope it is coming back. Develop the character of Jake beyond the military career."
19,"I couldn't stop rolling my eyes. She announces that they even have lattes in Kuala Lumpur and that she was there with Doctors without Borders. Seriously? It's a huge metropolitan city with skyscrapers and modern hospitals. Of course they have lattes. She says she worked 5 years as a Nurse Practitioner in a level 1 trauma ER, yet later, she's a Nurse Midwife. That makes zero sense. The crusty old doc suggests putting honey on the back y bottle nipple. A 72 year old physician is not from the dark ages. He would know the risk of infant botulism in a 3 week old is very real. He leaves the fact that a pregnant patient has protein in her urine out of her chart. Why? I'm struggling to get through the second episode. The characters are two-dimensional cliches and the storyline is as predictable as a Hallmark special."
20,I had to write another review because I just noticed the actor who plays the doctor is the same actor who played a doctor in the tv show Heart of Dixie! And the music reminds me of another great show This is Us! Love this show so far and I haven't even finished episode 1 yet! Thank you Netflix for renewing it for a second season!
21,"This show is a lot like Hart of Dixie, but darker and more annoying. It follows the same trope of a big city woman moving to work at a medical practice in a small town (and even the same actor plays the head doctor in both series). Romance and small town drama ensues. This series has all the ingredients that I typically love, but it misses the mark. A lot of the characters do nothing but shout and bicker, which is really stressful to watch. One of the main characters, Hope, is particularly stubborn and irritating. Some of the plot points are annoying too, and its seems like there would be other more interesting ways for the writers to create drama. There are also some very heavy topics addressed in the show, which seems like a lot for a show that is supposedly feel-good. Little things about this show bug me too, like you never see much of the small town, just the buildings separately, which I know makes it easier to film, but gives it less believably, charm, or context. Each episode ends on a cliffhanger, which makes you want to keep watching, and I've blown through almost the full first season."
22,"Amazing!!! I did watch al the episodes at ones.
Cant wait till season 2."
23,It's the kind of series that is good to watch while you're busy doing something else. It's predictable and cheesy.
24,How on earth did this show get a 7.7 rating? I'm pretty sure it's only on Netflix because Hallmark channel passed on it for being too sappy.
25,I love Virgin River but I am so annoyed with Charmaine in Season 2.
26,"It is for those whom like long winded series's about small UsA town communities, the storyline is very predictable so there is nothing unexpected in the end. They crammed most soap cliches in Season 1 so its hard to see how this story can develop into something memorable. The main characters are great actors, though i think the slow burning attraction should have been better developed over a few seasons, the rush killed the chemistry. Some of the supporting characters not just bad actors but downright annoying, so much so that we reached for the fast forward button."
27,"This is one of the hundreds of disposable melodramas that have littered the pop-culture viewing scene. Oodles of campy cliches exist in full swing, the grumpy old doctor resisting the younger, female progressive, the ex-marine bartender finding new footing with a business and aiding his former mates with jobs, the jealous girlfriend feeling threatened by the new gal and therefore becomes overly-possesive allowing an easier exit by the boyfriend, the campy music that lays a bed beneath the silly melodramas, etc. etc. A new twist is the existence of a bootlegging weed camp, full of the dregs and nastiness one might imagine in the luxury of middle-class writers workshop. Oh yes, and the hairdresser preens around with propped-up breasts, with exaggerated cleavage. And for such a small town I find it odd that the restaurant thrives and is full practically every night. The show is silly and beyond redemption."
28,Was recommended by friends so I've sat through 8 episodes waiting for it to get going. Only 2 left so it's probably too late. I guess if you like Hallmark channel and Mills and Boons you'll like this. Jack is hot. That's the only good bit.
29,"I've never read any of the books but having read some reviews I think I would be even more disappointed.First good thing. I thought the main actress was very good. I felt she was the strongest character and actor in the series.Second, the scenery is absolutely beautiful. Made me want to pack my bags for vacation to enjoy the gorgeous environment.Now for the things that I didn't like. Without giving too many details.First, is it just me, or does anyone else find it annoying that Jack is constantly inserting himself to follow Mel, show her around, or just be around Mel in general? He came off to me creepy and desperate. I've never watched a show where the lead male love interest was so unlikable.Second, I thought many of the characters throughout the story were unlikable. Even the main character, Mel, at times made me groan.Third, the plot was slow...I was hoping things would pick up but I was bored. I only finished the first season to give it a full chance but all in all it was weak."
30,"Lots of totally improbable plot twists, yet they are cheesily predictable. Bad actors running on horrible stereotypes and a solid dose of wholesome.The scenery is gorgeous, the actors pretty, but flat. It's a bit like a TV show from the '80s. If that is your sort of thing, it's very bingeable."
31,"The acting is good, the scenery is spectacular, but the writing is for YA viewers or Hallmark fans. Too bad."
32,"Love this show BUT they have to kill Charmaine off in childbirth. She is soooooo annoying! She has no claim to Jack yet she's acting like his wife or girlfriend. He needs to tell her to shut it! Her whining and complaining and neediness is majorly annoying and grating! It's not just that she's a problem for Jack and Mel it's that she's a problem for the show. She's just a major Beyotch!! She's complaining about him not being trustworthy when he does not owe her anything! He's showing up way more than he is obligated to and she's still being a major pain in the a@@! What a piece of work!Everyone else on this show is tolerable even though Connie, Muriel, Hope, Lizzie and occasionally Doc can grate on my nerves. Mel and Jack keep me interested. Their characters drive and carry the show. It is funny though how much drama this supposed quaint little charming town has. My husband watched 5 minutes with me and said ""Who knew a town that small could have so much going on?"" So while the show is good it does have a bit too much drama BUT I hope that they continue the show for more seasons to come unless they continue to give Charmaine too much screen time. If they don't cut her character back quite a bit I will have to stop watching because she has def ruined the vibe this season and that can't continue."
33,"Sometimes you just need a comforting watch, something that isn't trying to preach at you but is easy going and makes you feel good. This is exactly what this show is."
34,"From the first line of dialogue, this show reeks. Apparently no one producing this watched Northern Exposure. The local crumudegon, the ditzy daughter if the local crumudegon. The cabin that's a joke. None of it rings true."
35,"Your basic comfort home spun nothing too confronting series. No real effort require to watch it and ultimately all will turn out ok, eventually."
36,"I gave it two stars because a couple of the actors aren't egregiously bad and the scenery is beautiful, but this is very well-trod territory. Hackneyed characters talk in cliches and act in non-sensical ways. Three of the leads are OK, but the supporting actors come from the Pia Zadora Academy of Dramatic Arts. They recite their lines like Miss America discussing world peace.So many things don't add up. First there's the hunky bar owner. Apparently owning a business only involves wiping the bar, serving drinks and dropping everything to chauffeur our cute nurse practitioner. In his spare time, he is both Chip and Joanna Gaines, refurbishing and redecorating a run-down cabin, (fetching farmhouse-style, of course) for the cute nurse.It makes no sense that everybody loves a stubborn, ill-tempered busybody with a stupendous ability to hold a grudge, who happens to be the mayor but doesn't actually perform any mayoral duties. And does nobody call the police when a car is found abandoned with the occupants missing? Armed pot growers operate with impunity right across the river and nobody calls D.E.A.?This is a show written by and for people who know about small town life from the Hallmark Channel, but have never actually been to one themselves."
37,I have to say that I was very excited to watch the show because it is one of my favorite books. I was very upset with how they change the storyline. I think that they did a great job on the series as far as portraying some of the characters and it was good but it was not Virgin River. They tried to hard to spin It into a drama series. It was plenty dramatic as it was and I could see some enhancements but they took it way too far. I'm giving this a full reading because I would like to see it continued and maybe they will fix it
38,"Aside from the title and the character's names there is very little semblance to the Virgin River books. The casting of Jacks character was way off. Jack is a big guy over 6 feet tall with short military style hair. Everyone in the Netflix series seems to be taller than Jack including the teenager Rick. Melinda, who was told that she couldn't have children, was the one impregnated by Jack, not Charmaine, who was a minor character in the book. Doc and Hope were much older and not in a relationship. Preacher was described as a gentle giant who was somewhat introverted. Brady's story was the exact opposite of what was portrayed in the Netflix version. I could go on about the changes to the essence of the other characters, Connie, Muriel Sinclair, Jo Ellen etc. not to speak of the ones left out of the storyline, Jack's marine buddies whose stories were featured later on in the series. I understand that from books to screen some changes have to be made but they filmed a completely different story. Enjoyed the books but the Netflix version was disappointing."
39,One cliche after another. One stereotype after another. So much foreshadowing you'd have to be brain dead to not guess what's going to happen. Even worse than anything from hallmark.
40,Beautiful....what a story!!!! Give it a chance....
41,"Please hurry up and bring out season 2!At first I thought enough of the flash backs already but by the end of the season I want more. Easy to watch, story lines are great, characters are great."
42,"If your looking for hallmark type show this is it. Annette O'toole seriously destroys this show, what a terrible over-acting actress. Everything else is decent i guess, if not a snooze fest."
43,"This show was great! Haven't slept that great in awhile. Hard to find a show that's so boring it luls you right to sleep.
Happily though I've been on episode 4 for weeks because within seconds BAM! I'm out."
44,"With all the excellent television shows available, it's really too bad that Virgin River is so pedestrian. Shallow, 2 dimensional characters, simplistic, unrealistic dialog and trite situations combine to make this a real disappointment. The BC scenery is fantastic."
45,"This is the first TV show set in the Emerald Triangle in Northern California. While Virgin River is not a real place they do mention Fortuna, Garberville and Eureka which are all real towns set in the redwood forests along the California coastline. The series is about a woman who moves to the area after she had serious heartbreak in her private life. She works for an older doctor who doesn't give her the respect she deserves until she earns it. The program is about relationships between people. There is nothing political or otherwise repulsive about the story lines. Some of the characters are former military and there are people who moved to the area to hide from their past. Because there is so little to watch these days that isn't overtly political I find this series to be a nice change of pace."
46,I'm about half way through season 1 and love the show and am delighted to hear more seasons are coming but Hope's character is begging increasingly annoying. So much so that now I fast forward all her scenes.
47,Predictable plot....to the extremes.. but watchable with good actors..binge watching galore...
48,"As a fan of the books I loved this 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
The actors are great and I really hope they do a second and more seasons."
49,"Just unrealistic. Predictable to the max.
Had to stop at the second episode."
50,"I am a long time fan of the books, and upon hearing that there would be a Netflix series, I was a little weary that it wouldn't measure up.Boy, was I worried for nothing!The Netflix series is amazing! It's a fresh look with minor adjustments from the books. Things that I assumed would drive me crazy work out well and I really love that.I have two very minor issues with the show, but very very minorThe first issue is that a lot of characters have been given character flaws not in the books, but nothing too major and I understand that a TV series would need a few character flaws to account for character depth and bring extra friction so I'm good with it.The other issue is that a lot of the characters seen typecast from other shows. Need an ornery doctor with issues about people joining his practice? Grab the guy from Hart of Dixie. Need a soldier type with relationship issues? Grab the guy from Grey's Anatomy.Like I said, very minor issues, nothing that concerns me enough to change my rating.All in all, a great show that starts from the beginning so you don't need to have read the books first, but after watching the show, you're going to want to. 10/10"
51,"So this is Hart of Dixie with a nurse instead of a doctor and without the quirky, wonderful characters of Bluebell?"
52,"I could have written this, and I'm no writer. It makes day time soaps look academy award worthy. The plot centers around a sappy love story ending in heartbreak resulting in the female lead's need to run away to a small town where the hunky bar owner has obvious undiagnosed PTSD making them both ""broken"" and therefore perfect for each other. All of this ridiculousness is glued together by inane flashbacks whose placement make no sense and are always shown as the characters stare plaintively into the distance.Throw in the obnoxious wife of the town doctor, the town gossip, the beautiful townie willing to be the lead character's sexual doormat for years, the token black character, and just for fun add in illegal pot growers living off the grid willing to kill anyone who mess with them but are ok with free medical services from the Animal House doctor.The series is simply ridiculous and anyone with two brain cells can figure out the ending after the first 5 minutes. Basta."
53,"I am not normally into these Harlequin Romance type shows but I didn't realize that was what it was when I first started watching Season 1. I liked the characters and was happy when they announced Season 2.Is it me or is Hope's character less endearing and more annoying than Season 1? She and her ex (former ex?) kiss weird.The on/off between the two main characters, Jack & Mel (had to look her name up) is tiring.The constant whining of the pregnant lady is most annoying. Enough already. And it's a bit ridic that she would hang around this town so that the the new gf would be treating her.The domestic abuse throuple is over-the-top.Sadly, season 2 lost it's lustre and it's no longer the show I thought it was.The only thing that hasn't changed for me is I love that it's filmed in and around Squamish & the LM."
54,"I try to finnish the second episode, but I couldn't, it was too boring and not interesting."
55,So we start with a woman in distress and then have her rudely treated and patronised by each local man she meets (and she's the one who has to apologise) until it's the hot barman who wants to sleep with her. I'm sure if I give it a chance I'll 'fall in love' with the characters but if anyone treated me so poorly I wouldn't stick around and no-one else should. In short..this is a great example of women putting up with crap and it being romanticised on tv.
56,The background music sounds familiar. Did the producer of this show hire the same musicians from This Is Us?
57,The end of the first season was an enormous cliffhanger! I'm excited for the next season; hopefully it will be here very soon
58,"Giving this a 5 due to,mixed emotions over season.
Was excited for the continuation,but sadly those feelings left.
The stories felt weak,forced & unsure of direction.
Watched season one,twice due to story & character development.
This season characters kind of were annoying,even ones liked originally.
Season one had quirky & small town charm,with serious moments.
Unfortunately season two felt,like it was trying too hard & making the stories overdone.
Got sick of the Jack,Charmaine & baby parts.
With Mel & Jack it was like,just figure things out & move forward.
Hope for a season three to finish out any unresolved storylines,otherwise wasted my time.
Especially need closure with Doc,Jack & even Preacher.
The cinematography & music,although was done right."
59,"Watching season 2 after a year is like returning home to your old comforts! Only watched two episodes, so I can savour this season a little longer. Absolutely love this show and the cast."
60,I really enjoyed this show. Yes it does compare to Hart of Dixie which I also love but it's not the same. I love the acting in this show and Hope is hilarious. Charmaine is just annoying. Love Mel and Jack. I just hope there is a season 3 and it doesn't take as long as season 2 which has a huge huge cliffhanger. It's definitely worth watching...
61,I can't put into words how much I love this show. The scenery is beautiful. The story is wonderful. I love the characters. Certainly a feel good show worth watching. Watch it!! You won't regret it!
62,"Startet watching the show, then found the books. That was a bad moove...because the show is nothing like the books. The names are the same, the town is the same. Yes, you cant shoote a show or a movie just as the book reads, but you can get pretty close. And this is as far away from each other as can be....
How the romance between Mel and Jack starts, how it evolves. Not to mention Charmaine, who is a footnote in the first book.
The show is good, and i love it, but its nothing like the books.
Read the books, they are worth your time"
63,"The setting is beautiful. However, that's just about all I liked about this show. So many things don't make sense. It's winter but there are cicadas chirping and thunder storms. Mel likes running through the forest but not hiking. Hope is so awful, why does anyone even speak to her? I honestly don't like any of the characters. Maybe they're supposed to be ""real people"" but people who are this ""real"" don't have friends."
64,"Couldn't get through the first episode.Predictable, trope-laden, wooden, mindless junk.Perfect fodder for the viewer hooked on Hallmark schlock, however."
65,"I'm trying to enjoy this series because it's good to get some feel-good content on Netflix for once! But, damn, this is really a carbon copy of Hart or Dixie which I stopped watching halfway through the first season because it got a little to predictable.This storyline is progressing exactly the same, PLUS the ""old doctor"" in town is played by the same actor. Wow."
66,After four episodes I got bored. The plot doesn't move along fast enough and the characters all seem to be singing the same song
67,"I would have continued to watch this show if it wasn't for the inaccurate and damaging perspectives on social services, Adoption, foster parenting, etc. The perspective that all the characters take about a woman wanting better for her baby - questioning her mental health, denying this is her wish, claiming social services and foster care is harmful and the worst thing. I had to turn it off. I am saddened for birthmother a who have placed a child for adoption and have watched this. It also perpetuates negative and incorrect stigmas about foster care and social services"
68,"Bad acting, story and music. Would have been perfect for a soap opera. Netflix blew it on this unless they have algorhythm that says series like this are a hit with a big enough per centage of the population to make a few every year. Scenery was nice though."
69,"Don't bother, nothing new but a selfish main characters who found themselves in ""meh"" love story."
70,"I am a huge fan of Robyn Carr's books and reread the Virgin River series since I own it before the Netflix TV series debuted. I binge watched the whole first season yesterday, however the character names and some of their back stories resemble the book. The story has been so dramatically changed it hurt. I wasn't going to write a review but after sleeping on my thoughts I chose to put this in. I will continue to read Robyn's books because they are great stories with interesting twists and solid characters. Not sure if I will this series since I could barely see the only little glimpses of the original story. And the current plot is too overdone by script writers. Brady is now a good guy gone bad, Paige is too early in the story, Chloe's story was completely different. Melinda's back story is shifted and except being a widower is unrecognizable. And the duration of Jacks friendship/affair with Charmane is longer and going in a totally different direction."
71,I like small town series. But this one is bad.. no one is convincing enough and every character is a cliche! After two episodes I can predict the ending. I'm watching it just to laugh at the characters 😂
72,"All characters use the exact same canned lines like, ""I'll be right here. I'm not going anywhere."" No individual quirks or unique personalities. Just a lot of broken people with secrets and deflated spirits. Stereotypical small town concept of nosy and gossipy self-important nobodies disguised as good intentioned thoughtful friends. Oh puh-leeze.This was an easy show to watch and have as background noise. If watching, it helps to zip pass the many slow scenes. For instance, Mel's dating scenes: picnic by the lake, batting practice, dinner on the water, dance mingle, crying while driving, saying good night, etc. Ok, they like each other; we got it the first time.I hate the production style of repeatedly showing us flashbacks and nightmares. Once is enough. Plus, was it really necessary to waste time by dragging out the ""big reveal"" labelled as unexpected, when viewers already knew how it would end? And what's with the town mayor's crusty personality and running around like a chicken without a head?? She constantly pushed and alienated everyone and yet everyone still coddled her poor behavior and adored her. Martyrdom rules.Overall, this may be a show for those who love the books, but for the rest of us, it was boring and repetitive again and again, from episode to episode."
73,"I am very disappointed how the series started. Page, Brady already there. Hope isn't dressed frumpy and smoking, Doc isn't arthritisic riddled, Mel doesn't stay with the finches. Jack without military cut. Yes they are small things but it is what made this whole series special. Preachers personality isn't the way he's been described throughout the series. Small things matter."
74,"Just from the half of the first episode, you can tell this one is just a very obvious copy from Hart of Dixie.
I wonder if the people who wrote this just change a few little things, ""we need a blonde nurse instead of a brunette doctor, another small town with zero charming. A hot bartender, but wait, this bartender will wear a shirt. The grumpy old doctor, and the list goes on and on. Hart of Dixie had a very charismatic cast, I don't feel it with this series. My recommendation is that you go ahead and watch the original."
75,"I have not read any of the books that are the source material so I had no preconceived idea of characters, story arcs, etc. Was thoroughly enjoying the film even with the predictable path the story was taking. But who doesn't enjoy a bit of fluff? Even the strange spasms Annette O'Toole was making with her face was quirky rather than annoying.
HOWEVER (and here there be dragons... or spoilers) after devoting approx 7 hours to this film for the ending to go in such a direction was not only out of the blue, but very disappointing. It made no sense for Mel to suddenly decide to return to L.A. and run away from Jack in the last 2 minutes. Several previous reviews discussed how this story differs wildly from the books and I'm glad; I can't imagine an author splitting up the couple at the last moment after we have invested in them to get together."
76,Too predictable. It had so much potential and then it failed ...
77,I'm not sure how they were even allowed to make this show. It's Hart of Dixie with a Nurse instead of a Doctor. Come on Netflix you could do better than this! Complete Rip Off!
78,If you haven't seen Heart of Dixie or you've seen Heart of Dixie & haven't started watching this one yet there is no need to watch the other. The pretty much the same thing with the same old actor playing the same old doctor who doesn't want help from some young new doctor or NP or PA from the city. The only difference is this one is set in Northern California & Heart of Dixie was set in the deep south.
79,"I've watched 3 or 4 episodes so far. Bland writing. One-dimensional characters (especially Hope, who just runs around yelling at everyone and not in a charming way). Non-sensical plot elements (how often does a nurse-practitioner/certified midwife work as an Emergency Room nurse with criminals? And why would they hire someone who specializes in childbirth to help an aging doctor at a small town general practice?). There are a lot of things that make me wonder if the writers have ever met a nurse, been in a hospital, anything like that. Medical professionals don't ask you ""When are you due?"" They ask you how many weeks you are. And a midwife wouldn't be all ""let's call a specialist"" the second a baby doesn't take a bottle. I like some of the actors but the writing sucks so much.Also, this is just a remake of Hart of Dixie set in the PNW. Even the same actor playing the cranky doctor!"
80,"I am surprised netflix let this go........ it is so unoriginal, so cheesy, i could guess what will happen next, even what the characters will say in scren write next..... i couldnt even watch a full show just skipped to 10 minute next and next...... what a waste of time and money"
81,"A lot of reviews complain that this series is a copy of Hart of Dixie. It may be similar, but the series is based on a novel published in 2007. Hart of Dixie was produced in 2011 so who's copying whom?That said, this series is a cringefest with many gaping holes, a patchwork of nonsensical plot lines. The inattention to detail is inexcusable. Here's a town with one child, no police force, a mayor who should be in jail for meddling in other people's affairs, and a weepy heroine who garners no sympathy.Mistakes are rife: does a nurse practitioner sit in a hospital waiting room covered in blood, making no effort to get cleaned up? During a power outage from a thunderstorm, why is one person freezing while others gather at the local restaurant? Aren't thunderstorms warm weather events? If you don't know someone very well, do you really build her a house to keep her from leaving town? If there's a group of violent drug dealers nearby, who make a habit of threatening people with guns, do you protect them from the law and give them free medical care? When you pull out two glasses and a bottle of whiskey, and pour one glass, drink it, refill it and drink it again, never filling your companion's glass, haven't you forgotten something?And Hope, oh my, how does a busybody like that get elected mayor when even her friends kick her out of their bridge club?"
82,"Tim Matheson PLAYING THE DOCTOR IN BOTH : VIRGIN RIVER AND HARD OF DIXIE with our main character as the help he did not want and will grow to likethe main character moves into a small town into a house owned by the mayor of the town that is a far cry from what she was used to and the owner of the local bar is the romantic target for our female character DUDE THIS IS HART OF DIXIE and that show was fun and cool like WTF NO NEW IDEAS FOR A tv SHOW ?
HART OF DIXIE was more fun more happy and this one is more on the drama side but its the same god dam thingcopy paste HART OF DIXIE and take the fun out and put in some drama : result is called Virgin RIverepisode 1 effect was : to stop watching and go re-watch HART OF DIXIEps: ANNETTE O'TOOLE and LEXA DOIG got really screwed by this tv show as they are the only true actors in this XEROX copy of HART OF DIXIE a show that had great actors and is not the case with VIRGIN RIVERthis is way i am giving it just one star"
83,"I tried hard to like this show cause I really liked the main chick in her role of The Walking Dead. But it's pretty cliche, predictable and painful. Eek sorry I tried!"
84,"Good series, good actors except for the older woman that plays Hope her acting is so over the top and not believeable. She ruins the show whenever she walkson set."
85,"It is a good show the characters seem to blend in well small town living, beautiful scenery, living in a small town I can relate to how everyone knows everyone"
86,I watched the entire show (2 seasons) in less than 3 days. Loved it! Can't wait for season 3.
87,"This is really best Drama and Romantic Love Story series. This series touch to my heart.
No one believe that I watched all of episode of season 1 & 2 in just one day.
If you will watch this Vergin River then this will touch to your heart."
88,"What a masterpiece of love story or love stories you can say.Watched both seasons in one go,can't stop watching.Amazing place of shoot,amazing love story,amazing songs between that will make you feel more connected.Maturity makes series skyrocked.Can't wait to watch season 3,4,5......
LOVE IS IN THE AIR."
89,We really enjoyed the first series but had to give up on the second after episode 3. The characters became incredibly annoying and the whole program seemed like a soap.
90,"We were excited that finally there was a season 2. We had enjoyed the first season and settled in for a good time. But, sadly, the show has settled into mediocrity. The worst is that each scene was so predictable based on wat came before. Just a ho hum soap opera with wooden performances. The secon show, second season is the last for us. I already know what's coming next."
91,Watched all ten episodes at once...fantastic adaption with a classic cliffhanger ending. If Netflix does not renew this for season 3 there will likely be a revolt!
92,"I have just two words: ""Doc Hollywood"". We knew where that plot was going, too. Big city principle character is hired as a nurse practitioner to assist, against his will, a cantankerous small-town (Virgin River) doctor who bucks heads with her at every opportunity. She's given a cabin to stay in, busy-body old ladies are swirling about, to help and to interfere, and of course there's a convenient opposite-sex-attraction who owns the only bar/restaurant, and who just happens to be the only single in town, and gorgeous. Surprise."
93,"Absolutely unoriginal, predictable, and corny. Watch hart of Dixie instead."
94,Cute and pretty. Seen this before. Formulaic to a fault. Let's find a fresh premise please!
95,"I worry that the folks who have rated This Netflix Original so highly might be suffering from some sort of severe head trauma. Perhaps when the swelling subsides they'll return to their senses.
If I had to guess, I'd say Virgin River was penned by either a Bangalore-based customer service mill or the same AI that Reuters uses to robotically concoct business stories. There's nothing nothing nothing there.
I've made it through a number of episodes (under duress) and have yet to come across a relatable character, convincing dialog or anything that smacks of human insight, humor or wit.
I'm holding out hope that season 1 is a precursor to some community-wide disaster (derailment of a freight train loaded with toxic chemicals or perhaps a Sokovia-esque lift-and-plummet).
Another possibility is that the town of Virgin River is the much duller, more stupid community a few miles down the road from David Lynch's Twin Peaks, and that at some point Hope and the Log Lady will meet and discover they're related.
Mingle!"
96,"I thought this series is written in the 80's,...so predictable, dramatic only for the sake of it. Even my mom (80+) was laughing at the plot. Not the characters, not the plot and definitely not the drama is convincing or interesting."
97,"I didn't read the book(s), and haven't seen Hart of Dixie, so can't compare to those. I had hopes of this being a fun binge watch, and the more I watched, the worse it got. The director seems to think that long wistful looks between characters, or having actors gaze into the distance with a moody look will make them more complex, but actually it just drags. And the simplistic characters are almost cartoonish, and defy feeling any interest in their actions and story. There is a reliance of the plot device of flashbacks, attempting to create interest and tension by gradually revealing ""secrets"" from the characters' past leading up to their present woefullness, but as the stories are revealed, there is no real surprise, just more predictable and saccharine soap-opera-ish twists (hard to call them twists, when they are so predictable).Waste of time."
98,"I know most book to movie/show adaptations are not spot on, nor do I expect them to be. But this one is so far off it's turned me off the show.First off I was very hopeful, I liked Mel, and grumpy Doc. Everything seemed to be going well until hope sent Mel walking to Jacks and I saw just how large and busy Jacks bar was. This is supposed to be a small 600 person town with NO CELL SERVICE.In the book: Mel is intent to get tight out of town to go to Colorado and live her sister. But the baby stops her.In the show: But the baby doesn't come right away and Mel intent to STAY instead of GO, is sent to stay at the grabby husbands house, instead of staying at Docs because Doc is more than grumpy, he's a downright bad.When the baby does come, Mel names the baby Chloe because of a dead sister instead of because her and her husband had planned to name their daughter that. Why would you need to change that?! Then the town hates her because she wants to call CPS, when Doc is supposed to be the one that ""does"" that.In the book: This town loves Mel. That is a reason she struggles with wanting to leave. She becomes fast friends with Connie and several others.In the show: Paige and Christopher are already there and running a breakfast truck?! This doesn't happen until book 2! And what breakfast truck?!And Preacher is not the sweet but rarely spoken and slightly scary cook. Preacher is one of my favorite characters! None of this makes any sense. I'm only on the 2nd episode. Good grief.I stopped watching when Mel asks Jack about his parents and he says he's close with his mom but he doesn't get along with his dad!!!In the book: Jacks mom is no longer alive, but Sam Sheridan is a force and a very important character we hear from often as holidays and visits occur on the regular.My mind is blown that they have done such a disservice to these books. I'm surprised Robyn Carr has allowed them to pick apart her stories how they have. I'm sad and I'm done watching at only episode 4."
99,"I've read the entire series of Virgin River.The adaptation is fairly decent. It's a little strange to get so many POV's when the first two books were based on Jack and Mel and so many of the other events happened much later.Alas, this is a TV series. I am enjoying it. but I find myself a little bored and they've really turned this into a Lifetime channel show and removed the adult content and gritty emotions the book offered.If the show gets another season, I hope they get a better stride on the true essence of the books and not this fluffy Lifetime version."
100,"Really sad material and overall feel, and basically the whole thing is the older doctor and mayor yelling at each other the whole time. Wasn't fun to watch."
101,"Virgin River is an unrelentingly dismal storyline with really good actors cast as truly unlikable characters. Main character Mel's past is peeled away like a big yellow neon onion--there to make you to cry with all the subtlety of sledgehammer, maudlin, weepy, and wishy washy, and Hope is from the first scene a bitter, deeply disturbed woman who gets worse and more ugly a personality as the series continues. Only Jack is complex and honestly believable, never whiny, and an exception because Tim Matheson is typecast as the grouchy old small town doc we've seen before. The weak characters have dimension but it is written with an unsophisticated, melodramatic, and heavy handed pen. Were there ever a glimmer of a light moment in this whole series the review would better, but this series is a slow slog from one trauma drama to another, one bar scene with breaking dishes to another, and ultimately from one bitter woman to another weepy, wimpy one."
102,"If the shows Hart of Dixie and Men In Trees had a baby...it would be Virgin River. Stunning landscapes, small town charm, quirky interesting characters, and chemistry between the leads. Definitely one I hope get a few more seasons."
103,"Its watchable but not without skipping parts of it, am reminded of how horrible O'Toole is as an actress and honestly she never could act, get tired of the constant bickering from the doctor and his wife O'toole wish some pot grower would cap her character."
104,"This low-budget, unoriginal, predictable drama is supposed to be set in Humbolt County, but where it's shot looks nothing like Northern California."
105,"Is it amazing? No
Is it horrible? No
Is it meh and entertaining? YesThis reminds me of the daytime soaps in that you get sucked into multiple stories going on at the same time. And each of the stories are bordering on ludicrous. You would think that the writers get their ideas from soaps and just incorporate it to a small town in california.But still, it is entertaining and worth a watch."
106,"Well, first of all this is a total rip off from Heart of Dixie, so the screenwriters can me commended for their originality.
But apart from that it's a nice story. The atmosphere is amazing and all the actors are just amazing. Really good actor.
EXPECT the main character. First of all she always styled from head to toe. You can see the make-up on her face trying to make her look younger and her hair looks like she just left the hairdresser every time. Why do all series do this nowadays. It looks so fake. What ever happened to reality?
But the worst part is that the whole town is being extremely nice to hear but she always has a dissatisfied look on her face. It makes her extremely unlikable and I'm pretty sure the makers and trying to make her look sympathetic but it's not working.
Always the same emotionless expressing and sometimes she can draw out a slight fake smile.
With another lead role actress this could be one of the best series of the year in this genre.
Unfortunately she looks bored, too old, too styled and without any emotion. And it's boring..."
107,"Honestly, I've seen it all. And will definitely watch the next season.
It's really bad. Bad acting, bad dialogue. Just bad.But I've bingewatched out of this show and can't stop."
108,"I never comment on series here, but I just had to warn people about this crap. Don't waste your time, it's an unbelievable stupid, boring, predictable and unimaginative show, basically it's a Hallmark-y soap opera that pretends being serious drama. I almost can't believe that Netflix have produced such a bad TV show and really hope it won't be renewed for second season."
109,As a fan of the book series I found this adaptation to have too many changes. A few changes is one thing but changing the first book almost entirely is another. I would have enjoyed this so much more if I hadn't read the books first.
110,"Even when Mel is camping, just woke up, in the worst possible conditions, she is always in perfect makeup. This drives me crazy. She even wears lipstick when she wakes up in the middle of the night. not needed."
111,The first episode felt like it was plagiarized from Hart of Dixie. Even the doctor was played by the same character. Very boring and expected plot.
112,"Only watched the opening scene tonight. 1. Anyone that cannot drive at night with a truck tailgating them without freaaking out should not drive at night. 2. Voluntarily crashing into the side of the road and landing in a ditch. See number one.
Opening a new show with so many stupid cliches does not portend well for the rest of the writing. And 3. The cantankerous old dude in a pickup come to the rescue, co cell service, and potentially slow tow truck service are three more cliches. In the first frreaking five minutes,"
113,"BRIck BREELAND is the doctor protagonist.. come on! If you are going to do a VERY similar story, at least choose different characters. It's a fun plot... at BREELAND as the protagonist, it ruins the whole story. He'd be awesome if he had played a different character:"
114,This series is so basic and simple minded that it's almost watchable. In fact I've managed to go through it all.
115,Have been trying to work out why I already know what's going to happen. Researching when it first aired and what channel. Got me completely confused thinking I was imagining things. Same story as Dixie and Hart. I guess I can stop watching now!
116,Hello Hart of Dixie for the next generation. Disappointing.
117,"Watching a cast of older actors with a mix of unheard of's and wanna be's needs a far better script. So far ever cliche in Hollywoodland has been included. The sets are good, the scenery bountiful, but let's hope the writers up their game. This needs a bit of a curve to work for a broader audience."
118,"I sure hope so. This unfortunately turned out to be one of those series that starts out terrific, then slowly dies. I'm usually quite picky about what series I watch, so I was happily surprised after watching the first two episodes of Virgin River. It seemed great, with so much potential. But then, as said, the initial exciting rush of something new and also terrific dies down, and then the episodes became predictable and at best, boring and worst, really annoying.One of the things that annoyed me was the character of Doctor McCrae, in particular that he was supposed to be 70 which would make him a baby boomer, in the same generation as me, yet he has the values and likes and dislikes of someone from our parents' generation. As if he's thinking of someone else as old, the way he did as a child. Someone who likes Fred Astaire, and has the values of the 1940's.
Also, at the beginning of the show he was always crotchety, rigid, and generally obnoxious. But by episode 3 or so, he had softened and the original qualities were all but gone.Another annoyance was the character of Hope, especially in the final episode of Season 1. As difficult as it is to imagine anyone being as clueless as she was, it was even more difficult to believe that the victims of her selfish behavior were not more angry. Sure, Jack was annoyed, and Mel was upset, but I think most people would, like me, express much more anger.Another thing was the scene at the Mingling Dance. When Mel's sister Joey and Brady were attracted to each other, talking and obviously enjoying each other, everyone stepped in and were angry, doing whatever they could to separate Brady and Joey and lay a big guilt trip on them. I thought, what is this, 1950? So what that those two liked and even wanted each other? Watching the others' reactions you'd think the couple had been planning a heist or a murder. And as if the sixties, seventies and beyond, never happened.Finally, the predictability. Here's my prediction, after watching the final episode: Charmaine will have her baby, then something will happen to Charmaine, leaving the baby without a mother. Jack will step up as the father, and then, Mel, who can't have children (which was never explained), will get back with Jack and she will be Jack's baby's mother. I'll be very surprised if there isn't some version of this.As other reviewers have said, perhaps the best feature of this show is the scenery. The location is gorgeous and a pleasure to view on TV. Hopefully, the second season will prove to have a little more depth and reality than the first."
119,"Since the novel Virgin River was written more than 20 years ago, the plot of this TV show is not a copycat of any other TV series.As a huge fan of the Virgin River books, I hated how this production portrayed the characters I love and created new ones that did not belong.Viewers who are not familiar with the books may enjoy this version of the story, but I can't imagine why anyone would mess with perfection."
120,"So many plots, I watched the series until the end, but I was getting bored waiting for some of the plots to be resolved. I liked the main female character, Mel's acting ability. She was the best in the whole series, although a bit too schmaltzy at times. The character, Hope -- I was getting fed up with her getting involved in everyone's lives. I had never seen her acting, so wasn't familiar with her as an actress, but I'm not impressed. She pursed her lips a lot, and that was not flattering. And to find out her character was married to Tim Matheson's character was a surprise. Oh well, I guess I've vented enough. I'm not interested in the next series, if it's going to be a long drawn out soap opera, that's all I can call this movie, a soap opera. I quit watching soap operas when I was in college. Too boring."
121,"I love that it's like Hart if Dixie, but unfortunately it's not as good.alexandra can't act to save her life - her acting is really bad.
The other characters are not likeable really.The town and countryside are pretty, though.Disclaimer: only a few episodes in."
122,"I liked most of the actors but I think most of the events are predictable, you know who's going to have a fight against to and what's the outcome will be. The execution of the scenes are forced, not naturally delivered.Hope is supposed to be the Mayor but I've never seen her done any ""Mayor"" jobs/roles apart from hiring Mel. She's just running around the town meddling with personal issues with other characters. I feel like the creators could have done better for her.Can't wait to see the next season and see if any improvements will come out."
123,"The saccharine sweetness might annoy you, the fact that no one ever swears or kisses with any kind of passion or even tongues make it very 'safe'. A pair of sisters a few years apart in childhood are obviously not as adults, with older sister's plastic surgery not quite defying gravity. But this is California, everyone has 'work' done, right? All of the soundtrack is acoustic ballads used for one thing only, to shamelessly pull on those heartstrings.
But...I watched it all. Absolutely not my thing, but the Netflix fresh offerings are getting thin on the ground. I got hooked, by a soap?!
It had a magic feel. Set in an idyllic off grid small town where everyone knows everyone else (apart from the ton of extras passing through the bar). Even the local weed growers have good manners and show a modicum of respect, most of the time. I was surprised that they didn't all go to church every Sunday, I haven't even seen a priest yet, which seems like the only cliche missing so far.
I couldn't help thinking of Little House On The Prairie, and I liked that as a kid.
If you want something to watch with Grandma that won't bore you to distraction, this is a good choice, no need to hover a finger over the remote, it's safe."
124,"Martin Henderson very cool masculine.
Tim matheson and Annette O'Toole are so predictable. They keep saying the same things over and over. Don't get involved in other peoples lives he says. She says but I'm only trying to help. I mean over and over.So the only word I can think of for this show is hackneyed. Also perhaps cliche .But the scenery is beautiful and if you want to waste a couple of hours they should do it for you"
125,"First off, the story is supposedly based in a small town in Northern California. One look at the gorgeous exterior shots it's OBVIOUS it is NOT Northern California but in fact British Columbia and is the first indication what is about to follow is, at best, questionable.I watched the entire Season 1. Tiresome is the first word that comes to mind. The overriding very thin plot line appears to be the continued discord amongst all of the characters. The plot line is contrived and obvious and feeds the ever present ""formula based film making"" continually being forced upon viewers of American TV and movies. Bombastically hitting viewers in the head with the OBVIOUS story line even without having read a single page of the books. It's sophomoric and insulting.The Doc and the Mayor are OBVIOUSLY in a estranged relationship later confirmed as married but living separately. Really, figured that one out during their first conversation.Charmagne turning up pregnant after she breaks up with Jack... oh come on WAAAY to transparent. We could ALL see that one coming even before he read the letter. I like her. Her's the only genuine character in the entire blood thing.Preacher is a bit of a self-righteous who conducts himself like the busy body Mayor. We are supposed to sympathize with Jack suffering PTSD but castigate Brady (the screw up) for dealing with the same issue while trying to assimilating back into society.Mel's sister Jo is a hot mess and her situation only muddles the story line and is totally unnecessary.Bottom line this is a failed cross between Northern Exposure and Doc Martin with out any of the humor. Which makes it a total bore. I don't need to be hit over the head with the obvious plot directions. It insults everyone's intelligence. With so much really good programing coming out these days, this one is just to simplistic. I won't seek out Season Two."
126,The plot is lame. The acting is worse and the so called medicine portrayed would kill people.
127,"How do the producers of this show get away with such a blatantly shameless rip off of ""Hart of Dixie""?"
128,I have read these books through at least twice. I was encouraged by the actors chosen to play key roles but after watching the series I was disappointed in the spins that took place that were so out of bounds from the books. Charmaine being the most disturbing as a lead character and storyline. Doc and Hope?? Where did that come from. Paige with a bakery truck? A menu and waitstaff at Jack's? Didn't happen. And the cabin...in the first episode it's within walking distance?? Ricky's grandma out of town. This was supposed to be a small town...didn't they look at the map? I wonder if the writers understood or even read the books.
129,Elderly housewives might enjoy this cliché-ridden series. So... a well deserved 3 stars out of ten.
130,"The script, acting and production values are better than Hallmark, but similar formula and like Hallmark filmed in beautiful BC. It's a chick series, the scripts were written from romance novels. Started out interesting and different but it's one of those series that didn't need 10 episodes, 6 would have been more than enough. Too many flashbacks, they were very confusing. Seems like everything happens at Jack's Bar, boring. Romance is an alternative genre for people who are tired of sci-fi, horror, sit-com, crime, action-adventure...TV series."
131,"I hear this is based on a book. So perhaps my complaints are with the book. However, this didn't work for me. The story centers around a nurse from LA who accepts a job as a nurse in rural California (you didn't know there was such a thing, did you). The older solo doctor is aging and someone has to take over the practice. He is also very adverse to assistance and stubborn for no real reason. Ok so let's stop here.. haven't I seen this story before? Yes, yes I have. It was on a show Hart of Dixie. And shockingly they even hired the same actor from Hart of Dixie to play the same character in this series. But in Hart... it made more sense because they had a doctor to take over from another doctor. How is a nurse going to take over from a doctor? Plus in Hart the lead character had 1/2 the practice but here the nurse only works for the doctor... well, I kind of agree with the doctor that she needs to do what he says.Melinda Monroe (great name) is the main character. Despite being a nurse, she has designer purses, a BMW, and is beauty queen beautiful. Of course, she immediately runs into the rakish rogue... Jack Sheridan who runs the local bar (of course right next to her house) and he isn't married and is very interested. Too interested for me to deal with. In the first episode alone they are together the entire time.People compare this to Hallmark and that is very true, but Hallmark is not known for excellence, just mediocre. And that is what this is. If you are bored and can't get anything to load on Netflix, it will pass the time. Otherwise, skip it."
132,"I have not read the books and agree with others that some characters are stereotypical or unlikeable.But have found it to be an addictive absorbing romance-drama (with a mystery subplot.)Lots of chemistry between the two main characters Mel (Alexandra Breckenridge) and Jack (Martin Henderson) and I think a genuineness that is rarely seen on American tv these days.
Mel's character is upbeat, intelligent and sensible. (Too often in such shows, writers seem to equate strength with nastiness, whining and consumerism)
Jack (ex-Marine and owner of a pub) is intense and insightful - an ideal romance hero.
Colin Lawrence (Preacher) is a real stand-out - he deserves starring roles, a show of his own!!!Tim Matheson and Annette O'Toole are talented actors, but unfortunately, their characters here - Doc Mullins and Hope - are mostly curmudgeons.Great scenery, the food looks good and Mel has some really nice sweaters.Hope there will be a Season 3."
133,"The setting is lovely but this is so cheesy. Corny music, storylines and characters. Nothing out of the ordinary at all, feels like a film you stumble across on a Sunday afternoon on an unheard of channel. Also agree with the other reviews that all the characters are miserable, it would have more appeal if it was a nice setting with nice characters, none of them are likeable particularly the doctor who is just rude."
134,This is literally the exact same as Hart of Dixie 😂 it's so weird to watch. They even have the same guy playing the doctor of the town like... can they not make a show on their own 🙄
135,"I've watched both seasons and I really loved it. It's good acting, good characters and engaging enough plots. Can't wait for the next season now!"
136,"TBH there is not much wrong with this show, the location is stunning, the acting is good and the characters are fairly likeable - but this is a show aimed squarely at the girls though who are no doubt the ones scoring this higher but I thought giving it a low mark would be a bit unfair. From a blokes perspective, it's the usual concoction of not much happening and and endless storyline of ""will she/he won't she/he"" with not really that much else happening - full of cliché's and a run of the mill drama that's a bit like watching a made-for-TV movie. I would give it a 6 or 7 but its probably a 9 or 10 when viewed from a female perspective, so down the middle it is."
137,"The only similarities to the book series is the charachter names. If you look at it as a completely different entity it's not a bad show, is it the best drama? No. Is it the worst? No. Enjoyable but I think the books are better, the show is a little all over the place. Doc and Hope as a couple takes a bit of getting used too and they take up far too much screen time in my humble opinion."
138,I like the series. Nice dynamics between characters. I just find it unfortunate that the series doesn't stay true to the books.
139,This is a show that more people need to watch. The storyline is great and I hope this show lasts for a long time!
140,"Flicking thro Netflix . Chanced on Virgin River . So pleased we did . It's a warm cosy series ,some quirky characters,acted by some good actors. The episodes blend nicely, giving you more background on each character. The added bonus is the beautiful scenery,it's amazing , oh to visit it . Looking forward to the new series. Hope you enjoy this series . Bruce"
141,"I really loved this show, so much so I downloaded the books. It's a light and easy watch.
However after reading the first book I was disappointed they'd changed many elements and back stories of the characters, which makes me wonder how they take this forward. Only time will tell, but if they'd stuck with the books we'd have got a few years worth of episodes.
I'm now on book 16, only a few more left!The only similarity with Hart of Dixie is a female medical person moved to a small town from a big city, and the town doctor is played by the same actor. Other than that the storylines are completely different."
142,"Wonderful feel good charming series about a 'big shot' nurse moving from LA to come to a small town called Virgin River to help the local but ageing sole town doctor.Lots of great sub plots about the towns people and her settling into her position. The location is stunning, the characters are spot on and overall this is a great - very well done (go Netflix) charming drama series that both me and my partner (both avid thriller / horror fans) absolutely loved.It's nothing like Hart of Dixie which i thought wasn't overly good, too flimsy and unrealistic. This is much better. Definitely recommend for a feel good series."
143,I can only imagine Annette O'Toole suffered a horrible case of indigestion from chewing all that scenery.
144,"I think that the plot is interesting yet has been done before. (Although many people are saying this show is just copying Hart of Dixie, Virgin River is based on a book from 2007 and Hart of Dixie was made in 2011.) I do feel that the show is a little boring, but I enjoyed it."
145,"I am a nurse. I live in the Pacific northwest, close to Vancouver, which is where this is filmed. It looks like Vancouver, not California, but that's ok. I like forests. I really wanted to like this show, and I did like the story, and some of the actors are really fine to look at. But oh my gosh, it is soooooooooooo slow and redundant, and the medical scenes are so laughable.
First, how slow this is! This first season could have been cut down to 2-3 episodes. The flashbacks showed fractions of the same scenes over and over. So predictable and silly. The relationship between the mayor and doc is totally unbelievable.Any time I watch a medical show, I am bound to see things that are not realistic, and most actors put the ear pieces of their stethoscopes in backwards, but at least they put them in. When Mel listened to the baby's lungs, the stethoscope was still around her neck!!!! ha ha ha. Then she listened to someone's heart on the right side of the person's chest. I mean, come on.Still, the scenery was nice, and the story is interesting, but let's speed it along. I found myself fast forwarding many times."
146,"Had never heard of the book or show, stumbled upon it on long weekend while house sitting. Absolutely loved this show can't wait til season 2. Personally not familiar with these actors or storyline from other shows as others have mentioned in reviews. Also not disappointed that there weren't more ""gritty"" scenes as someone else mentioned. I think good balance of realness and intensity. Thanks Netflix."
147,"I just wanted to say I love the simplicity and decency of these kind of shows in today's increasingly immoral world, predictable yes but it left a huge impact on me, I connected with show and loved every minute of it."
148,Can't wait for season 2. I may or may not have watched the entire first season in one day. 😳
149,Have every book by this author and loved this series in particular. You get to know the neighbourhood and its citizen. I actually signed up for Netflix just because of this show. There are changes from the books....and it is a little less passionate shall we say. But I loved it! Binge watched the whole thing friday night! My only regret? I don't want to wait too long for season 2.
150,"Loved the series, will there be a season 2? Can't wait to see if Mel really leaves. So many great characters."
151,Amazing sweet soothing romantic drama with pleasant environment. Must watch..A stress buster
152,"No character development, no interesting unique issues or point of view. You can miss 20 min of the show and still nothing important happens. The best case is you'll forget about it once you turn it off. Regret wasting my time. The only one thing that was good is amazing lanscapes."
153,Really captures the essences of the series. The selection of cast really adds depth to the characters.
154,"I enjoyed Virgin River. I have watched and loved Hart of Dixie; and although it can look like it's a similar premise at first glance, Virgin River is a story of its own.I really like how the main character is portrayed. She's a strong, smart, and independent woman, and yet also very loving and caring. I think the story is very realistic, and I can relate to the characters in a fundamental level.Yes, it's not grand like some of the TV shows out there, but I think that's where the charm is in. I quite like the seemingly mundane and predictable storyline -- mostly because I feel like it was executed really well. The details and subtlety created a very believable story."
155,"Acting is ok, storyline is sooo predictable. Script made me want to laugh and throw up, in moments that we're trying to be serious. I'm sure if you're into Hallmark movies then you'll love it, but I can't do another minute of this nonsense. (Only made it through one episode)."
156,"Really enjoyed the show then toward the end we wonder off into night time soap opera land. Predictable story line, predictable character responses and were off to the races. Results: One less viewer."
157,"Even though this is a series, it screams Hallmark movie. I don't know why I keep watching. It's truly so basic."
158,"The show itself is not bad at all! The acting is not bad, but I can't help to think how similar this show is to hart of Dixie. I mean come on they used the same actor as the doctor"
159,"The actors are great. There is good chemistry between all of the players. But...I gave up watching soap operas years ago because no one was ever allowed to be happy longer than one episode! As I get further into this series, I am finding the same thing. People finally get together and lo and behold some tragedy develops to keep them apart. I'm hooked but I don't like it, and doubt I will watch a second season."
160,"It's good to see Martin Henderson, I think he's a brilliant actor and plays his part well
Breckenridge reminds me too much of a younger Debra Messing , and is no match for Henderson's talent
This is pure soap opera, at every turn a new crisis , some fine supporting cast ,
and a few good location shots"
161,"I don't watch a lot of TV but this was one thing I was so looking forward to. I've read all the books in the series of course and am a fan of Robyn Carr's other books, I think I've read most of what she's written. As it's been such a long time since I read the Virgin River series I toyed with re-reading them but decided against it because I know that in the transfer from book to screen things get changed. And yes, things did get changed. On the plus side I liked the main cast, although Hope was a bit OTT for me. What I disliked the most was the lack of passion, the Virgin River series is some 20-odd LOVE STORIES but as this ended I didn't feel a warm glow I just felt disappointed. I'm going to re-read the first book now just to remind myself what a good series the books are and decide whether I'll be watching when Season 2 airs."
162,What a great story with so much opportunity to go in many different directions. Great choice in actors/actresses! I predict this will be a hit series that goes a long way with viewers!
163,I don't usually binge watch anything but I found this show compelling. Can't wait for season 2.
164,"Great scenery,cast & storylines.
Can't wait for,season two."
165,"This show is like candy, addictive, and I just couldn't stop binging this series."
166,"This series must be written either by a female team or male-sissies.
Im very emancipated i think, but the utter overload of too much understanding male's and completely 'going-emotional-without-any-restrain' females makes this nice little story sometimes unwatchable to me.If there would have been sexe-balance is this nice little story, the old stubborn lady would have had serious spanking by her husband, would have been kicked out of Jack's bar.And so on and so on. The whole village is packed with women in distress and men helplessly following them and not understanding them like they live in the 19th century.Al the women in the show are so overly 'understood' by the men, that most of the show is ranting around their typical female 'i-feel-so-much-lets-discuss-it-a- tenth-time', before talking it over an eleventh time with tea? Sugar?This show is the female version of a story about a group of guys in the jungle with serious behavour issues, leaving no one, including themselfs, alive, because they lack a women to counter-balance their male energy.This series misses real men and is stuck with losers who take women too seriously."
167,"Lots of potential here. Watching it mostly for its beautiful location, the mayor is a great, fun character, however the lead female- I like strong women- but she comes across a little too strident. Who struts in and starts telling her boss what to do in an over bold manner. This is a bit of a turn off, I lose sympathy for her and her sister is a very thin whiny character. The bar owner is great to watch... so hopefully it gets better -haven't given up yet."
168,"I love US, don't get me wrong (I lived for years in Boston or Seattle), but I am Canadian and I spent most of my life in Vancouver, where this series is (also) filmed.I simply don't get, don't people know where Canada or Vancouver are on the map? If you constantly watch on your screen our beautiful mountains, and waterfalls, and lakes, why pretending each and every time it's somewhere else in the world?!"
169,"I have tried to enjoy the Netflix series Virgin River, but it is very different from the original book. I expected differences as it is an adaptation, what I didn't anticipate is that the characters and the basis of the town and people's would vary so much. Military service is up front and a much more vital part of the book. The character of the lead Jack and his family, is not even close and a very important missing piece in the series. Doc and Hope are not related and considerably older in the book. These change make it hard for the book lover to enjoy the series."
170,"We read all the books, loved them all. This series was very enjoyable. We binge watched. Cant wait for new ones."
171,"Every episode ends in a ""cliff-hanger"" that is completely predictable every time. Some of the acting is good, some is just terrible. Some characters are likeable, some are absolutely irritating (I.e. the town's 70 year old mayor that genuinely acts like a 5 year old child for 10 straight episodes). Easy to watch if you are bored and want some background noise."
172,"I love the series 😍. Don't want to include spoilers in my review, but this is the first ever show I finished in one sitting. I have plan to watch it again with my wife, she is going to love this."
173,I was looking to watch something with heart and soul and found virgin river now I'm hooked
174,Hurry back! Our family cannot wait to see what is next! We feel like we are right there with this PERFECT cast 😍☺💞
175,Amazing writing and acting. We're going to have a hard time waiting for the next season! Please reward us with more of the same.
176,Really enjoyed watching the episodes. It pulls you in within watching the first 15 minutes. Love the flashbacks the characters have of their past lives. It feels like you are a part of their story and lives! Just wonderful. Can't wait for season 2!
177,Refreshing. Good family values. Great actors. I am deeply impressed with their. acting. Neflix should produce more family oriented programs.
178,"Terrible terrible stereotypes, but loved every minute of it! Location is wonderful, main actress sooo beautiful, if you liked Hart of Dixie you are going to enjoy this, too. Binged it in 2 days! I am excited for Season 2."
179,"So glad I stumbled upon this little gem. It wasn't what I was expecting, it was so much more. The actors/actresses are fantastic. Can't wait for season 2!"
180,"When I saw the preview for this show, I was skeptical. While it's a really melodramatic storyline for the two main characters with her sad background and his PTSD, the character development over the first ten episodes is phenomenal. I was hooked about midway through the first season and can't wait for season two. While the storyline of big city gal moving to small town to start over and meeting a handsome guy who shows her the perks of nowhere town seems so overdone, this is a fresh telling. Give it a chance - you'll love all of the side stories and their characters just as much as the the main story arc."
181,"This is my newest favorite show. I had no expectations going in and it blew me away. I really hope Season 2 comes out soon. The cast is phenomenal, the storytelling is enduring and captivating. I love this town, it's people and can't wait for more!"
182,"This series rolls along and pulls you in. Yes it is pretty predictable however in this era of violent films, filled with profanities, it is a refreshing change. One negative for me is Hope, the Mayor. She is the most infuriating person I have ever seen and that spoiled it a bit for me."
183,Im a stay at home mom and dont watch series because of lack of time but i have stayed up several nights watching this show its funny romantic keeps u intrigued i love it so much
184,"It's Hart of Dixie, but with a better story that doesn't rely on booger humor, and infinitely better acting. I've only seen half the season, but that's enough to know that this show is what Hart of Dixie should have been, and will be much more enjoyable after the first 4 episodes (unlike Hart of Dixie)."
185,"Actually something my husband and I are watching together. We binged watched the entire first season in two days. Hope Netflix has a season two. Reminded me a little of Heart of Dixie, but on a more serious note with several plot lines going on all at once. Love the show!"
186,One of those shows that pulls you into all the characters. The scenery is breath taking with every episode. The great and talented cast pulls into the characters with out giving to much of the story lines away. It's binge worthy so ready for the next season
187,"My wife and I had just finished watching the entire series of ""Longmire"" and ""Anne With An E"" and, feeling somewhat lost and bereft, we stumbled upon this show and decided to watch it.I could go on for many paragraphs on the problems we had with this show but in summary: Incredibly predictable storylines; stereotypical, one-dimensional characters, and high-school-play quality dialogue.The worst thing about this show were the laughably unbelievable situations that surpassed one's ability to suspend disbelief. In particular, the entire setting of the show in a small ""lumberjack""mountain town in rural Northern California that also happened to be able to support a cool Portland-style artisan baking truck and a perennially packed local bar that served up gourmet-level fare. I have been to rural Northern California mountain towns and you are lucky if you can get a cheeseburger on stale bread most of the time.Only reason I can surmise that this show had enough good ratings to be renewed is COVID-19. My theory is that people were stuck indoors and were hungry for new content. I will say that the cinematography was very good and the outdoor scenes were often beautiful but guess what -- it was all shot in British Columbia! The Coastal Range of Northern California is nowhere near as breathtaking."
188,"Stay with it beyond episode 2. It got a lot better Episodes 3-10. It has a great, slow vibe and the acting is really good."
189,"Really enjoy this show. No crazy storylines just a good story, great, complex characters and actors with good chemistry. Really like the depth to the characters and looking forward to seeing how they evolve."
190,"Hallmark channel all the way. Annoying characters, disappointing story line. Predictable."
191,"I binged this in less than 24 hrs.
It had me laughing, crying and yelling at the tv when the the end of episode 10 came.
The storyline's are immersive, the acting and chemistry between the cast is fantastic and the scenic backdrop, beautiful.Congratulations Netflix, cast and crew on such a great job."
192,"I am so hooked. I can't wait for the next season. This show is just over the top sweet to watch. I pray that the writers don't go off the cliff, stupid. The banter, the cast, the emotions, and a love story I hope will come to be. It is do worth you watching."
193,"Sure, many elements of Virgin River have been played out in many productions, but these are the key elements of life itself: overcoming tragedy with the support of others. We learn that all the characters have had to overcome troubles, but they do so with each other and perhaps for each other. I do think the flashback scenes could be incorporated more smoothly, but they serve the purpose. The setting is beautiful, albeit cliche, and the characters are unique. I appreciate that the series is not dark and twisted, as so many series have been in recent years. It is straightforward storytelling, interesting and perhaps a bit cathartic. Would be glad to see another season."
194,Basically a romance novel/soap opera set in a fictional Humboldt County town. Cliche characters. Pretty scenery. Good enough for killing time during Covid stay home. Biggest problem with the show is the picture of small town workings. I live in a small No Cal town so find lots of things off the mark. Log trucks do not drive at night. And log truck drivers are the best mannered folks on the road. The errors start from the beginning. There is a long list. Start with no California Natives in the cast. Humboldt and Siskiyou have several native groups. The sheriff's office for Humboldt is large. There is more than one sheriff in the county. No fog.....if you know the area that's weird. No animals....even weirder. There are eagles one scene but nothing after that. None of these people own dogs and that is a major error. No bears in the dumpster. Definitely the sanitized version of small town life in the mountains.
195,"The first series was pleasant with simple story and characters, easy watching. The second series was a bit far fetched with a man in his mid 40s putting his pregnant partner in a house with someone who hates her whilst he is having it away with the nurse, and he is the good guy (supposedly) :). The second series of theses characters and a thin story was a bit much for me. Shame they didn't give Preacher and Paige's story more time as it was the only interesting story in series 2."
196,I absolutely love this series. Great story line and the characters are perfect! Everyone needs to give this a try. It can be suspenseful at times and gentle at others. It drew me in immediately. Definitely a great binge worthy series during this tough pandemic time. Mel and Jack helps you forget the troubles our world is facing in these difficult times.
197,"Please, please, please!!
This show needs to have the old classic 24 episodes for each season!"
198,"Kind of a mix between Dr Quinn Medicine Woman and Grey's Anatomy (with much less sex.) Mel, Jack, Preacher and even ornery Doc are good characters. But Hope McCrea is like the Jar Jar Binks of this show. She is, without a doubt, one of the worst, most annoying characters I've ever seen on any show EVER. I'd give it a higher rating if she left."
199,Good series and cant stop looking at alex's face real reason i watched it and the series turned out to be great.. hope there will be a seashgon 3
200,Every one in this show has a sob story and all of them wallow in self pity. Annette O'Toole must have been sucking on a lemon the whole time and created one of the most annoying characters in tv history. Jim Carrey couldn't make as many scary faces as Hope. Terrible writing but great landscape.
201,"The show was really well done, very heavy and emotional but I love it. It's the perfect checks slick but unpredictable."
202,Complex well rounded characters with lots of drama. Definitely worth the watch.
203,"This is perfect for a Saturday afternoon binge. Everyone is kind in their intent, sweet story line, no deaths, pretty people. I've seen season 1 three times. Quarantine's been rough but this has been a welcome respite from all the real life drama we've been through. Looking forward to season 2"
204,"I love this serie can't wait to see season 2
i recommend everybody to see this serie"
205,"So I wasn't expecting much from this series but thought I would give it a go............ it's soooo good.
You know those good old Christmas movies, girl runs away from family to start a new life in a small (amazing) American town.... you know the rest. This is it, rolled into a series.
Easy watching but you just have to keep watching to see if boy and girl end up together!!!
Loved the first series from start to finish and can't wait for the next"
206,"10/24/2020 As the end of season one wound down there was nothing earth shattering that. The entire series was just an average soap opera type series, minus any drama or excitement. Everybody and I do mean ""EVERYBODY"" is a ""Goody-Two-Shoes"". Overly sappy, totally unrealistic with always being nicey nice. Even the kidnapping druggie pot growers appeared happy as they release their kidnap victims without any harm. We call that b.s. fantasy = ""NOT even close to being Real""/the proverbial ""Big Load"". I've not been invested in this candy sweet series at any point while watching it because it lacks viewer stimulation based on reality. Plus it's a whiter-than-rice series with the exception of one token black guy. And in the second season the writers involve him in serious crime. Go figure? The entire cast is dull and lifeless. Bon Appetit'
2nd season - Again, so sappy and unrealistic it made my neighbors dog cry. In the bedroom S-E-X scenes I kept waiting to hear John Boy say goodnight to Mary Ellen with floating angels overhead. Why do I continue to watch it??? Because I'm waiting for all of them to contract syphilis, overdose from shooting up fentanyl or having several hundred drug cartel Mexicans move into their town and force them all at gunpoint down into that Virgin River where they all drown. That's what I call a ""Happy Ending""."
207,"If you are looking to escape, this is a great show with wonderful actors. Love the small town feel in the wilderness."
208,"Just loved this series.
Clean, easygoing, emotions, values of human life, people in this town are very kind hearted, decent acting.
Each character is lovely.
Really waiting to watch next series soon."
209,"Anybody else who is a small town girl at heart will adore this show as much as I did. It's cheesy, romantic, funny, dreamy and to me perfect in every possible way. More please!"
210,"Feels like a Hallmark movie, but actually good! It has a sweet and feel-good atmosphere, while still tackling hard topics. The characters feel well-rounded, so I hope in the future they won't mess that up! I'm totally invested in the story and it is worth giving a watch."
211,"I started watching this show one day when I was bored and honestly didn't expect much out of it. I spent the first show thinking it was odd that Tim Matheson plays a curmudgeon of a doctor that doesn't like the female who is forced into his practice in both this show and Heart of Dixie. I rolled my eyes and figured it was a ripoff, but kept watching. I'm 10 episodes in and have become attached to the main characters and really like them. Jack and Mel are really good together, even as friends. They both come with lots of baggage, but have such likable qualities. I'm looking forward to seeing where the storyline takes them. Honestly though, Annette O'Toole's character has made me consider giving it up because I really can't stand the character. How can any one person be that annoying and stick her nose into so many things at one time? I'm hoping she gets written out somehow because the rest of the characters are pretty realistic and believable, but she is just horrible. Fingers crossed that she isn't in the next season."
212,"Lmao, even the old grumpy doctor is the same actor."
213,"We literally played a game in which we guessed what would happen next because it was so predictable. Also, why are there so many flashbacks!!?? Also I don't think nurse practitioners are that skilled in the 196820 different weird situations the characters get into"
214,"Netflix recommended this show for me to watch after I watched Hart of Dixie. Unfortunately this show is a very poor knock off of Hart of Dixie. City girl moves to small town and doesn't plan on staying, but ends up staying and falling in love blah blah blah. They even have the same actor play a similar role in both shows. Don't waste your time watching this boring show. Instead go watch Hart of Dixie."
215,"This show is ideal to throw on while scrolling, putting makeup on, remolding and organizing your room, brushing your dogs, or whatever tasks you may find yourself doing while hanging out. That being said, don't expect to not become invested in the storylines. The series is well thought out, although simple and cheesy, but heartfelt. Imagine if Lifetime actually put effort into their productions, it would be something along the lines of this. It moves fast so its not as if you're being dragged along. Well acted by the entire cast giving it likable characters. I love seen in other reviews it was originally a book series? I have no comparison in regards to that. But if you're looking for an easy, comforting show to occupy sometime with, try Virgin River out. If you don't like it within the first 20 minutes, you'll know and you can turn it off. However, if you give it a chance, it doesn't disappoint."
216,"The show is really well done but at pretty much every corner some character becomes still and in trance while reminiscing some past traumatic experience. Its always while another character is trying to talk to them,they all seem to be desperate for a nurse moving into town...a psychologist would be a better investment"
217,"I've seen a lot of reviews referencing Hart of Dixie, which I've seen, so have no point of comparison. To me, this screams a retelling of Northern Exposure! Replace Mel with Joel, Jack with Maggie, and Virgin River California with Cicely Alaska, and presto, Northern Exposure.
Now just because I'm drawing this comparison doesn't mean I don't like the show. I liked Northern Exposure a lot, and the same applies to Virgin River."
218,"I watched this show because so many reviews said it reminded them of Hart of Dixie, which I love. This show has an almost similar plot. Healthcare professional leaves the city to a small town and works with an angry doctor who wants the practice all to himself (actually played by the same actor, doctor for both shows). It's hard to figure out what this show is going for. Is it a serious drama? Or a lighthearted, small-town nostalgia show? Nothing ever adds up. We don't see the town. We don't really know the characters. They give us NOTHING to truly relate to any of them. So why should we wait all season to find out one characters dark secret when nothing gave us a reason to care? The characters don't connect. There's no chemistry between the love interests but told there is..... there's so much telling in this show but no showing.I tried to stick out to the end because only 10 episodes and on netflix. By 4th episode, I just couldnt waste any more time on this.Too many of the town people we are supposed to care about come off more as crackheads. I feel like whenever wrote this, has never stepped foot in a small town and just wrote what they heard and overly emphasized the two key factors.I already mentioned not seeing the town. We have the dr office, the bar, and that's it. A scene maybe somewhere else but always close up you can't see the background. Oh but we do get many shots of the same part of the river way too long. Not sure who was in charge of directing or if it was the writer. But damn. No. And I love many of the actors in here in every other project but idk about this show."
219,"This is like a daytime soap. Every character seems to have a secret, but when the secret is discovered, I think ""is that it? Why should I care?"" I have no affection for any character as they are all self absorbed about their past. Let it go.So why am I ploughing through every episode? That is the secret ingredient of this show"
220,"Have only watched a few episodes, but I totally got sucked into it. I love Martin Henderson, I think he's an amazing actor. Love the story, I like how flashbacks tell us about their pasts and how slowly we get to know these characters. Mel's character is very likable and relatable. Am curious to find out what happens to her."
221,"Just getting into this series. Great story. I hope that it stays clean. Makes me glad that I kept NETFLIX.
Well rounded characters. Widowhood, veterans, small business, community, justice, kindness, pro-woman, pro-man, pro-child, pro-furry friends.
I like this!
Thanks!"
222,"I was so surprised by this series. I was a big fan of Hart of Dixie and didn't understand why they would make something so similar again so soon. It put me off watching it. I finally gave it a shot and discovered it is absolutely nothing like Hart of Dixie. I don't know why they produced a trailer that does not do justice to the depth of the series. It did take me two episodes to get into the characters but once I did I was hooked. So glad to see it is back from another season. I loved Hart of Dixie for its totally lack of reality and escapism and I love this show for completely the opposite reasons. It feels very grounded and 'real' to me, I think they are handling many of lifes struggles in a very authentic and sensitive way. Episode 3 had me tearing up but there was nothing corny or melodramatic about it. I'd recommend trying the first two episodes to see if it's for you."
223,"I thought I was in the twilight zone while watching the first episode because of how similar it was to 'Hart of Dixie'. A lot of people already said it though, it's similar at first glance but the story lines and actors are deeper, HoD actually reminds me more of nighttime soap for younger adults.
I love how the show evenly spread out multiple characters stories, I found it boring when shows only concentrated on just a handful of characters.
VR's characters had their own story lines, but it wasn't overwhelming like some shows that give to much story lines in a short time.
To add, it's a perfect mix of good recognizable actors and new faces!"
224,"This is an amazing show! The plot is super predictable but the series is still great as you can deeply feel the emotions of the characters. Beautiful presentation of people relationships, with the good and the bad. The landscape views are breathtaking too. Overall, fabulous!"
225,"I don't usually write reviews but I want Netflix to know that this a great show! Easy to watch, good character development, good mystery. It's a pretty simple show, but if you like romances, you're in for a treat! The acting is very good...same with dialogue. Quirky characters. I binged on it for two days straight! The only thing I'm disappointed about is that I have to wait for Season!"
226,"Great story, about life and love, in a stunning setting. You grow to love the characters I so hope they make another series"
227,This is the greatest since The Hart of Dixie!! I like the series that flows like a continued movie and not a sitcom type show!! This has excellent plot!! The actors/actresses rock!! Thank you Netflix!!
228,"This show is far too cheesy, predictable, and uninteresting to warrant any kind of recommendation outside of rolling background noise while you are occupied with other more worthwhile things. Really. The characters are very one dimensional in a text book cliche romance novel kind of way. The storylines are expected. It is hard too imagine anyone finding this series captivating over the age of 13 year old teen girl."
229,"I wasn't sure what I would get when I started watching this show... Wow. I can't even begin...I cried abt 15 times -which I generally do not look for while watching shows or movies...BUT this show. Omg srsly I. Love. This. Show. All the characters r fantastic, but the main character, Mel, my God she just nailed this part. She makes me FEEL her pain, her strength...it's a very deep, emotional journey you go on with her and she brings you along for the ride immediately captivating you. So very well portrayed on her part. Its kind of a mystery/drama/romance that plays out for you in such a beautiful heartbreaking way, several love stories played out in intriguing ways, a story abt second chances at life and love, the end of a relationship(s), new beginnings... abt having an amazing strength and courage and putting those pieces of a broken heart back together. Abt how sometimes you find urself right where u were meant to be .... Now for season 2!!!!! I CANT WAIT!!!!"
230,"I read a few other reviews that said it's nothing like Hart of Dixie. Umm...it's identical, right down to the doctor that doesn't want to share his practice with a female. There were even a few lines from the first episode that were lines spoken by the doctor in HOD. City gal loses a man (although in this show he dies, not dumps her) and brings her big city wardrobe and attitude to small town, USA. It's a cheesy rip-off of HOD, I don't care what anyone says."
231,"I am absolutely in love with this series. The casting & writing is brilliant and it's so easy to fall in love with the characters. In this day and age it's so refreshing to watch such a heartwarming series. It's a feel good show but not cheesy at all. It hits all the right notes; laughter, tears, drama and romance. I cannot wait for season 2 and sincerely hope that this show gets renewed for season 3 too. I can't wait to see what happens in Mel and Jack's life. Well done Netflix!"
232,"This was a show that I just could not stop watching, the chemistry of the love interests were much different than a younger cheesy movie, and I liked that. Two adults just knowing and acknowledging an attraction.
Scenery was beautiful, romantic and shot very well. The medical portion was right on, and I appreciated the uphill battle of the doctor and nurse.
More pls!"
233,"First episode gave some hope for something similar to my beloved Northern exposure but I was wrong. This is not a smart and funny show. Rather predictable, boring and plot is slow and weak. Everything is too perfect, make up, actors..."
234,"Absolutely loved the show.. got hooked from episode 1!! Would definitely recommend to watch it!
The only thing that was disappointing was the ending, they could of thought of something different.. lets just say i was left fuming when it came to an end."
235,"So far so good, almost exactly same story plot as heart of Dixie so far."
236,"It's a nice piece of romance. Despite on I did not like the main characters (Mel is a leech, Jack is painfully boring and cliché) it still worked. Preacher and Paige were my favs."
237,Thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. Go watch it. I personally can't wait for the third season.
238,"Finally a series that has all the elements making Virgin River a must watch! Such a well put together story line, with great casting, real characters with great chemistry! I fell in love myself. I previously only knew two of the actors, but now have been introduced to so many more, and I love them all!! Such a hit. After Netflix canceled Bloodline, ( which I loved) I haven't binged on anything up until now! Please give us faithful viewers, that are dying for more, at least another season or two! Or more if possible!!!"
239,"Cute show, LOVED the scenery & the ambiance. Easy going rom-com with a cozy feel of small town life, with a slice of dramady of course."
240,Little miss perfect who thinks she knows everyone and can fix everyone's problems.
241,"First off- there are so many stereotypes.
Jack saying ""I didn't know city girls could drink whiskey"" I mean, really?
All the country people using metaphors constantly, the older man treating a woman like she's incompetent, the vet with PTSD and alcohol abuse, which, somehow never becomes a problem or makes him lash out?
Honestly I'm surprised no one has talked about how annoying jack actually is. He never actually gave Charmaine closure in their breakup he just gave his full attention to this new woman in town and then treats Charmaine like he couldn't care less about her?? I mean come on that's kind of a jerk move even if he did say he never wanted anything serious. And he somehow has sooo much time to manage a business and then do everything humanly possible for Mel? Then when Charmaine tries to get him to admit to his feelings he just stands mouth gaping like an idiot and avoids everything. I don't even understand what Mel has going for her other than doing her job as a doctor. It seems like Jack only chases after her because she's ""mysterious"" with all her trauma.
Also - The pot growers are also so random and I forget that it's part of the plot until they randomly show up."
242,"The first season was well written, but season 2 went off the rails. It is beyond annoying. Watching the drama unfold between all the characters is like being a chaperone at a middle school dance. It is that ridiculous. If you want to watch season 2 because you want to find out if Mel and Jack get together, then just watch episode 10 and you'll know. But, I can save you the trouble and tell you yes, they have a sex romp and profess their love for one another. Then, in season 2's crap fest fashion, tragedy strikes literally 20 minutes after. Insert BIG eye roll..."
243,My first impression was that all the characters talk to each other so rudely. It got so annoying I stopped watching before the first episode was over. Did anyone else notice? Does that get better?
244,"Season 1 was great ...did you get new writers for Season 2...looks like a 16 year old wrote it...
Petty,jealousy, impetuous decisions, actions and reactions...seriously looks like all the characters lost their brains in Season 2....."
245,"This has to be the most pathetic TV series I have watched in a long time.There is suggestion of a romance... and, derr, it eventuates.There's a bad scene that has to work out perfectly for the main characters, and it does.This is the most predictable crap I have watched in a long time.I kept watching in the hope it would get better and less predictable - this is like watching The Bold And The Beautiful.If you watch this, make sure you are doing the ironing or the dishes at the same time.Netflix should be ashamed!"
246,"Like many I didnt think this was my kind of show. I am a fellow filmmaker and appreciate the typical tv series production of Virgin River reminding one of watching cable. Yet at times it aims to delve outside of the innocent storyline which from my view should not have a place in the show, and its is only there because its a Netflix Production at the end of the day wanting all ages to watch and it just cant stay in its lane. Nevertheless its a fun watch."
247,Second season not as good. There was a little bit more comedic storylines in the first season. This season seems to be dark and gloomy there was a catastrophe happening every other episode. Nothing positive except for docs relationship with his wife
248,"Just finished watching this and very pleased to hear there will be a Season 2. Martin Henderson is great and I love the main story, but also really enjoy the Doc/Hope storyline! Really well acted. Feels very down to earth, genuine and relatable. Very touching
and poignant at times. As has been mentioned, hair and makeup is always perfect when waking up in the morning etc. which is funny but pretty minor issue. Overall very enjoyable show."
249,I really enjoyed the series. Something of everything. A feel-good series. Can't wait for the second season. Keep it up!
250,"I see the post in netflix and I relief, but the each episode I feel a relax sensation. I recommend ."
251,Love this. I've watched it 3 times now and could easily watch it again. A very easy watch. Can't wait for season 2.
252,A wonderful story. Can't wait for season 2. It is a very beautifully scripted series. Both the lead actors were amazing.
253,"As a comedy and her naivety jogging with stylish hair, walks by the river with expensive bags is quite fun. I don't mind the show, it is home to me so watching our scenery is an awesome reminder of how beautiful my back yard is."
254,Couple things. I found this to be pretty decent if u like chic flick stuff. I'm not a huge Martin Henderson fan so I was a bit off put at how fast he fell for mel. Literally at first glance but hey whatever it happens I guess. Annette's character was quite over the top and wish that could've been toned down a tad. After mel and jack get kidnapped by the pot people i fast fwd'd any scene that had one of those people in it. It did absolutely nothing for me regarding the storyline (but again that's me.) I too noticed the similarities between this and hart of Dixie but for those complaining I looked it up and the books came first :-/
255,"Journey of adulthood can be troubling when one cant let it go!
Your business is your business, kind of attitude is sometime we need before poking and probing people to share their stories.
All characters have a troubling past and this place seems like a recluse.
Community bonding- pros and cons both are shown in this show.
good watch"
256,"Very similar plot line, with some differences, that unfold in a more adult, less ""teen drama"" sort of way. It's got a nice simplicity to it that keeps me watching. When I need something more mellow, this is a good series to come to."
257,"If you want to watch a fill good, light hearted ROMMANTIC drama. Then Virgin river is the latest series to watch on Netflix. Loved the series and the lead characters. Waiting for season 2😎"
258,"I'm only on the second episode and already I'm hooked! I love the soft low key feeling and the interesting storyline. I'm starting bing watching at once, happy that there will be a season two."
259,"When the nurse is relating to the death of her parents, she states that she lost her mother at eleven and her father at ten. Then she gives details on her mother's death, that her sister and father entered the room while she ran away. The father should have been dead the year before!!!"
260,"I started watching this show with the hope that I had found a good non-aggressive, non-violent, emotional and familiar kind of show. But I hate when shows do not take themselves seriously, make mistakes, and plots are highly unrealistic.For instance, the plot of the growers (episode 5 I think) it is really hard to believe: from the set up, to the way they (specially a California girl) behaves in such a stress situation.... Come on, she's just a nurse, not McGyver!! And why cars have California registration plates when they are in NC...???? Ok, I get that Mel's car might be from California, but Jack's and the grower's.And the newborn babies? No way, a baby looks like that just out of the womb.Please, more attention to detail."
261,Why would someone as intelligent as Mel actually go for a jerk like Jack after the way he treated Charmaine. It ruins the whole show for me.
262,"OK similarities to Hart of Dixie1. The doctor who plays the doctor. Tim Matheson.
2. Medical love/drama small townEND OF.This is more of a drama love story with some dark moments as well. Its about love and friends lost, it has dark moments with threatening behaviour in the guise of drug growers, and sinister man who threatens one of the residents life.I loved this show and watched in over the weekend. I am really glad there is a season 2. The actors are brilliant and well loved from other shows.This is NOT a girly series it can be enjoyed by man and women. Its sad too and made me cry but also i had chuckle moments too.The scenery is breathtaking and boy I would love to go on holiday there.Give it a go, but Hart of Dixie it is not, which was different a comedy light and fluffy not like this at all."
263,"It to me a couple episodes to get attached to these characters but now I'm hooked. As the episodes provide more of the back story on the main characters you begin to understand how they each arrived at this point in time. As one of the characters says 'life is about the collection of everybody's choices""."
264,Did not read the books...thoroughly enjoyed! A nice surprise when I came across this series. Binged in one day (a sweet story). Looking forward to a season 2.
265,I ran up on this show unexpectedly and thank God that I did!! I am soooooo in love with these characters and the storyline.The soundtrack alone makes me want to be in love!
266,"Fantastic Series! It was clean, had a great story line and the characters are wonderful! Loved how the series brought all the characters together. Also the protrayal of small town living was delightful. Excited for Season 2."
267,"Let's make a show with left over bits from other 2nd rate shows with quirky characters, set it in a beautiful location a la Northern Exposure and try make city people wish they lived the simple life in a stress free world.
POOR POOR POOR"
268,"Trite! Poorly written! Poorly acted! Whoever liked it needs to get a life. Made the mistake of giving it a chance w the second episode. The setting, however, was impressive."
269,"This is supposed to be in Humboldt County. But it's British Columbia. And pot camps. You've got to be kidding. There are no pot camps in California. The are thousands of grow sites, but no one grows communally as portrayed in this joke of a series. If you're gonna try and portray an image of an area, at least make it somewhat believable."
270,"Not having even heard this was based on books, I just began watching it because of the setting and there's a midwife character. And I love the fact there are older characters played by actors that aren't young and super. Just normal people who wear normal clothes and act like normal people. And have some normal relationship problems and difficult life decisions. I enjoyed the show and hope there's another season coming."
271,"I am a sucker for romantic dramas, and Virgin River hit all the right spots.The plots aren't overly complicated and all the characters have their stories. It felt like everything was well thought through. The actors playing the characters are just WOW.I wanted to kill Hope like all the time but she plays her character just great. She even had me hating Charmaine.Jack is this brooding, handsome main character without all the cliche's. Mel has an annoying voice, but her acting is suberb. I could feel her pain in all the flashbacks.Before I knew it, I binged the whole season and wanted more ASAP.I really can't find any faults with this series, except for the fact that Netflix put Chesapeake Shores in the ""more like this"" section.All in all, it really is a Must Watch."
272,"Thought I'd give this a go, not expecting much of it. I was so wrong!
Loved it so much I couldn't stop watching! The chemistry between the main characters is great, the other actors equally are amazing. They all feel very believable, and very likable! Heart-warming, tear-jerking at times.
Can't wait for season 2!"
273,"This show has all the feels and is so relatable on so many levels.It's a feel good show with amazing actors, really good backstories for the characters without being cheesy.The relationship and spark between Jack and Mel is just so lovely to watch. Beautiful and strong characters..I binged 10 episodes in 24 hours... regret that now as I have to wait for a new season, hope Netflix doesn't make us wait too long!!"
274,"I love the characters, the scenery and the storylines."
275,"This is the perfect show! It's happy, sad, funny, and serious... it has a little bit of everything! Can't wait for season 2!"
276,"I just loved this series, I literally watched it in 2 days. It is so heart warming and something you could watch with the whole family. The characters are great and well played. It's romantic but not exaggerated. So good! I can't wait for the 2 season to be released."
277,Who wrote this cliche? There is not a woman in it who doesn't behave badly or at best stupidly. Not ONE! And the men sit back helplessly and let them.
278,It's so bad.... wrong play wrong screenplay 😌 actors are bad... nice shoots though
279,"Compelling story and easy to binge watch.. decent acting from all involved, good little Netflix series."
280,"So wholesome and refreshing to watch. Great storylines.
My favorite is Hope!!! I love her character, she's the best!!"
281,"Season one was okay, but now into season Virgin River starts to get on my nerves. There is only the scenery now that I like. The townspeople are so very two dimensional. The good and the bad. Nothing in between. Mel should by now have suffocated Charmaine with a pillow. But she simply is waiting for Charmaine to wipe her feet on her backside. Unbelievable. Jack is letting that happen to woman he loves for he is also to good to be true. And that goes for Hope and the doc, for Preacher and Paige. It is developing all so slow I yell that they must ""get on with it!"" Stop walking around each other and ""make that decision"". I don't think I survive a third season out of boredom."
282,"It's frustrating to watch something this bad when they had so much talent to work with. The actors are all capable of much better work. The script is really bad and predictable, and the director(s) let the cast get away with lazy, boring performances. The story is beyond lame and frankly not believable. It's like a goody goody Hallmark movie meets an embarrassingly bad soap opera."
283,"While I enjoyed each episode, I remained skeptical throughout the season that a show tagged as 'romance' would remain entertaining and captivating enough to truly be satisfying. To my surprise and absolute delight, this show was truly entertaining.The chemistry between the main characters, Jack and Mel, was super strong, and the same can be said for the supporting relationships. The flashbacks throughout the season provide valuable insight into the characters past, and establish the main characters as complex and interesting individuals.The plot is somewhat predictable, however, the strength of the characters and relationships renders this predictability irrelevant. I am truly thrilled to hear there will be a second season. Fingers crossed there will be many many more!"
284,A really warm series to curl up and relax too. Easy watching storyline with gorgeous location shots . Some parts were a little predictable but otherwise great escapism for a cosy night in.
285,"Despite not being my favorite kind of show, this one is really worth the try. Well written and acted, you will find yourself atracted to virgin river and his inhabitants. A very good surprise!"
286,A few of the actors/actresses weren't what I pictured after reading the books. Still a great show and representation of the books!
287,I'm not a big fan of emotional shows but this show was addictive! The characters aren't over the top and fun to watch.
288,"Melinda Monroe runs away from a traumatic past to take shelter in a quaint and beautiful little town named Virgin River, where she takes up a contract to work as a nurse practitioner and midwife. She is required to work with an aging, stuffy, and downright  boss Doc Mullins.Since there is only one season out so far, we will have to wait and watch to see how the characters develop.Everyone has an intriguing back story, and we get to see flashbacks into Mel's past life as well as her love interest, Jack's.Doc is great as a character, and even though you dislike him initially for being  chauvinist and judgemental, you start leaning into his character development.However his estranged wife, Hope McCrea is a caricature of a woman. She's hamming all over the place, and trying too hard to beat Diane Keaton in the hysterics department. The character is just awfully written. Being the Mayor of Virgin River, I think the writers did injustice to this woman's storyline and character development.I will probably edit this summary once I finish the summary.Bottomline - watch the series if you want to watch a light hearted, airy family drama with picturesque landscapes."
289,"I'm always in and out of shows my wife is watching on Netflix and Hallmark. She's binge watched Wildfire, Heartland, and Heart of Dixie over the past few months. All of those are fine shows, but I actually asked her to not binge Virgin River so I can watch it with her. She's only watched three episodes, and I've only seen parts of the first two and all of the third... but it's a good story, well produced with good performances. Unfortunately, there's only one season so far, but what we've seen through three episodes has both of us hooked."
290,Amazing story! Superb casting! Fantastic soundtrack! Virgin River has it all!!!!
291,"There is literally no surprise in this show. If you are not a fan of unrealistic love stories this show definitely won't keep your attention.I really had a hard time to finish the season waiting for something unexpected and more real to happen, wasted my time."
292,"I don't know if it' s for 12 yo or for after 80. Maybe not even for these two extremes: impecable hairdos at any hour and under any circumstances, women sleeping with makeup, lipsticks that never go ( what brand could they be?), sensitive ex-marines, a great community that works like a fairy tale family aso - too dangerous for a 12 yo to imagine and too unrealistic for after 80. Then what is the target public of this series?!Oh, and don't look for acting: Martin Henderson is the only one who's performance is worth the name. And still, it looks as if sighing was compulsory to perform in this movie!So at least it doesn't have violence and false heroes - give it a try if you've seen it all it's worth on Netflix and you can't find anything else, in a time of boredom."
293,"Sweet enough, easy to watch, nothing ground breaking, very predictable...a bit meh!"
294,"What saves this series is the beautiful location, Doc, Preacher, and the drug camp.
Nurse Mel is just too full of herself. Hope is an annoying character who behaves like a menopausal maniac and whose only pleasure in life is interfering in the lives of others, at their unfortunate expense. Jack deserves a better script. He's a retired Marine after all. Give the guy some teeth. All too wishy washy. No depth."
295,"I stumbled across this and gave it a shot; but, wasn't expecting to love it as much as I do. The characters are so unique; but, also well blended in this charming and quirky small town with an intriguing backstory. The first season was like peeling off layers of a complex, yet sweet story and with each layer, I couldn't wait for more. Needless to say I knocked out the first season quick and now anxiously awaiting season 2. Don't listen to the reviews that say it's the same as Hart of Dixie. Other than a few similarities, the stories and the characters are very different but just as easy to love."
296,"I think the similarities between this show and Hart of Dixie are few & not enough to matter.
This show is sweet, heartfelt and totally worth watching. Good characters with good acting. Sort of predictable but not cheesy. I reccomend it wholeheartedly."
297,"The person choosing the sound track for this show is {ON POINT}. Every song catches the emotion almost perfectly. It's very NoCal-Independent-Coffee-House. Whoever you are keep doing your thaaaang.Aside from that, it's the Poor Man's Outlander. Some of the same themes/situations etc. But it's good enough for a comfort binge...or background tv while getting through my day. I'll watch the second season for sure.However if the 2nd season includes Charmaine getting in a horrible accident, and the only thing they can save is the baby and her lips (because they're plastic), then giving the baby to Mel and Jack to raise as the child Mel could never have... I vow to shame the writers for the rest of my days. Please don't make season 2 typical. Please. I'm asking nicely.One last thing. Martin Henderson's ""American"" accent was unbelievable. I can usually can pick out actors who are putting on an American accent...like right away. Not this guy. I was tripping balls when I heard him talk in real life.Actually one more last thing. Is there anyone on this show who DOESN'T have dimples? Jeeez, I'm starting to get a complex."
298,It's basically a love story but there are so many other issues going on. It's very easy to watch and stay watching. I really liked it and can't wait for the next season! Excellent acting!
299,I'm really trying to like this show but I can't stand the character of Hope. Annette O'Toole's over exaggeration of the character seems amateurish. Hope makes me want to throw something at the tv. I like the rest of the story line but wish they would get rid of Hope.
300,"This very moment just saw a preview on Netflix for this show. Right away all I could think of was 'Hart of Dixie', which I love and which was also filmed on the set of Gilmore Girls. Will watch and give another review when done :)"
301,"Binged season 1 in 2 days
Can't wait til season 2!"
302,"So I understand this is based on a novel or something... but I feel like I am watching a teen movie... same quality of acting and cliche women cat fighting takes over the whole storyline. I mean was this written in 1982 or 2020?? My feminist self is vibing the wrong way!!
It's sad, it had some potential... I gave a star for the treatment somewhat ok of PTSD and grief.
If you haven't watch it yet, skip it, there is a bunch of better stuff out there !"
303,"I need to chill, this is lightweight , fill in some time, don't think too much about Monday kind of TV, but I fell into a hole of a beautiful love story (along with way too much looking left kind of angst acting). I am so annoyed with this program, not so much I turn it off and jog on but enough to carry on hoping someone would just drown 'Helen' Omgosh , I am so annoyed at myself for caring enough to create an IMDB account and use this forum to hate on a character. She is just horrid, I am so annoyed at her. I absolutely refuse to believe someone wasted 20 years of their life coexisting, I cannot buy it. Dang I'm so annoyed....grrrrrr she is so irritating ."
304,"Keep this show going. It's what we need right now. Great writing, wonderful acting and beautiful locations. Yes!! A dose of medicine we all need during times such as these. I love this show!"
305,"I loved Season 1: the relationships and characters were developed. Jack and Mel did a lot of fun things together, and had serious conversations and I slowly felt like I was getting to know them and like them, just as they were getting to know each other and like each other. The other characters were also interesting and fun to watch. Definitely, Hope was as annoying as heck. But, the fact that she was so aggravating showed what a great character was developed.
I thought the many ""soapy"" contrivances worked: they were handled well and added to the character development.I watched all of the first 3 episodes of Season 2, and rapidly skimmed through the last 7. It's such an awful disappointment. The three main plot ""segments""---Mel being Charmaine's healthcare provider/expert, Doc dating Muriel so that the town does not know he and Hope are reconciling, and Jack's dangerous interference in the drug trade--- are just churningly awful. They suck the life out of the characters and by the end of it, the characters are one-dimensional and boring. Even Jack and Mel lose the marvelous chemistry they had that was the central energy of Season 1.I would like to hope that the writers could get their acts together and recapture the hard work and charm of Season 1, but I am not optimistic. I couldn't wait for Season 2; I doubt I will finish it, and I doubt even more that I will watch a Season 3."
306,"I was hesitant at first when I saw the trailer.... being used to watch European and Scandinavian crime series all the time.
But, after the first minute I was hooked!
This series offers an escape(while laying under a blanket with a glass of wine and my cat).
The humor, the stories, the drama...I love it.... 10 episodes is not enough for one season. I watched it twice already.
I can't wait for what's still to come."
307,Good show! Any show that holds my attention like this one deserves some stars. Great binger!
308,"I enjoyed this show and the storylines. The best part is the scenery-which I Hope season 2 shows more of.One drawback: the flashback scenes are too quick and abruptly start and end. They're like a flash, not a memory.Worst part: the accents!! Come on! This takes place in California and half the actors are Canadian with obvious Canadian accents (because the show was filmed there). Isn't it an actors job to get into character and speak the way the person they're portraying should speak? That's what they get paid for! They're only doing half a job if they don't speak like a person from Northern California."
309,Girl leaves town for the country to work at a doctors office. Girl meets boy who work in The only bar. Even the same actor being the doctor as in Hart of Dixie. Come on! Invent something new....
310,"I really love this new show on Netflix. I've just started watching it but so far I really like it. It feels so authentic and sweet without being too cheesy.I particularly love the chemistry between Jack and Mel. Jack is such a sweet, caring handsome guy who just wants everyone, especially Mel feeling like home. Mel on the other hand is that apparently strong city woman who is looking for a fresh start in a new town trying to leave behind her some very painful memories. She's very sweet and caring tho and you can feel something beautiful is brewing between Mel and Jack and sincerely they both deserve each other.Looking forward to see more of them!"
311,"I loved it so much; the setting was as much a character as the people in the movie. The scenes are just breathtaking. I have never read the books but have heard that they focus more on Preacher his love interest next and Mel leaves. To me if they don't continue with the Jack and Mel love story it would spoil the whole show. Yeah, Page and Preacher development is fine but keep Jack (that dang Martin Henderson is easy on the eyes) and Mel moving forward. Great series and the series was very well casted. So excited about Season 2. Keep the Jack and Mel story going!"
312,"I very seldom watch a drama serious as our lives are filled with it every day if you watch the news. This show caught my attention on a cold, winter night so watched all episodes.
The show started off great. The first four episodes were about real life situations and how they were dealt with. Most of the characters except Hope (a little too much involvement) you could relate to. The flashbacks intertwined with the present set a good tone. I thought Alexandra Breckenridge and Martin Henderson had an excellent connection. Flashbacks of Preacher, Paige, Vernon, and Hope's past would be interesting.
Episode 5 could have been and should have been anything else bedside's another drug gang related scene and with the 10th episode involving the people in the grow-op and making it look like too much part of the show (not even good acting) that's what ruined it for me. The plot and drama between all the couples and how it is intertwined does not need the illegal pot growing crap. I would sincerely hope that the producers and writers continue the show around the main characters and add a little bit of humour here and there."
313,"Really goes off piste with the storyline, the books are wonderful and detailed. Whomever chose to tell Mels former life in flashbacks needs sacking, they're really poorly done for a start and incorrect. The introduction of additional characters is unnecessary; better time could have been spent on the main actors formulating the back story. The only thing I would recommend are the actors. They made good choices.
I do know people that haven't read the books finding it enjoyable because they have no comparison. I'd say read the books avoid the programme."
314,"I call this, Netflix does hallmark channel. Or Netflix does a soap opera with a fine grit sand paper."
315,"So why wouldn't you love it ? Like a classic dish, familiar ingredients but done well. The cast is amazing. Mel (Alexandra Breckenridge) is more than a looker. Her medical knowledge came off so easily and when she works a patient she displays great expertise and alacrity. And her heart is in the right place too showing compassion and care to her patients. Jack is reliable and falls for Mel's charms at first look. The side plots are interesting too. A lot of tension and conflicts. We are also introduced to the dark side in those serene , misty northern california hills - the ruthless hoodlums who run the pot farm. Novelist Robin Carr weaved a captivating plot using interesting people and clever plot twists. I can't wait for season 2."
316,"I'm on the first episode .. and so far so good. BUT?!?! 24:05 the mayor walks in a double door solid painted door..on the right side. Flip to the scene inside, and it's a single door stained glass door. Anyone else see this? LOL"
317,"Great acting, great script. Please bring it back soon."
318,"So glad I gave this show a chance! From the trailer it looked similar to Hart of Dixie but it was so much better. Great characters, brilliant setting and storytelling, strong acting all around. Season 2 can't come soon enough, I need to know what happens with everyone!"
319,"Stereotypical characters, unbelievable story lines, predictable outcomes. The stuff of standard romance fodder. Family entertainment? If I was a young man forced to watched this dross, I'd be screaming to be let out. It's clearly aimed at the pulp romance fiction market."
320,Remake of Hart of Dixie - even has same actor playing the old fashion doctor. Does have some more depth and better plot twists but totally predictable.
321,"Cheesy, predictable but quite good. Can't wait for season 2"
322,I'm a dude and I love shows like this because it's so relaxing and interesting. I love the story line and characters!
323,I love this new series! Can't wait for season 2 in June.
324,"This show is awesome!!! Just what I have been waiting for, another good one like Hart of Dixie. Thanks to Robyn Carr for the books this show is based on."
325,"My wife forced me to try this show, and I am pleasantly surprised. Love Tim Matheson and Annette O'Toole in their roles."
326,I am really enjoying this show. The lead actress is great! It's an engaging story. Worth the watch! Hope there is a second series!!
327,"This Californian ""Heart of Dixie"" has it's moments. The chatactets are relatable and sometimes even adorable. But the series structure botheted me. A lot. It's not actually a series, but a movie split in ten parts, with each episode begging exactly where the other ends. Thats, not a problem in itself, but that implies that the season must have some sort of an ending. One or more cliffhangers are expected, and even desirable, but there must be some conclusion
And that's not the case. The season ends abruptly, as if it was just half the story, half the episodes made. The crises are created, go in a crescendo, and the season simply ends at the peak, with no resolution whatsoever..
It's basically half a season,"
328,"I was hesitant about watching this because i thought it was a medical drama. While it is very much centered around a successful Nurse Practitioners transition to a rural way of life, her Chemistry with Jack was the main character in the first season! So much chemistry it left me wanting a second season immediately!"
329,This show is addictive I cant stop watching it. I watch the whole season in 1 day I cant wait for the 2nd season to come out.
330,This series is amazing!!! A must see series! Can't wait for next season!
331,"Love the Show. But please Charmaine can't lie to Jack's face so write in a letter. All of a sudden after being casual for 2 years you end up pregnant, please. She is just pissed she can't have Jack. And Jack doesn't want her. So lie to him. Mel is great I adore her. Jack and Mel are ment to be. Paige and Preacher would be great
together. Bradly is going to get himself killed. Doc is going to surprise you and mend things."
332,"If you're looking for a new series to binge watch, then this one is for you
Love the storyline!! Can't wait for season 2"
333,"I love hallmark movies, so a hallmark style series was a dream! I absolutely loved it, I might have binged season 1 in one day! Lol it's a cute series that tugs on your heart strings. Definitely recommend! Can't wait for season 2!"
334,I loved this show & like so many others cannot wait for the next season to be released!
335,Haven't read the book but will be doing so after watching series
336,"This series is some really good TV with a satisfying story line. The characters are likeable, enjoyable, & relatable. Great Job Netflix!! Keep up the good work-this is why we pay for you!! So tired of all the violence, crime, blood, & sex. Some of us like a story line that you don't have to hind in the dark to watch. Looking forward to many more seasons of watching this program!!"
337,"Love the show. Love the characters. But as a North Coast resident, I cant handle the location. They talk about the region I have known practically all my life and the location shots look nothing like reality."
338,"A really moving and beautiful love story (actually, more than one) between hugely sympathetic characters; stunning acting and setting; one or two slightly unconvincing twists, but above all an extremely frustrating ending leaving many threads in the air .... when do we get a sequel? Bottom line? I binged almost the wnole thing! Haven't done that since ""24""!"
339,"Loved this show, has a bit of everything. The characters are strong and hope that the writers can expand the story line with the other characters but would love to see what happens with Mel & Jack. Believe these characters could get back together, baby or not people should not stay together because of a child. Bring back all the characters including that scoundrel Brady."
340,I love cant wait for more.if u have not watched it please do. It is so good. I hope her and jack find each other in the next Year.
341,"Absolutely perfect filming locations and surroundings. Beautiful soundtracks and very good cast. The flashbacks are great. Alexandra Breckenridge is absolutely perfect as Mel! As a fan of the books i admit i am a bit disappointed by the portraying of Jack who should be quite much younger, short haired (!) and with manly and less passive attitude regarding his past of a team leader in the army. But the chemistry between the 2 leading actors is beautiful. Wasn't expecting Preacher to be as warm and talkative but well, for now I am curiously pleased by the portraying. Neither I was expecting Hope and Doc relationship, I understand the interest of it BUT... there's way too much Hope screen time!!! No matter how gorgeous and good the actress is, the character of Hope turns like a pain! Storyline: regarding the show and the books I am quite sceptical about the changes. I like the cliffhangers at the end of each episode but the the season ends in the middle of nowhere with no sort of conclusion nor answers with predictable cliffhangers... it looks like we're trapped in a half season! It should have been filled with much more suspense like there is in the books! Can't wait for season 2!"
342,I read these stories years ago. I was hooked on them. The characters are so warm and interesting. Have watched 4 episodes since far and am loving it.
343,"It's a great binge and one to get hooked on. Reminds me of Hart of Dixie minus the singing and shenanigans. But there's still drama and interesting story lines. It's not the best writing or acting ever, but its pretty good and you get a good hook on the characters and story lines the scenery is also great to look at. I hope its renewed."
344,"Finally an incredible romance drama on Netflix. The scenery and location is incredible!! The acting is superb but most of all it's an incredible storyline. So many arcs, interesting complex characters and the flash backs. Such great storytelling! Finally! And that last episode just leaves you hanging for more. Can't wait for season 2!! Netflix keep investing in great dramas like this!!!"
345,"Thoroughly enjoyed this show, I binge watched it on Netflix. Will have to try and find the books as I thoroughly enjoyed watching this"
346,"Love it, love it - love it. !!! Can't wait for s2. Watched all s1 today!"
347,"The story line isn't rushed at all, and I absolutely love how the plot develops!! Highly recommend this show. And the actors are pretty great!"
348,Although it's a good show. Reminds me very much of heart of dixie. Isn't the doctor in here the same as the one in heart of Dixie as well? Just seems like a copycat a bit..
349,"Oooh what a good nostalgia to Haert of Dixie show . Same actor , the dr i mean. Still on my first ep and it seams amazing."
350,The show is fine but it's Hart of Dixie. The doctor from Hart of Dixie is even the Doctor in Virgin River. Pretty bizarre. Same premise. Same actors.
351,"Easy to watch. Engaging characters. Interesting storylines and character relationships. My boyfriend and I binge-watched the first 4 episodes. Each time I asked him if he was good to watch another, and he said sure. I think it's safe to say we are both hooked."
352,My husband and I just bindge-watched the first season. We thoroughly enjoyed it and look forward to season 2. It seems that those who have read the books are indignant regarding how well it does or doesn't follow the story line. Glad I haven't read them so I can enjoy in ignorant bliss.
353,Really like this show. It has more meat to it than other shows of this type. Fully invested in the characters and their individual stories. Hope this doesn't get canceled.
354,All of the characters are quite intriguing! I love to 'hate' Hope! Can't imagine the show without her!
355,"Just binge watched series 1, love it!Will there be a series 2?"
356,"I love all these books, Robin Carr is a great writer! This is series has been done wonderfully. While keeping with the tone and direction of the book series this Netflix series also stands on its own, you don't need to read the books to enjoy watching.The creators did a great job of matching the actors to the book descriptions. I am crossing my fingers that they keep making this series, I loveD watching it.GREAT JOB!"
357,"Perfection in its genre! The entire production from casting, characters, location, stories, and the most effective piece, the music makes this binge worthy and easy to fall in love with, season two waiting with baited breath."
358,Hart of Dixie meets Mens in Trees. Definitely worth binge watching.
359,Granted I have only watched two episodes but I find this whole show very ignorant about Nurse Practitioners vs Nurses! They have no idea what a Nurse Practitioner is. Whoever their consultant is is either a very old person or not medical at all. Nurse Practitioners are not on the same level as a Nurse. They have either a Masters or Doctorate. The show keeps calling her a Nurse which is wrong. It's like calling a General a Captain. I find the shows ignorance offensive.
360,"A nice simple plot with real people.
I adore this, I'm watching it slowly as I don't want it to end. It's nice, people tend to be responsible and caring, I like that. Most series I just get through 3 or 4 episodes and then get fed up with complex plots and endless nastiness in various forms.
I hope there's a lot more series of this."
361,Moral of this story: always use condoms or pills. Moral of this story: always use condoms or pills
362,"So incredibly predictable. I wanted to like it, especially when I saw that it was set in Northern California (I lived there, and was wishing that Northern California ACTUALLY looked like that). But as I watched, everything was a trope: The lovely but beleaguered heroine starting her life over. The cantankerous small town physician. The handsomely grizzled bartender/pub owner, and the token black man who works there as a gifted ""farm to table"" cook. The exasperated but means well mayor. The supermodel bad boy who steals from the till. The run down cabin. It wasn't even bad in the way that could be amusing. It's just bad.Example: Heroine goes on an early morning hike in the extremely cold weather in her couture leather jacket and gloves and dainty boots. She brings a GIGANTIC purse with her as well. Because everyone needs a suitcase sized Celine bag as they hike through the woods. Handsome grizzled dude thoughtfully brings her wellingtons and tells her to leave the samsonite behind. They have ""meaningful"" conversation once they reach their destination, but not before she complains ""How much farther"". The stunning destination is reached, she enjoys it for two seconds, and then wants to know what's next. Handsome grizzled dude gives heroine his coat to put on over her idiotically thin jacket.Oh, and something that I felt was a really bad edit: several times people enter the doctor's office through a solid red wooden door, but once they're inside the door is all stained glass. Perhaps there is a foyer, but we never see anyone in a foyer, just straight from inside to outside. And what about the BMW that ended up in a ditch but suffered no damage? And how did the mayor clean up that wreck of a cabin in the time it took for the heroine to go have a meal at the pub? Boo!"
363,"Beautiful Big City girl with a tragic back story moves to small town with impressive views and lots of improbably good looking, age appropriate men living there - tick
The tortured veteran - tick
The older residents who are all ""characters"" - tick
Love triangle - tick
The low life criminal gang - tickEven the domestic violence story line was so trite and was so obvious from the beginning that she should have had it tattooed on her forehead!Mindless rubbish to have on in the background but there was absolutely nothing in this that hasn't been done before a 1000 times!! Sickly, soapy, overly dramatic and unrealistic.... but then that's what we want sometimes!"
364,"In what world would non artistic junk like this make top 10 charts? Top 1 in Australia Netflix atm..... Seriously? Are you all seriously this unintelligent that THIS show makes you happy?Art used to be creative. Made by real artists. Loved by everyone. Now, ""art"" is made by any donkey with a phone camera, a stupid idea, and the unintelligent people of the world to back them up. Maybe it's just covid... Wait, no, this is 2019... Hopefully covid will teach some of the unintelligent donkeys of this world what set actually is. Art isn't entertainment, even though it can be entertaining. Art is creative, thought provoking, and generally made by an artist.
This show is pure junk and should be removed from history. Please delete it...Cannot believe how stupid everyone is... But then, I guess you all think Rihanna is an artist too... Idiots..."
365,Cliché after cliché after cliché 🙄. Nothing original and it still misses the mark. Bring back Anne with an E!
366,"I decided to check these series out as they are rated number 1 on Netflix at the moment. From the first 5 minutes in, I knew what will happen in the next 20. The dialogues are so bad, predictable actions. I have never seen a worse Netflix production so far. I did give it a go though -I managed to watch 1 and a half episodes and decided that I cant not let my ears, eyes, brain, heart and soul suffer more. In the best case scenario one could watch this show while ironing, cooking, cleaning. But no, even then I rather listen to the radio."
367,"I watched season 1 and started season 2. I couldn't finish it. The main character is using that fake Mid Atlantic accent. She sounds like she should be on Gossip Girl. She didn't talk in that accent on This is Us.
She is sleeping with a basically married man. I just found her to be gross and the cause of her own problems.
Like Hart of Dixie, it's full of quirky characters and similar plot. They just took the fun out of it. Should have stuck to the books instead of revamping an imd show"
368,"Confirmation bias, confirmed. Tried to watch it, but it's a never ending loop of women overreacting or butting into others lives and creating drama."
369,"I have read and purchased these books on audible. I was so excited to see this was going to be series. I was disappointed on who casting chose to be theses characters. Mel, Jack , Ricky, Preacher is not the characters from the book. I have been disappointed and the storyline is not the same as the book. I was hoping season 2 would be better but storyline is still changing"
370,The stereotypical small town folks against the big city dwellers is MADDENING. That's not even close to the worst part. There's so many cringe moments in this series it's completely unwatchable. Why are all the women in this show treated as completely helpless? Hope is rude and acts like a child ...yet she's the mayor somehow. All these people do is argue and the acting is terrible. Every scene where they argue sounds like a a group of regular people reading a script trying to sound like actors. It's awful. The scenery is all wrong. There isn't any snow in Humbolt County. I. Just. Can't.
371,"A reviewer wrote ""no cliche unturned"", and it's the best description!
I'm at S1E1 to see why it's popular, and Hope is the only interesting character.
Good production though, nice shots and scenery; and with the theme being both relevant and somewhat escapist, I can see how some people would enjoy it. Also, the lead actress is very pretty and has some cute moves, which makes me want to watch her act!"
372,I mean if you like watch people talking for atm 2 seasons it for you personally my wife made me watch it and I've never slept so well in my life
373,"This show first and foremost has really awful acting. Rather than investing a lot in sets and filming etc. I think instead they should focus on the acting ability of the actors involved. It's really soap opera-y and the main character Mel is just very fake not convincing acting and the supporting characters aren't great actors either. The show is entertaining yes but it's not a great show. It's just something to watch if you have nothing else to watch & are bored, but it's definitely not good or great television. Doesn't compare to other addictive Netflix shows like YOU. YOU is cheesy but (minus Beck) the acting was great. You can have soapy dramas but at least make sure the acting is strong or else it all falls apart. Worth watching if you are bored & need something that's entertaining (and if you can tolerate the forced & unnatural acting)."
374,"I was so excited when I heard about the series. So disappointed when I watched the first episodes. Why change storylines that didn't need altering. The books are great, don't mess with it. People dead that shouldn't be dead, people already in the storyline who shouldn't be, adding other people storylines to Melinda and Jacks. Besides that, Jack ain't the book Jack, the camp in the wood is a clean filmset, nah it just didn't work for me. And I so much wanted to to work :)."
375,"...would be so much better if some characters had superpowers. Such a wasted opportunity. Lika a buff guy named ""Preacher"" doesn't fly and stop runaway trains? And brooding Jack doesn't have telekinesis or invisibility? Then if Melinda had xray vision or could read minds...and Charmaine has no powers and no clue this would be 11/10 !"
376,"Another rubbish drama about a pretty lady falling for a handsome man and then proceeding to try be with him by breaking up a relationship and leaving his unborn child fatherless.All we do is tell people it's ok to cheat on each other, hate it. No wonder this is the world of unmarried parents and divorced parents, the world of take take take..."
377,I like it for handling real issues yet still entertainment.
378,Good clean show with great actors. Can't wait for season 2.
379,"What I loved about Virgin River is the simple Story but it's not that simple, there're twists and turns. And the locations OMG 😍😍😍. The performances are top notch the film direction is fine but what impressed me the most is the beautiful cinematography, well you can give kudos to Vancouver BC for that too."
380,"The show is nice. Good acting though sometimes the story line is predictable.
Easy to watch."
381,"I saw the trailer and thought it was very like Hart of Dixie, especially with Doc etc but actually I was really impressed with how the storyline develops. It's very different. There's lovely storylines, as well as heartbreak and loss, but it feels more realistic than I was expecting from a drama."
382,"Sometimes you just want something to watch that is peaceful, sweet, hearttouching and warm! This one is for the girls! I was so addicted. Saw the first season real fast and i loooooved IT! Wished is was more series like this! Cant wait for S2!"
383,"Set in a fictional town named Virgin River, the show centers around Mel, a licensed nurse practitioner from LA, who decides moving to the quaint town seeking solace and perspective, and possibly, to start over, after having been through some unforgiving experiences in her life.Curious to join Dr. Vernon's clinical practice as a nurse in Virgin River, Mel makes arrangements and later, as fate, would have it, meets Jack, a local bar owner who also happens to be a Marine Corps veteran. He tackles his own not-so-perfect past while making sure every customer at his bar get their orders on time. Mel's past has not left her, however, as she continues having flashbacks of her life with ex-husband Mark, who met a road accident, leaving Mel completely broken.Hope Mcrea, Dr. Vernon's wife, plays a very important role. She helps Mel blend in with the local town where everyone knows everyone. But she also has a habit of landing herself and others in troubles as she cannot keep secrets.Starting over is difficult for Mel. But remaining in the past is worse. Watch this 9-episode drama on Netflix if you enjoy touching stories."
384,Very good show. All episode finished in 1 day. Waiting for S2 :)
385,So this show is very similar to the basic storyline of Hart of Dixie (in which Tim Matheson plays literally the exact same character-grumpy hometown doctor who's mean to the new doctor/nurse). But I like Alexandra Breckinridge and I find her much less grating than the lead actress in Hart of Dixie. Overall this is a good show so far and I look forward to seeing more!
386,Didn't think it would end with Episode 10. Now i can's wait for the next season. Very heartwarming series!
387,"Love it! Sugar sweet show, hallmark ish. Can't wait for another season!"
388,"Each character was cast superbly. A wonderful wholesome show with a bit of excitement, romance and intrigue, not to mention the intricacies of small-town relationships. Managing the waters will be a challenge for the LA nurse-practitioner, but she's up to it."
389,Absolutely loved this show! Very suspenseful! Kept me engaged and I didn't find it predictable. Binge watched it as fast as possible because I couldn't get enough! Can't wait for season 2!
390,"Wasn't sure what to expect but it turned out good. It isn't all sappy like This is Us , a lot more interesting. The characters get you liking them fast. The second season was added so I hope it stays good."
391,"Alexandra Breckenridge and Martin Henderson are the very accomplished leads in a dramatic, romantic, edgy series. It is a very highbrow Hallmark style with broken people doing the best they can. They are carrying baggage from battle, from personal tragedy, depression and disappointment. One of those rare series one can thoroughly recommend for the whole family"
392,"I like this series because of the story line, but with the jaunty sound track, it reminded me more of a Hallmark production than Netflix. I could do without some of the extra old biddies too. I'm 71, so it isn't an age thing, it's just annoying. I am looking forward to a next season to see where it goes."
393,"I just finished this yesterday and I am already can't wait to see what happened next! The soundtrack is awesome, all the storylines are good and great actors & acting!"
394,"I love the romance, the drama the crime and the actors and actresses...keep it up Netflix this show will go far"
395,"Too soapy
Schmaltz
Grieving widow. Can't get over it. Unresolved grief is never healthy
She seems strong but she's spineless and can't stand up for herself to anybody. Not Doc, not her sis. No one. She's strong and whiny.
Her character is a nurse practitioner. Not sure who their consultant is but they need a new one. There is a huge difference between a nurse and a nurse practitioner. She should set up her own shop and get in with it
Why do I keep going?"
396,"I have just binge watched the entire season and can't wait to see season 2!
How could you leave it like that, do Jack and Mel get together, what's happened to Paige?
This could be as long running as Greys anatomy!"
397,I really enjoy this show and the care for everyone in the community.
398,"Ok, I really like this series. Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of shows set in small towns. I absolutely loved Hart of Dixie. While the first episode presents several similarities to Hart of Dixie and had me questioning how authentically different this show would be, by episode 2 it really started to turn into its own. I love the characters and their individual stories. Netflix won me back with this series. I'm glad I gave it a chance and I'm looking forward to the next season."
399,Began watching this recently and straight away was reminded of Luke and Coraline from Gilmore Girls. Another small town fell good romance series. Easy to watch and predictable.
400,Everything about this series is amazing. I would suggest to it those people who like simple romantic stories with a little bit of twist.
401,"Love the story of the series. Love the actors. Really hope Mel and Jack stay together, they are meant to be together."
402,"Not a particularly realistic story, but it's entertaining and the cliff hanger endings keep you hooked. Likeable characters (with the exception of annoying Hope), beautiful setting and a sweet romantic story- it's definitely not perfect but it's a pleasant way to waste a of couple hours"
403,"I over looked this show several times because of the name. Somehow, Virgin River doesn't connote something I would want to watch. Not exactly sure why the name is such a put off but definitely pushed me away from this fabulous series for way too long. Maybe I haven't gotten far enough into it to get the reference, but, the key is to pull folks in to begin with and, sadly, the title Virgin River won't do it."
404,"When I started watching this show I wasn't sure if it was going to turn into a ""Hallmark style"" series and I was thrilled when it didn't. These people are real and they have real problems. I am looking forward to series two which I hope they don't wait too long to make."
405,"This series was good. It's not like a Hallmark though, as it didn't leave us with a happy ending. It actually kind of annoyed me how many loose endings this series left unfinished. I hope there's another season to tie it up, but it will probably leave just as many unfinished endings as this one."
406,"I found this new series addicting. I'm not a ""binge"" watcher as a rule-but I couldn't stop watching this show. After a week or so, I decided to watch it again, one episode a night. That didn't last, I finished it in 3 days. It's based on a book series that I loved. Though it doesn't follow the books completely, the program creators stayed true to the ""idea"" of Virgin River. Can't wait for season 2 and hoping there will be many more."
407,"Take it for what it is,a beautiful lovestory with a great scenery! Love it, binged it and can't wait for more seasons! Hopefully more than just one more!!"
408,You will absolutely LOVE this series. Real people with history and issues who come together to support each other through life as a small town community. Great characters you will fall in love with right away...and want more and more.PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE come back and come back quickly!!!
409,"Best ***Decent show clean words used. Excellent characters chosen. Hopefully you will this particular show ""Virgin River "" will continue. Please."
410,I really enjoy and love this show. I will actually miss the characters and the beautiful scenery. The storylines twine around the town and create such a beautiful story that's easy to care about. It's interesting and positive and heartbreaking and I'm excited for season 2!
411,"Breckenridge is so lovely in this role. Such a nice series, very enjoyable to watch. It's the perfect series to watch on a rainy day with a hot cup of coffee. Good story, good actors, beautifully filmed, gorgeous landscapes, and because you get to know a little more about the characters' backgrounds in every episode it keeps you interested. Can't wait to see more!"
412,"Don't know which came first the books or the movie Doc Hollywood. Comes across as the plot details of Doc Hollywood were snipped into pieces, tossed in a bag and then 80% were taken out and served as the script of this series after changing the main characters gender and of course she can't be a doctor so make her a nurse."
413,"Lots of chemistry between Mel and Jack. Way more than what he had with Dr. Grey.
The only part was a bit cheesy was what was going on Preacher and Paige....not that it isn't a good storyline. The acting just does not seem natural.Doc is so handsome even if he is grumpy :)"
414,"Ok, the story is a soap / hallmark type of story, but it's still ok, but the horrid music just kills it. Please stop."
415,One of the best web series seen virgin river is truly amazing and the story line keep gripping and i will recommend to my friends.and relative to watch it cant be missed
416,"No doubt about it. The horrid old crock of a Doc is played by the same guy, using the same dialogue. ""I am not old, I'm old school"". I believe was said by the same guy in Hart of Dixie."
417,Watched the first half hour and it seems to me this is almost exactly the same story as Hart of Dixie. Even the grumpy doctor is played by the same actor.
418,"There's a lot of programmes that have been on like this where city person moves to a small town but nothing I have enjoyed as much as Gilmore Girls or Everwood until now.
I'd watch the first couple of episodes but they didn't hook me like this did. It helps that it has some great acting. Mel is well played and you feel her pain. You want to see her happy.
Is it just me that doesn't like Hope? I'm still failing to see her good points.
If you want to be picky, In a town that small can there be so many secrets and dramas? It's not real life. Season 1 was too short and I can not wait for season 2."
419,"Enjoyable, but whoever cast the older sister Joey really erred. Every time she is on screen it pulls me out of the story because she looks 20 years too old for the role. It's funny how one casting error can make a story so much less believable."
420,"I love nearly everything about this show, acting is good and the stories are entertaining, but the character Hope really gets on my last nerve. I know it would be totally dull if all the characters were the same and all likeable, but she is just beyond irritating. In reality no one would give her the time of day and she'd have been ostracised by the whole town."
421,"Easy watching, predictable drama, set in small town backwater California. Reminiscent of Doctor Quinn or When calls the Heart, but set in modern times.Its not horrible, but there are no surprises. Its mostly small town drama with a bit of medical jargon thrown in. The writing is smooth and coherent, plot moves forward at a steady plod, acting is fine. Its really just unremarkable, and likely when series 2 comes out I would have forgotten I had watched series 1. Something to watch while doing the cooking or housework, where you don't need to concentrate on nuance."
422,I've read all the books in the series along with the Clear River Series!! The TV series is also very good! Love the actors. Glad it was renewed for a 2nd season!
423,"Just what you need on a cold winter's day. This show is pretty predictable but with a couple things you won't see coming. A bit slow moving at first, but stick with it. I binged it in 2 days."
424,"I give the writers and actors kudos for character development, we like them and want to follow their lives. However, the turn of events towards the end of the series is such a cliche that one wonders if the writers became exhausted....or what! It was disappointing, but one can only hope they redeem themselves should this story continue to a second series. Sadly, I would vote no. Cancel."
