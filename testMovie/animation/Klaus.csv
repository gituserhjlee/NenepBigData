I don't usually cry during movies, but I'm sitting here writing this review with tears in my eyes. I think it is going to become a new movie to watch every Christmas with my family!"
1,"One of the sweetest, emotional and best Animated film of the year. Netflix please keep bringing us movies with great script such as this."
2,"Klaus was a heartwarming animation with a very unique take on the ""Christmas origin"". I originally put it on as background noise for folding laundry but caught myself sitting on the bed for the entirety of the movie. The animation was really well done and the characters were memorable. I loved the similarities with Tim Burton films. It's nice to have a different Christmas film but that has the spirit nevertheless.
One of the best Christmas animations in awhile. Great film!"
3,"Okay, when it comes to Christmas movies to me there was only one: It's a wonderful life by Frank Capra. The Bishop's Wife and Love Actually are also very good but they don't have the same magic.
This year I can finally add a new classic: Klaus. It's a funny and surprising tale of how the real Santa Claus was born. I love the story and especially the look of this movie is amazing. Klaus is hand drawn animation but thanks to computers it has astonishing lit scenes. That makes the journey extra special.The story is about this lazy and clumpsy guy, Jesper, who is the only son of the director of a Mail School. His father wants to teach him a lesson and sends him to this little snowy place called Smeerensburg. Only if he succeeds in delivering 6000 letters in a year he's allowed to come back and continue his luxery life.
Of course Jesper obeys: he doesn't have a choice. But when he arrives at Smeerensburg he discovers that his mission is an almost imposible one. Two rival families are at constant war with each other and will never send each other letters. But when Jesper visits his last hope, this hermit called Klaus, something magical happens. By accident this mourning figure receives a letter from a child and wants to return this nice gesture by giving the boy a present. Suddenly all the childeren of the village want to send letters...Why does Santa always say ""Ho! Ho! Ho!?"". How did he get his reindeers? Does he really have a naughty book? Why does he travel on a sleigh? All those questions will be answered in this great tale of one man, Jesper, changing the fate of a town that once only knew anger and never friendship. The end of Klaus is actually quite moving.Forget The Polar Express or all the Christmas Carols. Klaus is the real deal! Go see it on Netflix!9/10"
4,"Very solid original story, awesome visual style and great writing. All it takes. On the contrary, reinventing 30 year old cartoons and doubling down on puritan stuff does not help.This film deserves broader recognition - best Christmas catroon in a long long time"
5,"I haven't felt this good after watching a movie. I feel good about myself. I am not kidding, I actually cried during and after the credit rolled. Thank you Netflix."
6,"For my first holiday movie of the season this is a must see.
Well written and beautifully done, also absolutely hilarious yet so heartwarming."
7,"What a joy to watch! I absolutely loved this hand-drawn animated film, the story kept me entertained from start to finish and I'm very glad that Netflix is giving this art form a platform on its streaming service."
8,Just watched with my kids. Absolutely loved every minute of it. A beautiful family movie that is sure to become a Christmas classic.
9,What an amazing movie ! The animation is perfect and the plot even better. Worth every minute.
10,"Sure, sappiness is cute, and fun to indulge in. I thought I'd seen it all. But what sappiness was in the movie well used. The main thrust was not sappy. It was a well told story, with the proper nuances in the animation and the vocalization. I consider this movie to be for adults. You will thoroughly enjoy it."
11,"Wasn't sure what to expect but completely exceeded all my expectations. Funny, smart and with heart. The animation and production quality is fantastic. Has that classic 2D animation aesthetic combined with 3D. Feast for the eyes, mind and heart. Great film, thanks for the little Christmas gift. üòÅ"
12,"Yes i said it. That is a big statement to back up but i believe that this movie covers anything christmas is all about. Not just that, it is really one of the best Santa Klaus story ever if not the one.Solitude, selfishness, hatred -- All these attributes have to stand this christmas movie and bow down to the love, warmth, kindness this story brings.Thank you for making this one and reminding us all what great animated stories are about."
13,"A truly heartwarming story. About how little kindnesses can make life more beautiful, children's laughter can warm the heart and Christmas can actually be a beautiful contemplative time.A truly beautiful Christmas story is told here with humour and love for detail. For young and old. I could watch the film again tight now.. :)"
14,It is just a perfect christmas movie. Amazing animation mixed with joy and emotions. Highly recommended if you are looking for some extra happiness and to hop into christmas spirit..Happy holidays in advance.
15,"If postmodernism is defined as a rejection of morality and human nature, then this animated story is a repudiation of that rejection, but done in a refreshingly adult and not too overly sentimental way.Thankfully, there are none of the usual Hollywood tropes; rather, the characters and situation are very grounded despite having elements of the fantastical and surrealism mixed in. It is not even Disney-esque, which is also a very good good thing.That this ""Santa Claus"" is not the only main character is moreover a good choice by the writers. By doing so, the story is able to focus on how a mythical character could conceivably come to be - and that makes for a very interesting and entertaining premise.Everything about this animated story is well done: The animation is crisp and detailed; the dialogues are convincing and at times humorous; the music fits, is modern, and used judiciously.Young children will not probably understand the deeper meanings, but everyone else will."
16,It's a true masterpiece ! So touching story. It reminds me of old good stories that later became films for children. This is the very best story of Santa Klaus I've ever seen ! Great animation and voices. Thank you for bringing such a nice story to life.
17,"This is what this film feels like: sitting around a fire and being engrossed in a story that someone remembers from long ago. Is the plot very original? Maybe not, but it is well paced and has some surprises along the way that make Klaus special.
Here, we have a sincere, funny and engaging film, that doesn't rely on ironic jokes to tie in the adults, or on the integration of modern technology to hold the kids' interest. It just tells a story.The story is about a spoiled young man who is sent into the little backwater village of Smeerensburg to take over the post office. Jesper has to deliver 6000 letters by the end of a year or he'll be cut off by his wealthy father. After he meets the reclusive toymaker Klaus, Jesper starts to plot his way out of Smeerensburg by roping in the kids of the village. Along the way he makes some friends, changes some lives and, well, grows up.This is, in a way, Jesper's coming of age story, even though he is a fully grown man to begin with. But this is also Klaus' growing old story. I found this apect very touching - the old and widowed hermit finds a new purpose in his life and gets to be happy for a few years yet. You do not see that sort of plotline in animated movies very often. The subplot of the warring clans of Smeerensburg was hilarious and reminded me a little of Asterix and Obelix.Apart from the old school, but very well executed plot, it is worthwhile to talk about Klaus' technical realization. Firstly, the animation is gorgeous. The lighting is magnificent. The look is excellent. This film looks exactly as lovingly detailed as a Christmas movie should. The handdrawn animation is very effective - it gives the film a very soft and almost canvas-like feeling, while still making good use of the smooth and fast execution that CGI affords.Klaus isn't dunked in polished, on-the-nose effects, but is, you might say, warmly covered in a carefully crafted blanket of twinkling forest lights and harsh mountain snows and accompanied by a little, gruff town of crooked and funny looking houses and crooked and funny-looking people.
In Klaus, we do not encounter a string of slightly altered clones, that all have the same body type and facial features (looking at you Disney) but a jumbled ensemble of big and round, tall and bent, young and middle aged and old characters, who all look and act differently from each other.The only criticism I can honestly think of is that Klaus lacks a little on female representation. Its central female characters, Ava and M√°rgu, felt a little sidelined to me, especially given the fact that theirs could have been the better story, if told accordingly. But given the fact that I still loved it, I can't really hold this against Klaus.So, just in time for Christmas, Klaus is a thoroughly enjoyable treat of a movie that I will probably recommend excessively over the next few weeks."
18,We really missed the classic animation! Thanks to Netflix for its return. Klaus is an amazing cartoon that creates a festive atmosphere. The ending can really bring to tears.
19,"Maybe because I did not know much of it when we chose to watch it with the kids, maybe because it was a cosy evening together with family, maybe because most good things happen unexpected, but it was just so much enjoyable that it scored immediately the top of my personal animation movies¬¥ ranking, even more than my beloved the incredibles....
The first 10 minutes I thought I was watching the wrong movie....what the hell has a spineless spoiled son of the chief postman to do with Santa Claus??? And then piece by piece ""you connect the dots....""....and it¬¥s a revelation, an epiphany, a ""credible"" discovery/explanation of the origin of Santa Claus¬¥ many legends, but most of it, a memory of the reason why the world needs Xmas, or whatever you call it if you are not Christian, because ""an act of selfless kindness...."". Don¬¥t miss it!!!"
20,"There are two type of people in this world.
1. They very much liked Klaus
2. Monsters"
21,The movie kept me glued to the screen the whole time
22,"I typically wouldn't mention a movie as a classic except for the two first films of Shrek. But Klaus it's amazing.Allow me to explain myself.There are so many reasons why Klaus remains as a classic.FIRST of all and the most visible one:THE ANIMATION. I'm not an animator but I love animation so I can tell when something is beautifully animated. Klaus isn't animated by computer, is hand-drawn animation which involves so much more work and it's worthy at the end because the result is so delightful. The colors, the details, the characters, the locations and every particular aspect are properly drawn, so you feel so good watching it.SECOND: You need more than looks to produce a classic and this film has a pretty good STORY. The plot is simple, a post man is sent to the unhappiest place in the world to deliver 6,000 letters, but in this place nobody delivers letters. Simple, the way that this plot seeks his way to include the origin story of Santa Claus it's amazing. Every twist is graceful and the ending is satisfactory.THIRD: animation and story are reached because of THE CHARACTERS: Every single and unique character has their own storyline developed satisfactorily.From beginning to end, the film is perfection for the Christmas holiday."
23,Wonderful movie and the animation is just amazing.
24,"This movie is a new classic for the years to come. The visuals, the story, the characters are great. Absolutely loved every bit of it. I watched the movie in french because i love how they speak french in animation movies but I will definitely watch it again in english. I recommend this movie."
25,"What a great film, it had absolutely everything you want in a Christmas film and with a new twist on a classic story it hits it out the park for me. Well done who ever made this film, fantastic."
26,"As I get older Christmas gets less and less exciting for me as an adult. This movie has warmed my heart to the point that i want to believe with all my heart. This story is fresh, original and to me one of the best Christmas movies I've seen in my lifetime."
27,"Amazing way to rewrite the Christmas story, great graphics, lovely movie and tears during all time. Klaus is going to be now my Christmas evening movie"
28,"I am a Muslim and I don't believe in Santa but I definitely believe in ""A true selfless act always sparks another"" and I definitely can relate to the joy the heart experiences when you make an unknown person, specially a child happy. Thank you Klaus (2019) for pushing that message across. In a world drenched in bloodshed and hate, that is a much needed therapy for all of us. I am sorry I can not rate and give 10 stars as only real life itself can get 10/10. So you will have to settle with second place. Only 9 stars for you and lots of love. Peace and Allah u Akbar!"
29,"As valid as any other conjured story about a benevolent old man with a fluffy grey beard. Great animation through an original tale albeit one whose characters don't demonstrate too much diversity which may leave it slightly less appealing to those not of Western European descent, nothing new there though."
30,"This movie turns every usual Christmas trope you see In a holiday movie to something completely new. A fantastically well animated movie, that tells a classic story with a fresh take."
31,"Fantastic and beautifully made, a truly great christmas movie. A lovely origin story of the wonder of klaus.A real must see this christmas for the whole family."
32,"Fun-spirited and an absolute delight, Klaus just may be not only the best christmas movie of the year, but also of the decade. Fit with beautiful animation, wonderful voice work, and a charming sense of direction, Klaus aims to please and does so almost irresistibly. The film, at its worst, may seem a bit formulaic, but is plenty full of many surprises without that will make you not want to look away from the screen. The film is also cleverly funny, with humor on par with that of The Emperor's New Groove and another Christmas classic of the decade, Arthur Christmas. What's so remarkable about the film however, is that, besides its ownership under Netflix, it simply isn't owned by a huge animation company. It feels small, and looks underwhelming, and like a gift of the same nature, is an absolute delight once you find what is all truly inside.
My Rating: 9.75/10"
33,"This is a gorgeously animated and beautifully scripted film that will tug at your heartstrings in unexpected ways. In the middle of all the saccharine, cloying and formulaic Christmas movies, 'Klaus' really stands out. The voice acting is really good. And it is thoughtful and deep in a way children's films aren't always are. Have a box of Kleenex near you."
34,"I loved this film from start till finish. love the retro way of making this movies, lots of humour and the right amount of sentiment. Will be a classic to watch every year around xmas."
35,"Heart-warming, beautiful. At the same time deliver the most realistic story of Christmas in a sense that not only the adult can understand but the children can also comprehend and appreciate the true meaning of a magical figure Santa Claus."
36,"A heartwarming, charming and gorgeous animated movie that retells Santa Clause's origin story in a new and interesting way, although it does stumble in some places, especially with it's familiar story that we've experienced before and hitting most of the same beats (but that doesn't mean that it didn't had great moments); some of the characters needed more development (like the schoolteacher Alva, who unfortunately comes out as a generic love interest, while still shines in some moments throughout the story), while others (the villains) can be considered average at best; music, which was 30% great, while the other 70% didn't stand out all that much or the composer is repeating the same music a couple of times and the dialogue was great and in some moments OK at best, which included jokes that weren't all that funny.There is one thing that i want to mention: before i saw the movie, i read some reviews and saying that the main character Jesper has the same characteristics with a another existing character in a animated movie and that character was Kuzco from the movie ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and how they were too similar to each other. There is truth to that discussion, since Jesper starts out the same way and act the same way throughout the movie, but for me - he did grow on me the more and more i continue watching the movie and i started to separate him and Kuzco from one another and Jesper did stand on its own as a character.I'll just say it, since it's the most noticeable thing in the movie: i ADORE the animation. It's so gorgeous to look at. All of the designs of the characters, the environments, the movements of the characters and the lighting are just masterfully made and the cinematography accompanies it and making it jaw-dropping to look at. If that movie doesn't inspire you to become a animator, then i don't know what can.I'm so happy that people from around the world are still keeping the spirit of the traditional animation alive and proving to the huge corporate studios, who abandoned that technique of animation (i'm looking at you Disney), which existed for far long than we can remember is not dead and it doesn't give up on a fight. That doesn't mean that i don't adore the 3D / CGI animation that Pixar created (which i'm so grateful for that), which also creating a new way to tell stories, but it's sad that we only get 3D / CGI animated movies in the movie theater and the only way to see new traditional animated movies is on streaming services like Netflix or in festivals. Movies like ""Klaus"" still give me hope and that's a good thing. I'm giving ""Klaus"" a 7.4/10."
37,"What an interesting angle to the great Holiday of Christmas. The unusual dark presence and aroma of the film in the beginning contrasted by the steady growing happiness and Christmas throughout the film is awesome. The pacing of the film is excellent, not too much in depth character development save a few characters but they all work well together, I love the contrasting personalities of Jesper and Klause and how it compliments them becoming friends. The story was a unique and interesting take on Christmas and was a treat to watch, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!"
38,"One of the most moving films in the history of animated films. Shining, magical, exciting. Klaus is directed, written and animated like the classic animated films that have accompanied us throughout our lives: masterfully. Original story, which there was the need to tell, mixing a story of origins and magic, giving life to something extremely unique. One word: beautiful."
39,Saw the highly anticipated Klaus. As indicated the beautiful animation did not disappoint. Went in with very low expectations for the story but was pleasantly surprised with the worldbuilding.
40,They really nailed to making of a Santa Claus origin that makes sense. This movie is magical experience for any christmas movies fans who especially looking for a childhood spirit.
41,"Very heartwarming animation
Beautiful aesthetics and artistry
Perfect Voice cast
Best Christmas film released in a long time"
42,"Wonderfull, outstanding the perfect start into the Xmas season."
43,"I am not if this is how really Santa Claus story started but this movie is really worth watching! Amazing, logic heartbreaking emotional wonderful story! If this really the true story i just want to say WOW!!!!!"
44,"I like everything , story telling is charming and exciting i never felt boring like it all"
45,"I kind of missed old-style animations. Everything is either made by pixar or trying to look like pixar. Not that the pixar is bad or something, but I just grew kind of tired watching almost the same animation over and over.Klaus feels like refreshed 2000s era of animation. Remember Treasure planet? Or Titan AE? They were both unique and awesome and Klaus feels exactly like them.Story well... it's pretty cliche. No earth-shattering changes. With a quite brave end, which I won't spoil.It was fun :)"
46,Instant masterpiece! Best Christmas film I've seen in a long time. This is one of those movies you could watch every Christmas with family. Animation was stunning and magical. Voice acting was so well done it brought the characters to life. 10/10 amazing work!
47,"I've seen this beautiful animated movie because of Zara Larsson's song-Invisible (the movie sountrack) .
I love the story,the characters....such a great movie to watch with your family when the winter holidays are coming !!!
It's worth it !!!"
48,"A truly lovely story perfect in every way.
I would recommend this for all the family, even the most hard of hearts would find this telling truly beautiful."
49,"This holiday film is destined to be a classic! A lesson about traditions of strife being busted up by children learning to play together makes for brilliant holiday season fare.The evolution of myth and new traditions unspools so wonderfully, the film is a joyride!"
50,Was expecting an okay Christmas story but got so much more. This ties in the story of the original St. Nick and adds the flair of the new Santa Claus. Well done.
51,Beautiful art direction. Very well animated. Good story. Great cast. Why is Norm McDonald not credited?
52,"There really is something magical about Christmas. And this movie shows exactly that. Deep down we are good and when we find our inner child made out of pure innocence and free from the influence of bad actions and thoughts we will find joy, happiness and we will make ourselves better through making others better. Touching and absolutely beautiful!"
53,"Cried almost whole film. its AMAZING, me and my friend absolutly loved it!! would watch it every year& will recomend it to everyone!. meaningful storyline, beautiful animation, warmed my heart <3"
54,"Breathtaking journey from start to finish .. i am a 24 year old male and never leave reviews on things like this! But this movie is an instant CLASSIC! a must see , spot on netflix"
55,"This is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen. I grew up as a kid in the 90's surrounded by classics, such as Home Alone, The Santa Clause, Elf, and so many more. This movie is brilliant in its wit and humor, and it touches in the heartstrings of the human soul like no other movie of this genre ever has for me. I was awed by the creativity and the brilliance of the plot, writing, and animation. I will watch this movie each year with my family - a new family tradition."
56,Something everyone needs ... Klaus is awesome. The characters feel real and well written. Reminded me of my child hood. It's not just for kids ... we can learn a thing or two as well
57,"And thats my understatement for the year. I remember seeing the movie's test trailer and was FASCINATED by the beautiful animation. So I waited, followed the studio, the development, the videos they posted, became overjoyed by seeing netflix picking it up for production and when the time came, I sat down, closed the curtains, and started the movie.
Every moment of the movie, I was like ""this animation..."" because... yea, it's the crown jewel of this movie, the reason I was so hyped to see it, the animation is BEYOND GORGEOUS! Hands down a perfect hand-drawn animation by a Disney veteran and expert character designer with a team of the best he could get on a small scale. This movie feels like every one involved with it loved their job. The backgrounds, the movements, the lighting, oh sweet gingerbread, the lighting was just amazing. Every shade, hue and colour was just GLOWING and every background could be framed on a wall. The story itself is really fun, they didn't hold back on how the characters move, sound and interact with each other, the plot itself was quite fun and worked out the emotions just in the right way. The pop song felt a bit cheap, but hey, product of it's time, at least it wasn't distractive.
The ending got me a bit teary, it felt bittersweet for a moment, but then it threw that christmas warmth over me.
The characters, IMO were all likeable. Jesper is a fun, quick-paced nitwit that reminds me a lot of Kuzco from The Emperor's new Groove (down to the voice actor sounding startling similar to David Spade!), Klaus is a stoic, large figure with a little bit of sadness but plenty of space for joy, and J. K. Simons was a amtch made in heaven for that. The side characters were also lovely, especialy the antagonists. The movie also worked perfectly the subtle colour palette between the clans to make it pretty visible which citizen was from which clan (and I loved that paralel dialogue of the clan's history) and the character design was superb. Each character brimmed with personality and had a very original shape, outline and animation so they stand out in the crowd. In sum, this wasa holiday experience I didn't even know I needed so much, and another investment in animation that Netflix have done right. Keep up the good work, all of you. And I expect this old art to maybe find itself back into our lives, as a true act of kindness, always sparks another."
58,"The story is unique with stellar animation, and Norm McDonald as the snarky boatman puts the cherry on top! Everything about this movie surpassed my expectations.
This delightful, albeit predictable Christmas production kept our interest with snappy dialogue and wonderful characters.
Watching alone or with the family, this movie succeeds in immersing viewers fully in a chocolate fondue of comforting distraction. Don't miss this one. They worked hard and hit this one out of the ballpark."
59,"We were long overdue for a decent Christmas movie.
It's a funny, whimsical animation that's guaranteed to bring you joy and the occasional tears to your eyes.Although it's one of those scripts where the ending is predictable for the most part, the ride is still very enjoyable and beautiful. It is written in a brilliant witty way to explain how some of the Christmas traditions came to be, while also giving credit to the postmen.The music list chosen for this movie was also pleasant and fitting.If you're looking for a decent comedy to watch, I would definitely suggest this movie. It's not the best Christmas movie of all time but it's the best Christmas movie to have been released in a long time. Enjoy!Fav scene: ""That's what you get for messing with the post man"""
60,"Everything about this droll take on the Santa myth is inspired. JK SImmons as the title character, the animation style, the way in which the various elements of the mythos come together organically and so forth all just fit. Even the final moment of magical realism is just right. It all adds up to a heart warming tale of Christmas.I will be watching this each year for awhile."
61,I just loved everything about this movie. It was perfect!
62,I initially thought I was going to watch a B level Disney want to be film but was so surprised about the clever writing and emotional depth of the story. Kudos to the writers for presenting such wonderful story full of humor and yet such wonderful pathos on a classical story. Thank you!!
63,"This movie is absolutely amazing. Wonderful story (reminds me of a Finnish christmas movie ""Joulutarina"") with great message! I especially enjoyed the representation of Sami people (the native people of Finland, Sweden and Norway) and hearing Sami language in a film like this is revolutionary!"
64,"What I have just seen?
It is not another boring Christmas movie.
It is not the same old story of Santa Claus.
Also, it is not the'' Just For Kids '' cartoon.
Moreover, it is not only just an amazing CGI and animation film.It is a re-written story of the universal Santa Claus, it is original and full of fun, warmth, and most importantly motivation for us to be more human, kind, and never lose hope to be good people. Because no matter how bad your situation is, helping others and see happiness in their faces is the best (and easiest) thing anyone can ever do."
65,...Klaus would have been Beyonce.But they didn't and that's great.
66,"""Klaus"" contains everything a high quality animated film should contain. From the beginning of the story , the plot seems interesting and different. Throughout the whole film, humour follows every scene and we come up with some really touching scenes. It is so clever that we can see many of the Christmas traditions taking place with a different point of view. I recommend it for every family , especially during Christmas. Excellent work from the Netflix team!"
67,No Christmas qualifier here. Just one of my favorite movies period. Excellent story and animation. My wife does 3d animation and I usually get to hear about all the mistakes or shortfalls in animated movies and she didn't say one thing the entire film. Excellent character growth all around. The story is a classic but it is an original take with a bittersweet semi ambiguous ending that leaves the idea of santa Klaus up to the viewer. At it's heart it is a story about giving and selflessness which is the core of the season for many people. Cannot recommend this film enough.
68,Thank you Netflix for such an amazing movie. The animation was something I saw for the first time and loved it. The story was good and the message and lesson it gave especially to young children was good.
69,"I cried, I laughed.. This movie was so enjoyable.. Watched it 2 times already.. I think that grownups will enjoy it more!
Loved it!!!!"
70,"I can not remember the last time I gave my true compliment to a movie, let alone an animation. Years I have been bragging as an expert of movie, and years I have not been amazed. 'Green Book'-- a white savior clich√©. 'Joker'-- Why a movie is of any good if I knew all it had to say before I even see it? Until, I watched'Klaus', one of the best movies in years and one of the best Christmas movie or animation ever made.
For two hours, I couldn't calm myself down from the pure childish joy after surprised and thrilled, multiple times, by this masterpiece. Great original story, solid characters, beautiful music, and an impeccable finish with a brave end.
Decades we've been feeling awful for lying to our children about Santa, and finally we have a real story to tell about a toy maker and his postman friend, and how Christmas truely began. This movie was like fresh chilling breeze in the Christmas morning bringing us, those who were exhausted and frustrated by the fight and fraud in our adult life, deep down to the good kids we once were. A true act of good will always sparks another. Hope this inspire."
71,"Just finished watching this beautiful movie. It will for sure join my family's selective list of Christmas Classics. Amazing animation, voice acting. A beautiful story that will left you feeling warm inside. Really wish Netflix would have done a Movie theater release. This movie also deserves to be seen in the big screen."
72,A perfectly original take on the classic origin of sending letters to Santa Claus.
73,As a 24 year old male I did not expect to cry at this film yet here we are. But I don't even care what a film. Go on Netflix
74,"I didn't expect from Netflix
Movie really very very good."
75,Absolutely fascinating! Graphics and storyline fantastic! Beautiful film thank you.
76,"What a beautiful and heartfelt animation. One of the best, if not the best, animated Christmas film of all time. I was smiling and tearing up at the same time throughout. Watch it, please."
77,"This is by far the best Christmas movie I've seen made in a long, long time. Its beautiful old-school animation and story telling that you just don't see much anymore. All I can say Is well done!"
78,"Such a beautiful, life-affirming movie. Cant wait to watch it again and again with my children."
79,"I am essentially The Grinch. But. This movie... It is simply amazing. By simple I mean simple. The success is in the effortless, no frills, magically, eanly animated, expertly directed end result. Simply superb."
80,"The directorial debut of Sergio Pablos Klaus is an animated Christmas film that is bound to draw a smile across your face, warm your spirit, grab your attention hooking it to the screen and perhaps even find your eyes a bit glassy in more than several instances!First thing is first the animation is incredible; it looks like a beautiful marriage of 2D and 3D animation with each character flowing and moving with weight and substance in their actions and amazing facial expressions. Speaking of the characters each one has a unique design and feel that will stick in your mind and leave you in awe at the amount of effort put into everyone from the main characters to the smallest supporting ones. And the art style is reminiscent of an old story book you read while warming yourself by the fireplace fostering an impeccable atmosphere from scene to scene. While this might be Mr. Pablos' directorial debut he has an impressive resume of having a hand in animated properties and him and his team clearly have love and passion for the medium as they breathed life into this project from start to finish.Each character in this tale also has the phenomenal ability to emotionally connect and resonate their feelings with the viewer sometimes without saying a single word! With their voice actors delivering a multitude of expressive and emotive language that fit each of them excellently! From Postman Jesper finding himself in a miserable hopeless situation to discovering not only his own worth but the true happiness and warmth of life he never knew he had been denying himself. From fish merchant/ school teacher Alva trying to escape a hopeless situation of her own but slowly opening herself back up to the passion that widened her eyes and brought her smile to the surface even with the chance she might be hurt again for dreaming. From Woodsman Klaus just drifting through life keeping busy with craftsmanship in the hopes of not dwelling on the loss of a piece of him that made him complete and a future he was not able to have; to being able to reignite the light within him that she always fostered and grew with her warmth that never truly left him in the first place.While some of the story might tread on familiar territory it still has the advantage of being set in a time without current day references or catch phrases that would be sure to date it. Making this a timeless film that you can watch with your children, grand children for many Christmas seasons to come. And even if you do not celebrate Christmas it is a project so well put together that you cannot help but appreciate and resonate with it! So do not just take my word for it see yourself and spread it to those you love and even those you do not love who knows what new bonds of friendship could be fostered by taking such a chance!I for one hope it is successful for I would love to see more animated works from this team in the near future without a single doubt in my mind because this is art; art in motion! Thank you for hearing me out and remember;A true act of goodwill always sparks another ^-^"
81,"This movie is an outstanding one.I firstly saw it on Netflix but never wanted to watch it, because of how disappointed I was by other attempts on creating a good christmas movie. After one of my favourite YouTubers recommended it, I thought to give it a chance. It was the best choice I ever made.
So, here are my points of criticism.1. Story 20/20The story is the most important part in a movie. Klaus has an outstanding storyline, which combines a classic Christmas story with an original one. I really loved the idea to put a Mailman as the protagonist to give the story a different taste and twist. Not going to spoil the movie though, just so you know, great story!2. Animation 20/20This movie's animation is incredible. I was blown away by the art style and the 3D ffect though lightning. Really clever way of combining a rather oldschool drawing style movie and also combine it with modern technology. Great job. And ever since Disney complitely gave up on animations and started focusing on real life dramatory, I found this movie to be the perfect ""New Disney"" kind of movie. Awesome work.
PS. If you are an animation/art lover, make sure to watch a few videos on the animation of the movie. You will thank me for that.3. Music 20/20
Not much to say in there. The music was just great and fitted to the movie itself. You know how much of an impact the sound actually has, so no surprises that they got it so damn right.4. Voice Acting 20/20The voice actors in the Movie ""Klaus"" were all amazing and fitted to the character really well. They were all loud and clear and I could watch the movie in English, without subtitles (ENG is not my native language)5. Christmas Mood 20/20When watching a Christmas movie, you want to get that vibe, that ""yes! Its Christmas, the best time of the year!""
Through the original storyline, the great animation, the music and the voice acting, I can promise you, that after watching this movie, you will feel like it is Christmas tomorrow. Great way of getting the viewer into the right mood,Overall points: 100/100If you read this after watching the movie, then great. If you have not watched the movie yet, do this like right now. Trust me. If you hate it, you can freely comment down here and I am going to be pleased to talk with you about it."
82,"Not only does this film look like a Christmas Card, it generates the same emotions. In an age where kindness, decency, and selflessness are mocked and derided; this movie chooses to be sweet yet ultimately meaningful, and poignant. It has been a while since I have watched a Christmas movie and felt like it was truly about the goodness that the season is supposed to be about.
Anyone looking for a good Christmas movie, or a movie that will make them feel, should look into finding a way to view ""Klaus."""
83,"Loved this from beginning to end. Just the right combination of humour, brevity, realism and magic. Loved how the origin of Santa Claus is imagined, it's carefully told and brilliantly animated. It's not showy, it's not overly worthy or trying to be too cool. Big thanks to all the voice actors who bring their animated characters to life so naturally, and big thanks to all the animators who brought the voices to life so effectively. Great little touches of contemporary music here and there. Tears were shed. We'll be watching it every Christmas from now on."
84,"Exquisite animation, well-rounded characters and compelling storytelling all make this a wonderful experience for anyone, child or adult. I especially enjoyed how the animation rendered the sunrises and disks in an otherwise dank, grey town. Definitely going on my annual holiday movie list."
85,"A must watch. This film is amazing, creative, sweet, engaging, everything! I really believe this is the best Christmas film I've ever seen! I wish they had it on DVD just so I could get it for my collection, even though it's on Netflix anyways!"
86,"With complete confidence I can say this film is an instant classic.The characters are perfectly put together and have fantastic development throughout the film. The script is engaging and funny, while the soundtrack completely compliments the film.All of this is encapsulated in breathtaking animation.You simply must watch it, you will love it."
87,"I honestly can't express the pure childish joy i felt throughout watching this movie. It's got enough of the highs as lows. It's got alot more humor, then i thought, for the older audience as well! The animation is some of the best i've ever seen in a move. There is so much love and though put into every single secound of this film. The visuals itself is enough to make to want more. This is a movie i will watch over and over again. I loved it."
88,"This movie is a breath of fresh air with beautiful animation, fantastic lovable characters and, an entirely original Christmas story that doesn't feel stale. it is THE perfect holiday movie of the year(maybe of all time). Definitely a fantastic Christmas movie for the entire family! Highly recommend"
89,"Imo this legit is one of the best animated holiday movies made. I loved it very much. I wont say more than my opinion, and that I really recommend you give this a watch."
90,Great story and very good animation thankx netfelx
91,Music score and characters which are potrait in the movie is awesome. Getting into detailing of Santa in this movie is icing on the cake. Worth watchüëçüëç
92,"After years I've finally registered on IMDb just to give this piece of art a 10/10!Thank you to all who created this masterpiece of storytelling, characters, colors, light, and music."
93,"This movie moved me in ways i could never ever begin to describe, right now i want to do good and help people more than i ever thought i would. This brought back numerous childhood memories and it mde me feel like a seven year old boy who was watching his most favorite cartoon, Klaus has less lines than Jesper but every line he has is so profound, and even though i hoped for a little more magic i realized that it doesn't matter and that Klaus is wonderful origin story, and perhaps the best santa origin story EVER!"
94,"Once a year, for Christmas, I'll try to watch this movie, like I do for Nightmare Before Christmas.
It's just amazing. Go watch it. The animation is stunning, the humor is great, the movie is inventive and its story is too!"
95,This was such a surprise but yet such a delight. It is such a warm and beautiful story that you must watch.
96,"Had no idea what to expect about this movie, I like animated movies because of my background as a 3D designer and content creator. The movie showed up on my start page on Netflix and decided to give it a try, after 10 minutes I was hooked untill the end credits. This reminded me of corpse bride in a way but way more interesting story line (even though I love corpse bride). Absolutely loved the visuals of this movie, it's gorgeous. If you have netflix, this is a must see for all in the holidays.. You can't miss this."
97,"I was bored on a Saturday evening, and I thought to give it a shot !
Best decision I ever made ! Extraordinary movie!
Made a believer out of me!
This movie is worth 100/10!"
98,"I really loved the movie. Really well-executed, inspiring movie. Even the ending was awesome."
99,"Really heartwarming, funny, artistically beautiful , creative and fresh plot and storyline, so much emotion. Its my family's new a must watch Christmas family movie every year now !"
100,"It will be one of my best movies forever, it's just so cozy and full of emotions. peace, giving and love. It tills us that there's always good things into our hearts, we just have to look for it. Thank you for all the positive feelings that you gave to me"
101,"Best animation and satisfied movie of november. If you are bored of other animation then u should watch this and you will feel diffrent.Basically this movie is all about a plump guy which we called santa claus.It shows how santa claus began.Just his back story and why he started to gave a gift to children.The background score is good.The character jesper and klaus,they both are just like friends.Watch this before christmas or on christmas eve."
102,"Simply genious. The animation is amazing and the plot even better, top-quality writing right here!! ahahah"
103,Fantastic and authentic story. This is the type of movie Disney should be making more often
104,"I think it is the best Christmas movie I saw, it is funny, tender and beautiful.
I almost ended in tears.
and the end is splendid."
105,"Wether you know who is the man this story is about or not, whether you think this is a historical or fictional story. One thing is for sure and that is you are going to have this fine post-movie sensation and will actually be happy with the adventure of this HERO."
106,"I've seen many comments that say that film was too dark and scary for their children and also it's not a proper story about Santa Claus.
Firstly, as an adult who adores animations I really liked the movie because it doesn't really focus on christmas. It's also a film about the senselessness of discrimination and how the people so connected to the old traditions are trying to make continue this nonsense. Actually, when I was watching the film I understood how the discrimination and hatred among the different groups pass from old generations to new ones. But I also realized that how easy is it to break the walls and prejudices among us with a couple of simple act of kindness.So it's not just a meaningless christmas movie as some people might say. Also the animations and the dubbing is very good. Hence, I recommend this movie to anyone who would like to watch an entertaining and meaningful movie."
107,It makes me tears on my eyes. best movie ever. must watch it.
108,"''A true selfless act always sparks another.''
I haven't cried this much watching an animated movie since Tangled probably. Amazing animation. Perfect soundtrack. Needless to say my new favourite Christmas movie."
109,"I was really disappointed that this film did not win the Oscars for Animated Film. Normally continental European movies are 90% awful, and even their famous directors like Pedro Almodovar, Luc Besson, Gaspar No√©, Bernardo Bertolucci, Carlos Saura love making movies that shock us and make us feel bad.For example, La Femme Nikita is an excelent movie, but gives us the idea that it is cool to kill police officers (who are always dehumanized), or 1900 which portrays insanity as something bold (like a peasant chop his own ear to show his boss that he is insulted). So with a mentality like that, which all those movies are incredibly cynical and nihilist, portraying people as creatures that are only motivated by illegal drugs, bozarre sex and destruction of any trace of civilization or good manners. I have watched dozens of those flics and they all end making us feel pessimistic about the world.For example, Pan's Labyrinth is also very entertaing, but it creates the narrative of good guys (communist partisans) versus sadistic bad guys (the Spanish government, represented by its soldiers). So in the end they insert unnecessary political messages.That is why Klaus is so different. An entire Spaniard production, they rescue some values from our Western civilization, that are so rejected by the media, but deep inside many of us, we miss those traditions, and many lf those previosly rebels, non conformists actually pass on the rituals of Christmas despite all the opposition that wants to desecrate one of our core Holidays.The movie is not religious at all, but a the same time doesn't fall into the American trap of making the movie gringey and disrespectful.
And I was surprised that people in Scandinavia actually looked like they were from there (different than Hollywood now casting actors who clearly don't belong and make it awkward). That gave me hope that the movie industry still has directors capable of delivering pleasant content.The large number of views , considering that Christmas is boycotted by Jews, Muslims, Atheists, Seculars/Agnostics, East Asians, Hindus and Sikhs prove that there is a public that appreciate family friendly films, influenced by Western traditions, and shown in an uplifting way. Imhope more will come."
110,"This Santa Claus origin movie is awesome! It's heartwarming, original (for the most part, there were some elements that reminded me a little of The Emperor's New Groove or Megamind), funny and the animation is amazing! If I could describe it, well, do you remember the Disney short Paperman? You know, the one where they shaded CGI animation to make it look hand-drawn? Well, Klaus is the opposite. It's hand-drawn animation that is shaded to look like CGI. I've never seen this style before and it looks great! It's so colourful and well-designed. The voice acting and the writing is really damn good too! Honestly, there are only a couple issues I have. Some of the music choices and what little CGI this movie does use seem out-of-place, but other than that this might be the best Christmas movie since Arthur Christmas. It's certainly the year's best animated movie, and the best animated movie in general since Into the Spider-verse. Give it a watch with the family, it's really delightful!"
111,"Klaus is an amusing new twist on a very old story. It's a heart-warming tale with an uplifting message about kindness, featuring beautifully unique animation, interesting characters, and a clever plot. In the sea of generic Christmas movies that get churned out each holiday season, Klaus stands out because it tried something different and it succeeded."
112,"Netflix has produced yet another instant film ciassic, this time in the form of a Christmas movies, of all things. For a genre that you think you've seen it all, Klaus (2019) does the unique task of rewriting the origin story of ""Klaus"" and the result is a breathtaking, beautiful piece of animation. Wonderful hand-drawn 2D animation (that will surely bring any 90s kid back to their childhood), incredible music and top-notch voice acting. It's all executed incredibly well and is surely one of the best Christmas films ever made!"
113,"A secular Christmas classic, beautiful picture, funny and charming"
114,"The Netflix platform once again proves to be a sanctuary for creativity and artistic soul, giving us a fine Spanish film that resembles the sort of Disney fairy tale that Disney would no longer dare to make, with animation that resembles Atlantis: The Lost Empire, and a protagonist reminiscent of the selfish Emperor Cuzco. Add to that some stylistically distinct backgrounds (fusing CGI and traditional animation with loving care), wonderful color schemes, and a moving message about the true meaning of Christmas, et voila: the best animation of the year.Klaus, the first animated Netflix original feature, does fall into a few of the traps that modern kiddie films tend to. There are a few ""hip"" music choices (God knows this movie did not need Zara Larsson), ham-fisted bits of commentary, and a ""Liar Revealed"" clich√© with all the misunderstanding and moping that must follow (albeit with some self-awareness). However, this scarcely ruins what it is otherwise a timeless film that already feels like a poignant holiday classic.We meet Jesper Johannsen (Jason Schwartzman), a spoiled and lazy postman-in-training from some unspecified Scandinavian country, whose wealthy father, owner of the postal service, sees through his deliberate self-sabotaging and puts him in a position that even a slob like him is qualified for: delivering mail on the secluded Arctic island of Smeerensburg (should he fail, he will be disowned). It is a cold, foggy, and socially divided place, where the dark-haired Krum family, headed by a spindly Joan Cusack, is in constant conflict with the red-haired Ellingboes, headed by Will Sasso. Each clan's hatred toward the other's differences is so integral to their family tradition that, as both sides unanimously explain, ""tradition"" is the only reason they still do it. I got the hint early on, but the film gets a little obvious.Another inhabitant of Smeerensburg is a mysterious, woodcarving hermit named Klaus (J.K. Simmons), who accidentally ends up receiving the only ""mail"" Jesper gets to deliver: a small child's drawing. Nevertheless, Jesper is given a package from the enigmatic recluse to deliver to the child in return. And soon, word spreads throughout Smeerensburg that Klaus will deliver a handcrafted toy if sent a letter; suddenly, children of all hair colours are bonding over a unifying myth. The film is functionally a ""Santa Claus origin story"" and they explain some of his well-known hallmarks in amusing ways.Klaus in the hausJesper also begins to change, and he meets yet more notable townsfolk. A woman named Alva (Rashida Jones) was sent to Smeerensburg to be the school teacher, but since tradition dictates that the gingers can't very well receive education alongside the black-haired kiddies, she was forced to convert the classroom to a fish shop. The wisecracking sailor Mogens (Norm MacDonald) guides Jesper through this strange society early on. A small Saami girl appears from time to time, clearly not there to squabble in the name of neither Krum nor Ellingboe.These characters are all enjoyable and - unless they're only there to supply slick, fast-paced slapstick or memorably hilarious expressions, which is fine - go through endearing arcs. Klaus finds new meaning in life when, despite past tragedies and losses, he gets to leave an impression on those around him with his creativity. The selfish Jesper initially spreads the rumor of Klaus' workshop to advance his own career and deliver more mail, but he discovers that a certain spirit he helped bring to the island means more to him than getting to leave. Alva goes through a similar change, inspiring Jesper.Although flawed at some points, Klaus gets it right in several important ways. Its animation is well-paced (shifting seamlessly between intense physical comedy and silent atmosphere), its backgrounds are unique (if occasionally Burton-inspired), its lighting is perfectly utilized, and its message is timeless on top of being just in time for the annual ""Christmas in November"", communicated through likable characters and how they grow. If I must make one last complaint, it is that we see hints of Jesper becoming jealous that everyone's talking about Klaus when Jesper is the one making the nightly deliveries. This (please forgive me) goes snow-where.It is funny, I think, that those who are most similar to the antagonists of this film are often protective of a given version of Christmas, insisting there's a war‚Ñ¢ on it, thus countering the unifying magic that this film confirms it ought to have. Is Klaus realistic in this regard; the power it believes Christmas to have in divisive times? I've been among humans too long to surely say yes. But it is hopeful in a way we all need this holiday season. For many children, this will be their Nightmare Before Christmas. I am at peace with this."
115,This movie is fantastic! It's sure to be a Christmas classic. It definitely has become one in our home!
116,"This movie touched my soul like long time ago disney movies did. Thank you for this. Finaly once again a good, drawn, 2d movie with a good story and not that pixar animation. Really enjoyed it. <3"
117,"A hand drawn masterpiece. Surprisingly one of the best films of 2019. Every frame is so carefully drawn with such care. Usually these animation projects fall for the same clich√©s and sob stories. But this was a heartwarming story without needing to rely on the cheap tactics most animated films use. Excellent writing and simply excellent filmmaking. One of the best animated films i'v ever seen, a Christmas Classic. Bravo Netflix"
118,A touching story about the power of kindness. I loved it.
119,The most beautiful story about Santa ever made! Perfect for kids.
120,Amazing and enjoyable characters .Wonderful story.Full of mixed emotions.the song is perfect to this story amazing music and performance by Zara Larson.sure you will feel happy after watching.
121,"The Holiday season is upon us! It slowly creeps into our collective unconscious throughout November until Thanksgiving is over then BAM its everywhere. Netflix is a little ahead of the game as it just released one it's now yearly holiday features, Klaus.
Plot: B+ (88/100)
Klaus in fact doesn't center around the titular character, but a postman, Jesper, who befriends Klaus and helps him delivers toys to a town in the midst of a generations long feud between families. At it's heart Klaus is a rom-com with the aforementioned Jesper and the titular Klaus, the two shouldn't work well together but they do, antics ensue and Klaus has a falling out with Jesper, who has to prove his worth.
Klaus is adorable in it's simplicity and it works. The backdrop of the family feud helps the town be just a touch more miserable so the hope Jesper & Klaus bring is that much more uplifting. Klaus' story only stumbles during the falling out moment we mentioned before but the act turns so quickly it is more than forgiven!Performances: A (94/100)
Jason Schwartzman steels the film as the lead, voicing Jesper. Schwartzman portrays the arrogance & pity when needed, His performance centers the whole picture and is the emotional crux the picture balances on.
Rashida Jones from Parks & Rec. fame lends her voice to Jesper's love interest & the town teacher Alva. Even more so than Schwartzman Jones disappears into the role.
J.K. Simmons voices Klaus and.... does well but the character doesn't have enough to say to particularly stand out. When he has to add gravitas to a scene he does but those moments are few and far between.
All and all the cast is more than serviceable, Joan Cusack & Will Sasso also appear and are all outstanding, just completely overshadowed by Schwartzmann.Animation: A+ (98/100)
Just WOW, I won't pretend to be an expert in computer animation but the animation is stunning. I believe it's some form of cell shading but done with added textures that completely enhance the experience. I watched it from my home and couldn't help but stare at the beautiful shots. Everything feels like it could have been hand animated and there is always something going on.Final Grade: A (94/100 ~ 280/300)
Klaus is by no means perfect, but is so wholesome we can't help but love it. It's minor flaws are surface problems at best and were overshadowed by magical performances. More than once a tear came to my eye because of just how sincere the feature is. While it is a Christmas movie, it comes off almost completely non denominational & we believe it should be able to be enjoyed by nearly anybody with a heart.Please remember that Film, Television, & all art is completely SUBJECTIVE. Do not let this, or any review stop you from enjoying or seeking out any product."
122,"I cannot believe how well done this film is from beginning to the tearful ending. I have not clapped at an animated feature in a long time. The story, music, animation style and every other detail was so well done. The animation style really gave the characters real emotion. This was the best artistic telling of Santa's origin I have ever seen. Wow, wow and wow!"
123,This is one of my new favourite Christmas films. The characters are lovable and the story line is amazing.
124,"I usually don't like the whole Christmas thing
but.. this movie is simply beautiful."
125,"It was a great experience watching this one, top-notch animation, story and illustration."
126,"For 100 years, I have not looked at something so soulful. For some reason, an analogy was drawn with the French film Bobro neighing - an excellent comedy, I recommend you will not regret it!
Cartoon must-see"
127,"If this movie doesn't make you cry you're getting coal in your stocking for Christmas. Netflix knocks it out of the park in this Instant Christmas Classic. You will laugh, you will smile so hard your cheeks hurt, then you'll tear up from the genuine feels this movie gives you."
128,"People are calling this a new classic and I agree, great story!"
129,"Just happened to watch this on a whim and boy was it worth it. Fantastic animation, great story, some comedy and a sleigh full of heart. Some things borrowed from the classic Rankin Bass production of Santa Claus is Coming to Town, but very original in its own way. Very enjoyable."
130,"A near perfect animated holiday film. The modernized classic animation style is reminiscent of Disney's classic ""The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"".From musical score to script, Netflix has created a magical new world, with likeable characters, beautiful scenery and an engaging story that checks all the boxes: adventure, humour and heart.I'm obsessed. More please."
131,"I went into this movie whitout knowing what it was, with my 2 year old. She satt still for the entire movie, and she never does that. Recomend it to everybody"
132,"Absolutely fabulous story, brilliant writing, heartwarming narrative & delightful adventure to begin the season. Best Holiday animation ever! Bravo! Loved it!"
133,This was such a beautiful reimagination of the origins of Santa Claus. The characters were modern but they still retained that touch of traditionalism that is associated with the sentiments of Christmas. I loved the animiation and music choice in this film and I was very pleasantly surprised at how much I truly enjoyed this Christmas movie. It's a must watch for everyone!
134,"The bulk of holiday movies, especially Christmas movies, are notoriously bad and fall victim to just awful... everything.Klaus manages to take what would otherwise be a predictable story and make it enjoyable.It might take a second viewing - perhaps the bar is simply too low when it comes to Christmas movies. But the fact that there is a desire of a second viewing at all speaks wonders.There is magic out there. And Klaus makes you believe in it."
135,"Expected nothing going into this film, left feeling amazed after one of the best holiday movies ever. Must watch."
136,"I would have never expected a Christmas story to appeal to me as they are usually generic and boring since the original Grinch came out. This comes incredibly close to being as good as that golden oldy.
Absolutely stunning job with this one."
137,"I am literally out of words, what a beautiful, wonderful, joyful, touching movie. With amazing work, dialogues, songs and moments. It's one of the best Christmas movies i surely have seen which carries so much in it. It's a complete wow for the start and wont let you stop till the very end.
Must and a very must watch for everyone."
138,"Traditionally animated films have become far and few in recent years, so whenever a new one comes out, it gets immediate buzz from animation enthusiasts waiting for the next big innovative change in the media. One film that got said attention is Klaus, a modern retelling of the Santa Claus myth from Sergio Pablos, creator of Despicable Me and Smallfoot. Partially made at his Spanish facilities SPA Studios and released on Netflix (in addition to select theaters) this month, the movie itself is a perfect example of a decent film that was unfortunately tainted by overhype.The plot revolves around a postman named Jesper who is stationed in the Northern town of Smeerensburg, which is overrun with hatred from the conflicting Krums and Ellingboes. While in need to sending letters to meet a quota, he befriends a reclusive toy-maker and then slowly finds the true meaning of good will towards all. From that description alone reveals the film's weakest element: the story. The plot has been done before and has so many cliches spread out just to keep it going, from the main character becoming more accepting of the big changes in his life, to the main relationships starting off rocky before gaining the right trust, to an obvious love interest who changes her mind on how to live, and even the whole liar revealed arc. It doesn't help that Jesper is kind of unlikable during the first half due to his petty behavior and egocentric sardonicism, making him hard to connect to until he learns more about the meaning of hospitality. As a result, the feature lacks much surprises and is very predictable from start to finish.With all that said though, the one saving grace in the film's narrative is the overall heart. As the film details the act of good will towards people to lead better lives, it feels very earnest in its intent on doing selfless acts for the greater good of those who you befriended. That actually leads into the character of Klaus himself, who may seem like the average stoic woodsman with a softness hidden within, but his origins give more depth and substance than most renditions of Santa Claus before him, making him a great example of performing deeds through generosity and kindness. Speaking of the other characters, Alva and Mogens offer a good amount of spunk and sarcasm to make their appearances at least enjoyable, but the villains Krum and Ellingboe lack any originality past their hellbent wishes to keep their old hate field traditions. The most distinctive character in the film is Margu, a young Saami girl who acts more as the cutesy admirer of Jesper and Klaus since she wishes to help carry out the spirit of Christmas through means of goodwill to her heroes.Now even though the film may be underwhelming in terms of story, at least the animation makes the experience worthwhile. With a lot of talented character animators on board, they breathed a lot of life in the characters through strong acting and appealing designs. Their cute and cartoony designs blend in well with the cool and somberly colorful environments, which look like they came straight out of a children's book. There are shots in the film that feel like pure concept art, with flat albeit rich textures, soothing scenery and angular proportions that are fun to view. In addition to the animators, the film's cast like Jason Schwartzman, J.K. Simmons, Rashida Jones and Joan Cusack gave more personality and spontaneity to their characters than the generic plot ever could. Finally, the music score by Alfonso Aguilar is very pleasing and calming given the feature's intentional sweet nature, but some of the song choices are flat out stupid. The end song is ok as far as routine pop songs go, but did we need to hear an out of place rap song in an otherwise rich looking Nordic tale?So Klaus may not have been the next big hand-drawn film we were all looking for due to its weak story and hit or miss characters, but at least the colorful animation, charming voice acting and message of good will can offer something in return. Personally, I feel like this is best suited for children, because they'll gain a lot more from this growing up then most adults and teenagers would; it could be their first time learning about why we must care for one another. In this world consumed by hate, greed and cynicism, at least we have beacons like this to remind us why we live and breathe."
139,"Jesper is a selfish and lazy young man. And, to teach him a lesson, his father sends him to work as a postman in the hellish Scandinavian town of Smeerensburg. Why is the place so bad? It's incredibly unfriendly and gray....with locals constantly feuding with each other for generations. And, considering the locals can't stand each other, no one ever wants to write a letter....and Jesper has absolutely nothing to do but count the days until he can leave the place!
One evening, a dark and scary stranger, Mr. Klaus, shows up and demands that Jesper delivers a present to one of the kids in town. Over time, the traditional Santa myth is created in the story--with kids writing letters to Santa Klaus, reindeer and the whole kiboodle. But what about Jesper? His time to leave is approaching...and he's actually doing so much good.This is a gorgeously animated and beautiful film. I loved the combination of CGI and traditional animation and the story kept my interest because it had heart and was occasionally rather funny. Well worth seeing and clearly a reimagining of the Christmas special from 19970, ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town""."
140,"Netflix got into the Animated Christmas Spirit this year releasing ""Klaus"" an origin story about Santa Klaus starring J.K. Simmons, Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, Joan Cusack and Norm MacDonald.The film is Sergio Pablos' directorial debut. You may know some of his previous work as a writer for ""Despicable Me,"" and working in the animation department on other classics like ""Rio,"" ""Tarzan,"" ""Treasure Planet"" and others.The film has a beautiful 2D aesthetic harkening back to the classics of yesteryear. The animation is fresh and visually pleasing. The stylistic depictions accentuate the story of the town of Smeerensburg (essentially the North Pole) and its Hatfield-vs-McCoy inhabitants feuding for the sake of feuding.The story follows Jesper (Schwartzman), a mailman with his final chance to prove to his father he can hack it before he is cut off from his cushy existence. By chance, Jesper happens upon Klaus (Simmons), a woodsman and toymaker in a previous life, who has only ever wanted to see his toys bring joy to little children. The final piece are the children who would love nothing more than to have a brand new toy to play with. The three pieces like cogs in a clock work together to birth the Santa Klaus mythologies as needy kids begin receiving their presents.As the film progresses a main theme emerges, ""a true, selfless act always sparks another."" A kind of ""love wins"" over the neverending feuds and backward traditions that have persisted here for so long. The acts of giving to one another results in new bonds formed and old differences fading away.It is a wonderful message to attach to Christmas for children and adults alike. It is, after all, God's gift of His son Jesus, the reason we celebrate Christmas."
141,"In my culture, there is no Santa Klaus, we have the ""Christkind"". Doesn't matter, this movie is beautiful on so many levels.The animation-style is very unique and incredinly atmospheric, but what really stands out in this movie is its impeccable message of bringing joy to other peoples lives, even if its just little things, and how it can change their lives entirely.A must watch for Christmas-movie-fans, but also a must-watch for anyone who is searching for a beautifully emotional movie."
142,"The film suddenly plunged me back into childhood. Thank you, authors, for this magnificent adventure."
143,"""Klaus"" is beyond a Christmas animation movie. I started watching it as a professional. As an animator i decided to watch it for the new techniques they used for creating it, but soon i forgot to follow what and how they did it. I was immersed in this amazing world that was created on screen. I was again a little girl watching a fairy tale. Everything from the story, trough the character and background designs, music score and the new techniques that were used for creating this animation makes it a masterpiece.
In times when the big animation film studios are too busy with corporate stuff and merchandising and broadcasting everything they spit, Sergio Pablos and his studio ""Spa Stuidios"" with the help of Netflix create an actual good animation movie. A movie which is not all about political correctness, but a animation for THE CHILDREN. A pure joy for the viewers, a movie that pretty much resembles the old animation classics. So thank you Sergio Pablos for bringing back the joy of watching animations! Thank you for bringing back the 2D animation to life. And thank you Netflix for believing in this project and make it possible."
144,"I must say, this is one of the best animated Christmas movie I have ever seen, if not THE best."
145,"What a beautiful story about the fat man we all know and love. This a beautiful story that shows friendship, hardship and even trials. The main character Jesper is a failing post man who gets sent through a trial to become the post man his father always believed he could be. But he stumbles upon an old run down house which is owned by Klaus. They both find the love and passion for giving instead of getting. This movie is about the birth of Santa Klaus, from the gifts to the naughty and nice list etc. this movie just explores it all and in a such a great way too. This movie really warmed up my heart, it's been a long time since we got a good old Christmas movie, and this film delivered. There is a sad part at the end of the movie which creates the imagination of Santa Klaus that children still believe in today. He comes every year, so you best be in bed."
146,My new all time favourite!! A must see every Christmas from now on!
147,"I recommend this movie too everyone, it has everything Christmas it supposed too mean, it's simply good."
148,"Klaus is a spirited and artful take on the Santa Claus mythos and the best animated film of the year. As a follower of this project for the past 4 years, it was everything I hoped it would be: A deeply effective balance of raw storytelling and unique visual wonder. I appreciate that it's not a religious take on the folk figure. This origin story is driven completely by character, emotion and the simple act of giving, deftly balancing humor and heart with warm and thoughtful results. That's how every Christmas-themed film should be and Klaus nails it.The animation is superb, each character looks and moves distinctly and there's a pitch perfect cast to bring them to life. The environments are simply gorgeous; eccentrically built, yet cool and atmospheric all the same. My only nitpicks are the brief inclusions of licensed music, but they don't last too long and actually kinda had me chuckling, but it still harms the film's integrity and could've gone on fine without those forced moments.In an era where traditional animation is underappreciated and barely viable, Klaus is the last bastion of that classic style and even kinda raises the bar for it. It deserves to be known about and I hope it spearheads a new generation of animated holiday classics...and brings traditionally animated films back to the public eye. Watch it on Netflix. It's a delight. So sweet and genuine and completely from the heart. I won't dare say more."
149,"Jesper, a trainee postman, comes from a privileged background and is determined to coast through life. However, his father, the postmaster-general, has other ideas. He sends Jesper to the furthest-flung post office in the country and issues him with an ultimatum: process 6,000 letters in a year or he is cut off from the family fortune. Upon arrival, Jesper finds that the town has been drawn into a bitter feud between two rival families. He also finds a strange, scary old man, Klaus.A children's Christmas movie, and not much more. The plot had potential, as it tells how Santa Claus and the traditions and legends surrounding him came into being. The way the writers weave these into the movie is fairly interesting and entertaining.However, the rest is, for the most part, quite predictable and hum drum, consisting of your usual child-focused hijinks and the like. The fact that the ""hero"", Jesper, is an unlikable slacker doesn't help the engagement level either.This said, there is a sweetness and innocence to the movie that make up for general ordinariness of proceedings. The sub-plot involving the little girl who couldn't speak English was particularly heart-warming.Overall, the sweetness and message tip the movie into the ""liked"" basket."
150,"My title tells all you need to know.
Netflix release this in theaters all over the world next year. Make it a bargain, give everyone ( who doesn't already subscribe) a Christmas present"
151,"A modern hand draw animated film beautifully made. The story is so wholesome, I loved it.
Also, it's refreshing to see an animated movie that's not trying to be progressive or make a political statement. Just a good story. Thanks Sergio Pablos!"
152,"I do not typically like Christmas movies, but this one was really good and a pleasure to watch.Without revealing too much, the underlying story is not very original per see, but the way it was put, and the way the invention of Santa Claus evolves is actually quite innovative and moving.That said, this is a movie that you really should watch with your kids. It did for sure put a smile in my face and theirs as well. I highly recommend it. One of Netflix's best movies without a doubt."
153,"First I thought it might be just a cartoon which full of fairytale.At first the movie is boring.From the 25 minutes, it took to the end of movie that didn't allow to stop watching.It had a nice story about Xmas and character development is slowly become.
This animation is worth to watch.It didn't make me regret for watch this."
154,Good story nice adaption awesome characters superb animation and art. Sure thing to watch this Christmas season.
155,Don't know what to say & how much to write..but it is just wow! Perfect movie.
156,"One must be brave to re-write the story of an almost universal character like Santa Claus, but Klaus takes on the challenge with cunning, sympathy and humor."
157,My 17 year old son introduced me to this movie. We have a Christmas tradition of watching certain movies over and over on a holiday rotation and we have a new one!! This movie is just amazing. Entertaining and sends such a simple message that I wish we could all hold on too. Animation is fun and endearing and the voices are perfect!! Will watch again and again happily each year!!
158,A heartwarming story for kids & their parents. A must watch in christmas holidays 2019 and all the following years.
159,"Easily a new Christmas Classic. The traditional animation is incredibly well crafted, the visual gags bring a smile to every scene, and the characters have so much thought into them you'd believe they were real people speaking on the screen."
160,"This is a beautiful, refreshing story. We loved it. Well done Netflix and everyone involved making this."
161,"Easily a new Christmas Classic.
The traditional animation is incredibly well crafted, the visual gags bring a smile to every scene, and the characters have so much thought into them you'd believe they were real people speaking on the screen.
It's a waste if this movie never comes to DVD. I desperately want to own it at home."
162,"A wonderful, animated Christmas movie. I don't like Christmas movies in general, but this one have everything I could ever want. Parts that make me cry, parts that make me laugh and everything in between. And a fantastic story and good character writing."
163,"I started watching this expecting the typical x-mass fluff. My wife was feeling a bit down so I thought: heck, from the picture this looks like the kind of sugary holiday movie that she might just need.Oh boy did I feel weird for the first 20-25 minutes. Especially during the introduction of Smeerensburg and its dwellers, when I felt like this could take the dark comedy/thriller route very easily. Something like ""Coraline"", while great, was definitely not what we wanted to watch at the moment.But that fear was quickly abated as the mood progressively gets lighter while the story unfolds. I loved the fact that this is nicely captured in the way the animation shifts from the initial dark and icy setting to a warm and fuzzy atmosphere by the end.I also loved the fact that it reminded me a bit of the Brothers Grimm stories I read as a child by not being afraid to hint at more mature/dark elements that drive the story without spoiling the fun by being to dark or explicit. Also, the main characters feel flawed, not in a disney-esque ""let's give the character a big nose or a funny accent"" kind of way but in a more human way. They felt like real, imperfect people as opposed to some 2d idealistic representations.Not sure if this will become a x-mass classic but we will definitely watch it again."
164,"A new take on the Father Christmas story, a moving and heartwarming tale 9/10"
165,"This was exceptionally good. I think it will
Be known as a true Christmas Classic, it's been a while since one came out!"
166,"A simple act of kindness always sparks anotherThe animation is really well done. Looks and feels great. Music is amazing too.Did not expect much from film but was pleasantly surprised. It's a refreshing take on the origin of Santa Claus. While I did enjoy the way legend of Santa Claus was being presented, from the flying sleigh to the naughty list, the most enjoyable part for me was the friendship between Mr. Klaus and Jesper.The only complaint is it is too short.I had a great time with this one. This film somehow reminds me of The Grinch (2018) ."
167,"Klaus is the new animated film on Netflix, which is about how the legend of Santa Claus started involving a reclusive woodsman and a selfish postman. This is a truly inventive, good-hearted Christmas film.The film uses old-fashioned animation with digital techniques to bring a 2 1/2D look to it. This looks AMAZING. I don't think I've seen something quite like this. The painted appearance to the backgrounds and characters looks great. The designs of the characters and locales are all distinctive, especially the characters. There is a wide cast here and they are so stylistically designed. The movie takes place around this town where two clans are at war. The townspeople are such a wonderfully diverse group of grotesques. I also loved the look of Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) who is given a large, broad-shouldered figure. The character movement is also really fluid.The story is equally good. Although the film ultimately goes the way you predict it will, the storytelling in this is so well done that it doesn't much matter. The idea of the story of Santa Claus being told through non-magical reasons and happening through the actions of a postman is definitely something different from most attempts at Santa origin stories. The warring clans part brings a nice dab of dark humor while the sentimental bits are done nicely. All the characters are likable.I highly recommend you check this out. This is just a really well-done family Christmas movie."
168,My 5 year old daughter enjoyed it from start to finish. It's a funny and refreshing storyline with good animation.
169,"Klaus is absolutely wonderful! With breathtaking animation, fantastic humor, hard hitting emotional scenes and a tight script.
I'll highly recommend this to everyone, young or old, in a group or by yourself.
An instant classic."
170,"You better hydrate good before watching, I cried like 9 times"
171,"Kids will love it. Adults as well. Humour, action, love and a good plot. Will watch it again next year before xmas"
172,My new favourite xmas film. Wonderful animation and great cast
173,"I would have never guessed that animated movie from Netflix would be my favorite movie of the year so far but It happened.Klaus is full of charm, great animation, mostly well put together soundtrack (there are 3 songs in the movie that don't really fit) and amusing humor.Story is pretty cliched, but I always believe that cliches don't matter if the movie Is so well done. It's so simple yet effective, showing what kindness can do. My only problem with the story is the liar revealed trope. I have no problem with the other tropes Klaus has, but that one was truly lame and every movie should stop using it or do something a bit more creative than have a characters be annoyed for few minutes. Luckily It doesn't last long and the movie can end on a great noteI truly believe that almost everyone can enjoy this. My favorite movies so far in 2019 have been pretty depressing so It's really refreshing to see a movie this wholesomeFinal score light 9 to strong 8"
174,"About a postman and a toymaker making toys for children in a small island that has 2 families bickering and fighting everyday because reasons.funny, but not cheesy, and also heart warming. A rare to have non-Disney/pixar/warner/sony or any big studio animated movie with this quality this day.recomended"
175,"Perfectly in time for Xmas. Loved the animation, songs, background music."
176,Amazing movie! We laughed and cried tears of joy! Instant CLASSIC!
177,"Fantastic movie and the ending is so warming!
The animation style is so refreshing - well don Netflix!"
178,"I was skeptical when I first saw ads for this movie, but after watching it I can say that this is one of the very few films that has come out in recent years that actually made me happy to watch. It was a refreshing story and not just some rehashed crap from three decades ago or yet another superhero movie being shoved out for a quick cash grab. The setting and characters were charming. The plot was a little linear and predictable at times, but it was enjoyable. Honestly a good movie. The most shocking part is that it's Netflix. Who would have thought?"
179,"I love animation and most of it i love 2d animation and see a movie with a so underfull 2d animation makes my eyes blow away, such a beautiful movie, well written with great characters and a lot of heart!!"
180,"Great Christmas movie for the whole family. Beautifully animated, and funny!"
181,Such a nice story. I am sure my kids will love it.
182,"Fantastic story telling and great animation.
Don't hesitate get this watched you will not regret it.
Great for all ages,and lots of laughs along the way !!
(9/10)."
183,"Who'd have thunk it? The post office is responsible for the existence of Santa Clause and the myths attached to him?
A refreshing take/change on an old story (St. Nick) with humor that holds the attention of adults but a simple enough story to appeal to kids, too.
Some great life lessons about relationships and society - and reemphasizing the most basic axiom of common sense: The Golden Rule (modified here but similar).
Kudos!PS: And, something Which probably won't offend anyone!"
184,Very well written! Which makes all the difference.
185,"This is honestly one of the best animation I've ever seen, one of the best Christmas motion pitcture by far, an amazing, emotional and surprising interpretation of Santa Claus Origin and more...*It felt quite mature as a film*"
186,"Beautiful environment ,with a joyful peaceful calm story for me which I had a very stressful day really good choice for ending my day. I think it shows you anything you want to see about Christmas and and it can also have something to say and has really funny moments with a good graphic and script"
187,"Wonderful movie. Have watched several times now and I'm possibly more enchanted by the unique Xmas story and brilliant animation with each viewing.
Probably like many, started watching this just to pass the time but was quickly involved in the story and intrigued to the Xmas connection.
Several moments had tears streaming down my cheeks (the sled scene crushes me) and laughing out loud on occasion. A charming, sweet movie without ever being sickening at all.
For someone that despises Xmas and the usual dirge that is produced for the holiday season, Kraus was an absolute exception and a must see."
188,"An original animated christmas movie, that's worth the watch!"
189,"I see many reviews saying ""Best Christmas Movie"" or ""Best Santa Origin Story"" and I couldn't agree more, but right now, it's literally 11:11 am on 11/11/2020 and if anyone sees the year, it's been absolutely horrific! This movie just made me feel so good I still cannot stop crying. After the worst year in any memory I've ever had, this movie just made me feel love and peace. Whoever the writers were for this film, award them."
190,"Great version of the Christmas tale about how Santa Claus came to be. It's not really the tale, but it has twists that makes the reader believe. And believe you do! Animation is good; story is well written and clever; voices and characters are great. It's just a cute movie for the whole family. I will probably watch again around Christmas."

192,"This movie.. is really something you wouldn't get every day. It's a really heartwarming story filled with positive and wholesome energy. Gorgeous visuals, very well done character design, great characters and character development. They are all very lovable! The soundtrack wraps everything really well too. The movie is great in making you.. happy.. and also sad at the same time. maybe this is a little bit spoilery?.. but there's a touch of bittersweet in the ending that i really liked. Almost made me cry(i was really close), you should really watch it for yourself. Believe me!I'm just so so glad that this movie reaally gives me hope for the future of hand drawn 2D animation... it's simply breathtaking, and greatly inspiring for someone like me, who is currently studying in animation and film. Huge thanks to netflix for bringing hand drawn animation back into the light. We MISSED those spark of magic created by the human hand. Don't get me wrong, 3D is still an amazing medium, no hate on it, it's just something that everybody does these days. As much as how great it is seeing CGI technology progressed in the industry, I really hope people won't forget hand drawn animation and keep preserving it in the future with new innovations like Klaus did.A SOLID 10/10 from me."
193,"This is a story of an alternate version of the origins of Santa Clause and his gifts. The best part of this movie is its visuals. I don't know how they did it, but they are just breathtaking, even better than some of the Pixar movies.Even though the screen time is around 80 minutes, it still feels a drag sometimes. The dialogues were not that catchy, funny or interesting for me to be engaged thoroughly in the film.The film reaches its zenith with its emotional points and its visuals. Overall a decent watch."
194,"It is a tremendous gem that moves too much, I loved it in a huge way, it is quite warm, humorous and visually beautiful."
195,"Watching Klaus (2019), to me, is not necessarily a completely unique experience. There are sooo many good movies out there telling stories about magical christmas. However, there are still too many things that you will miss by not watching this movie.I won't talk a lot about those things, but basically you will then understand kindness a little deeper than before. You will realize how doing kind things will not just benefit others, but also, it is even more for you.This movie is great to watch with family (especially in christmas eve), with friends, or just simply by yourself. So please, give this movie a chance and see you in a better world!"
196,"This is the first movie in a very long time that i truly enjoyed. The adult in me loved the animation style, and the child in me fell in love with the characters. The movie had an overall holiday season feel to it, and touches your heart in a very beautiful way.Loved the music score in the movie as well, made me cry tears of joy"
197,"The cold and strange beginning is a warm and moving ending, which combines the exaggeration of old school animation and the delicacy of new school animation. After reading can not help but miss the past to send letters back and forth between the time."
198,"It's weird to me how many Christmas movies there are out there, and how few of them are any good. Fortunately, we now have a little gem with Klaus (2019). Animated in a beautiful 2D-esque style that uses 3D CGI as its base, Klaus works backward from what we understand as the current lore surrounding Santa Claus and develops a heartwarming story to explain all the little impossibilities that tie to the Yule tradition. And while it hits mostly predictable story beats, certain moments had me tearing up.What makes Klaus different from the rest of the Christmas-themed animated fare is that there seems to have been plenty of care devoted to the artistry of the visuals. It seems like most modern animated Christmas movies skimp on quality just to get something out to cash in on the holiday. The characters and character designs are unique and fitting to the story this movie is trying to tell. I don't want to throw around the term ""instant classic"" too much, but Klaus feels like the kind of movie I'd want to re-watch with my children as part of some annual Christmas tradition.In the end, the plot does an excellent job of displaying character growth across all characters. Granted, this is how all Christmas movies usually play out. However, the fact that the most significant changes in the worst town were all started by children goes to show how children aren't just our future; they're the fresh vision that looks at the status quo and can change it. I will admit there is a slight taint to the motives of most of the characters, as none of them are that altruistic. That being said, in cases like the one presented in Klaus, the ends can justify the means.A quality Christmas classic, I give Klaus 4.5 stars out of 5."
199,"Of course, there is no escaping a certain pattern, the Christmas stories are almost the same, but Klaus has a touch of originality, because unlike a classic like Mr. Scrooge, the story is not about avaricious people, but about divisions between people, unjustified hatreds, etc.It should be noted, at first, that our main character, Jesper, is a spoiled and immature, amid an environment of discipline and order. When he is sent to a distant place, he is placed in a reality quite different from his own, and here Sergio Pablos presents us with a very peculiar reality. A dark village, people hate each other, people attack each other, all in the name of an old ""tradition of hatred"", between two families.This film became interesting to me from the moment the challenge was launched to soften the hearts of these dark citizens. And there is nothing more fair than starting with the purity of children. From now on, the film develops into a beautiful story, which is not surprising, because it is predictable, but because it shows something real: purity, values, family."
200,"I was sceptical for a long time because of the drawings style, but was convinced in a short playtime that it is a good movie. I loved the little running gags that happen after the arrival of Jesper in his exile Smeerensburg, to which his father has sent him to become a serious grown-up at last. A little time further more characters were introduced and the story gained speed.I like the characters, the developement of the characters, the scenario, the complete storry. It didn't became misplaced cheasy over the whole runtime. I like this simple, but heartful story of friendship. It has it's sad moments, but it's always told in a way children can cope with and still make adults wipe away hidden tears. I recommend that to every christmas time between all the scrooge movies. It's emotional great, too. Love it!"
201,For years Disney did not much more than endless shreck clones. This animation brings true magic and is one of the best I've seen in years. Love it
202,"Klaus pretty much represents both sides of animated films in the 21st century. Sometimes you have a film with glorious animation and an immersive story that challenges the viewer. Other times, you have silly animation that feels like it's only meant for the kids of the household under 10 years old. It's a tale of two halves and Klaus at the very least, ends on a touching note and finishes well overall. The message is clear by the time the credits roll but for a while I was unsure about the direction the Oscar nominated feature was going.7.4/10"
203,"Here's a re-imagining of the holiday tradition of Santa Claus and how he came to deliver Christmas presents to good little boys and girls. I got a kick out of the 'lump of coal' treatment for those who didn't toe the line with their parents. I don't know how long that's been a troublesome mainstay, but it was well in place some sixty odd years ago when I was looking for gifts under the Christmas tree. The story starts out as a bit of a competition when a young layabout named Jesper Johannson (voiced by Jason Schwartzman) is assigned the task of achieving a goal of six thousand letters sent from the island outpost of Smeerensburg. Initially hitting the proverbial brick wall in a town of feuding families, Jesper is handed a lifeline when a burly widowed carpenter named Klaus (voiced by J.K. Simmons) decides to mail one of his many home made toys to an unfortunate young lad of the town. The idea snowballs, so to speak, and soon, all the kids in town are writing letters to Klaus to let him know how obedient and well mannered they were all year. With colorful animation in what I like to call a sort of wood-block style, ""Klaus"" is a fine, family friendly Christmas film that will join the ranks of other holiday movies as an annual event. In fact, after only three months since it's release in November, 2019 (as I write this), it rates a number five position in my list of IMDb viewer rated Christmas movies, joining 1966's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" (#3) and the prior year's ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (#4) in the Top Five. So a word of advice to future film makers, when it comes to Christmas. clever and original animated pictures seem to be the ticket."
204,"The amazing story makes this movie so special. The characters blend well in the story of this movie. These are the mvp of this movie. I think what Netflix needs is now to improve their animation like disney or pixar. This deserves the oscar for best animated feature more than how to train your dragon 3 and toy story 4. Frozen 2 didn't get the nomination for this category. Even if it did,it couldn't have topped this. However,this is better than the above mentioned movies because it is a good original movie. Other movies are sequels that have got great original predecessors. And sequels DON'T USUALLY GET OSCARS. except for toy story 3 and others"
205,"Klaus has all the best elements of Disney, Laika & even some Burton, all rolled into one. It's firmly planted within the tradition of animation (slapstick humor, bouncy score that matches visuals, broad but heartfelt themes) but pushes it into the future. It's so rare nowadays to watch a children's movie that's this original, where you can't immediately tell where it's going or how it's going to get there. A wonderful origin story that honors the importance of legends as much as the truth behind them."
206,"I had never cried when i watched a animation movie
But now i did, i can't even describe it!"
207,"I truly can't imagine anyone not being invested in and uplifted by watching Klaus. The plot has enough going on and the pace is swift enough to leave no lulls in the movie, and it is a film that everyone can enjoy (a daunting challenge). The heart of the story is easy for young kids to understand, but even the use of simpler tropes in the movie are referenced as clever meta humor so that no elements feel stale to adults. The development of Jesper and his goal is a perfect representation of one of the main messages: early on, it's a fun adventure to reach 6,000 letters, but you quickly see the effect he's having on the town and how his priorities shift. His realization that while his old life is materially appealing, it truly doesn't compare in satisfaction to his new life because what matters is really what he can do for others and the people he loves. Life doesn't need to fit an expected mold, but can be something freeing and unexpected. Klaus is a great character and a very fun origin for Santa, and Alva's transformation to loving teaching the kids was great. Their romance was great because while it was fitting, it wasn't played overly dramatically but presented as a natural occurrence, which was refreshing. The two moments where Jesper makes the plan to get the letters and then tells the mean kid about the naughty list followed by rap music playing were both hilarious. The animation is great, particularly in how the town transitions from gray to light over time. The climax and ending are great, with plenty of tension but a purely joyful finish. This is a wonderfully made family film full of heart."
208,The Santa Claus origin story isn't necessarily a new thing but Klaus seems to be one of the more inventive ways it's been done. The story takes place in the 19th century in what appears to be a country in Northern Europe (likely Norway). Jesper Johanssen (Jason Schwartzman) is the lazy and unambitious son of the Postmaster General who is stationed to the remote and unpleasant town of Smeerensburg as punishment for his poor work ethic as a mailman in training. Jesper arrives in a town long torn apart by a rivalry between two families and is simply looking for a way out until he chances upon Klaus (J.K. Simmons) the lonely and reclusive lumberman who likes outside the town. As Jesper needs to reach a quota of delivered letters before he is allowed to leave Smeerensburg he begins mailing letters from children to Klaus who begins delivering presents to the children of Smeerensburg. Soon the longstanding sectarianism between the two families begins to fade. I really enjoyed this story and found it a clever and inventive take on how Santa Claus came to be. The animation was very pretty and it just had an all around good feeling about it. Klaus comes highly recommended for children and adults.
209,"Wonderful movie with beautiful animation, great characters and genuinely heartwarming moments. Even the comedy was surprisingly good. The only reason I didn't give it ten stars is because I'm not a huge fan of the 'liar revealed' plot line. I find it a bit tiring and overused, and often pointless because we all know the characters are going to reconcile in the end. Regardless, I'll definitely be adding this to my Christmas favorites!"
210,"In the first half of the movie, you're wondering what this story has to do with Christmas, never mind Klaus (Isn't this supposed to be about Santa Claus?). But then you're happy you stuck with it, because it eventually turns into an incredibly beautiful, and possibly even believable story! A worthy addition to the list of Christmas movies we need to watch every December."
211,"Oneof those few gems in annimation that comes along every some years.... A must see, preferable during Christmas, but also any other time of the year enjoyable.
Sit back, relax, laugh, cry and go to bed happy."
212,"This really got me in the Christmas spirit, it's got vibes of The Emperors New Groove, which is one of my favourite animated movies. The Story is pretty predictable but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Great for adults and children."
213,"Klaus is a story full of magic. Excellent writing and animation. I gave it 9/10 becsuse i saw the Latin Version, and the dubbing actor for Jesper is a colombian musician without acting skills named Sebastian Yatra, i hate the producer took this kind of decisions just for marketing purposes."
214,"Exhibiting all hallmarks of a Christmas classic which it is destined to become in the years ahead, Klaus is a whimsical, wistful & wondrous delight that's crafted with passion, told with affection & is catapulted to new heights by its gorgeous animation to finish as this festive season's most wonderful surprise.Written & directed by Sergio Pablos in what's his directorial debut, Klaus marks the arrival of a new animation studio in the arena, and is a promising start to its filmmaking endeavours. Pablos goes old-school by employing traditional hand-drawn animation and the wizardry he conjures on the canvas provides his film a unique look.What's more commendable is that despite the groundbreaking animation, it's the story & characters that take precedence. The premise is heartwarming, characters are well-defined & it is cleverly witted. The frozen, faraway setting is perfect spot for origins of Christmas myth, and the way the cold palettes transition to warmer tones as plot progresses is mesmerising to watch.On an overall scale, Klaus is a beautifully evocative & emotionally resonant tale of goodwill & compassion that's sprinkled with healthy dose of heart & humour and comes enveloped with magical flair. A hilarious, heartfelt & joyous celebration of the good deeds that bring us together, Klaus is a blissful marriage of storytelling & animation mastery, and is arguably the best animated film of the year. Merrily recommended."
215,"Take the tale of Santa, add a unique animation and some dark humor. You got Klaus, it's funny, heart warming and will definitely become a holiday tradition to watch each year.Great cast, good film length, granted it maybe predictable at points but Netflix gave it their own spin on things."
216,"#Klaus is an absolute delight! Retelling the ""origin story"" of Santa is risky but it's executed so well. This could easily be an instant Christmas classic, and it's the perfect movie for kids to grow up with. The animation is a feast for the eyes. Netflix has a HIT on its hands."
217,"Klaus (2019) PG NetflixA big budget splurge from Netflix, though I'm sure they're hoping that it will be a festive favourite that viewers will return to, year after year, to justify their investment.Klaus tells the story of an heir called Jesper who is banished to a remote northern island to prove his worth by setting up a successful post office (it makes a bit more sense in the film). As he tries to meet the challenge so he can escape, along with a kind, old, bearded local woodcarver called Klaus, he accidentally establishes all the legends of Santa Claus. It does this quite well but, damn, it takes its sweet time to get there. It's halfway through before you sense how the film has anything to do with Christmas, and it's over an hour before the C word is mentioned.Despite being animated, I'm not really sure it will work for younger children. My daughter Libby sat in the room while we watched, but focused on her iPad the whole time. There's some lovely animation, but it needs to be funnier and the first half draaaags...Christmas Cheese Rating: 7/10 - Eventually, we get some Christmas imagery, but it mostly avoids the cheese.Snow Rating: 10/10 - It's set in the far north and relies on snow to remind you it's supposed to be a festive film.Actually Any Good Rating: 7/10 - It is good; once it gets going."
218,"Unusually dark for a Christmas film, which I appreciate. It took a little too long for
Jesper to do anything that made me feel a twinge of sympathy for him."
219,This movie is one of the best Christmas films ever. A complete joy to watch from start to finish.
220,The only reason I watched this movie is because of the stunning reviews.... and I don't get it. This is just an average film that isn't that funny or emotional. The animation looks pretty good though. Don't get bamboozled by the 10 star reviews
221,"Klaus has a really strong opening and premise. Sadly, everything starts to fall apart about half way through where it becomes painstakingly clear how everything will turn out. Down to the lazy romance, the obvious everything is great but then something will happen so it's not great (this part in particular made no sense, but I guess it just had to be there?) Followed by a happily ever after ending (which ofc makes perfect sense in a Christmas movie.)The characters are all very basic. Especially the antagonists have no depth what so ever. They are just bad because they're supposed to be.Don't get me wrong, Klaus is a great movie if you want some of that Christmas spirit, but it's far from being a masterpiece or even great."

223,"This was a pretty interesting origin story to how Christmas and Santa could've came to be. It's not great but it's a heartfelt and honest movie about kindness and redemption that you and your kids can learn a thing or two from. I loved all the music in this.Jesper was okay, he was annoying at times but had a good heart. Klaus was the best character out of the film, being the most developed and even provides a few touching moments. Margu, the 4 year old saami girl is adorable though I couldn't find subtitles for the saami language? But I still liked her relationship with Jesper and how kind her family were to him.There were a few things that bring the film down, though other than Jesper's occasionally mean behaviors, I didn't like the romantic parts of the film. They didn't have much development to them and seemed forced in there, no different from other kids' animated films. I didn't like the beginning when Jesper first comes into town and everybody treats him like trash for no reason. This part is supposed to go along with the cliche of a protagonist who is hated at first but then loved. That running gag of the old man in a rocking chair getting pranked got old really fast, thankfully it was only in there like twice but still annoyingly mean. And lastly, the part where people get together to try to stop Christmas from preserving, I thought that was pointless and wish there could've been more of a reasoning why these people, who are supposed to be the antagonists did not like their town's atmosphere changing. There were a few silly moments like how toward the end was Jesper able to successfully avoid going back to his hometown when we thought we saw him actually on the boat?So overall, a decent feel-good movie that you can put on for you and your kids to think about the true value of Christmas and to smile at the most wonderful time of the year."
224,"This is the kind of Christmas movie that I feel was so much needed. A sweet animated comedy that evokes emotions and entertains the audience from beginning to end.
The movie has great characters with which it's easy to empathize. The plot is nicely intertwined with the subplots (Alva and her school, the villains and their evil plot, Klaus' internal struggle). The character arcs are solid, the theme is communicated in an effective way and the story is very solid, particularly the second act, which is where most movies fall.
There's a small twist after the presents are lost where it turns out those were fake presents. I think it would've been more satisfying if that had been previously set-up in some way. I also feel there was a beat missing in Alva and Jesper's relationship, after he comes back, some sort of apology to her.
Still, these minor issues in no way shadow the super fun adventure this movie takes you in."
225,"Christopher Vogler, the famous Disney story guru, says every good story has a One-Word Theme. What about KLAUS? And how does its OWT connect to the meaning of the Title and Hero's Name--the other two corners of what I call The Symbolic Triangle?The secret of a story's thematic unity.I'll give you my three cents. But first . . .A friend of mine watched KLAUS four times--three times in one day! And she was so eager for me to see the movie too. So I texted her as I watched.And here they are, my texts as I thrilled to the wonder and wit, pratfalls and laughs, setups and payoffs, sights and sounds, and the welling up of emotions delivered by Sergio Pablos's fantabulous KLAUS.""i love this movie... what a beautiful story beautifully told... the transforming power of the Christmas spirit... the ""Klausmas spirit""... so clever... Santa Klaus origin story... and hits so close to homeklaus just told jesper about lydia... the big reveal (part 2)... klaus and lydia... build a house... build a future together... a future that never happened... total sadness... but hope and joy restored by the spirit of giving and a selfless heartand jesper's school teacher romantic interest now gonna show jesper why he can't leave, look what he's done to the town... and my own work (purpose), i have jesper-people to thank for helping me rebound like klausat the 45-minute mark, 1/2 way into the 90-minute story, when the reindeer and sleigh join for the first time and thrill jesper and klaus (and us) on their first sleigh ride... so great... and from that point forward, for those who do not know ahead of time where the story is going, we finally get a clue... a clue bigger than north-pole vicinity huge-bodied toy maker with white beard... and we confirm: the story that could be called JESPER is called KLAUS for a reasonwe knew it all along kind of but marvel at how the filmmakers' polaroid snapshot of their story developed slowly and magically and deftly before our very eyes to show us this sleigh ride of a story we find ourselves on... buckle upgreat stretch of about 17 minutes from the sleigh ride at 45 minutes to the end of the ""Invisible"" theme-song scenes... 17 minutes of major turning points and heartmovie magic""........................Well, those texts to my friend are about as honest as I can be about KLAUS. I've now watched the movie twice. I know why my friend watched it four times. And why we'll both watch it again and again.So much to see and appreciate. The story and screenplay. The animation, artwork, visual creativity and skill. The soundtrack. Amazing.KLAUS is a buddy movie: the selfless woodsman and the selfish postman. The sad toy maker and the spoiled brat. Two men in trouble. And only one knows it (Klaus). Two lost souls on the sleigh ride of life. One from a broken heart, the other from no heart.The Christmas spirit shakes them and wakes them, freeing the angel of their true name and nature: Jesper means ""treasurer."" ""Bringer of treasure."" Klaus is a form of Nicholas. Klaus means ""'the people's victory' and implies someone who serves his community and devotes himself to the greater good.""Together they bring the treasure of joy and goodwill to the unhappy ill-will soaked land of Smeerensburg, changing it from the Isle of Glum into the Island of Fun.Treasure Island.""A true selfless act always sparks another."" What Klaus told Jesper at that mid-point of the story, on their first sleigh-ride.""A true act of goodwill always sparks another."" What Jesper finally learned too.Both men learned to give. Give, not get (Jesper). Give, not keep (Klaus). Both men no longer would lead lives doomed to sorrow (Klaus) or self-interest (Jesper). Their lives bloom with meaning and purpose (why Jesper's concerned father sent him to Smeerensburg in the first place).In KLAUS, the selfless Christmas spirit that takes hold of Klaus and Jesper rekindles the hearts and reshapes the actions of an entire town. Naughty kids become nice. Then grownups too. Peace and goodwill rescue the townspeople from the curse of generations of the mirth & merriment of fight and spite.Klaus and Jesper's selfless spirit of serving the community for the greater good brings about a people's victory. The treasure of joy and giving. ""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men"" and women.And here's another meaning of the name Jesper: a name ""traditionally assigned to one of the wise men (also known as the Magi, or three kings) who were said to have visited the newborn Jesus.""Jesper the Magi.Jesper, a most unlikely hero--destined to become Jesper the selfless, Jesper the wise--came to Smeerensburg for a reason he didn't know: to visit Klaus. To cause Klaus to feel newborn. Jesper heralded the newborn spirit of Christmas for the joyless town of Smeerensburg by resurrecting Klaus from emotional death, unbearable grief. The dominoes of transformation then fall one by one, each good deed leading to another, transforming the people of Smeerensburg from the inside out.Klaus's prot√©g√©, Jesper--who, figuratively speaking, becomes the ""town treasurer""--undergoes a change of heart, a reversal of values--and therefore a reversal of fortune. He starts out as a lazy do-nothing rich kid who craves deluxe creature comforts. He ends up with a radically different viewpoint about what really makes somebody rich. Jesper learns, and helps others learn too, how true it is, as Jesus, the central figure of Christmas, said, ""For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.""KLAUS reminds us, What treasure could be more priceless than a golden heart? A heart full of love and generosity. A kindhearted and gentlehearted attitude toward other people, toward one's neighbors. A good heart, a heart that treasures selfless acts and giving.A heart like Klaus.""The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others,"" said Mahatma Gandhi. And that's sure what happened to Klaus. Never able to give the toys he made to the children that he dreamed of one day having with his wife, Lydia, who he lost, Klaus lost himself in the service of other people's children instead. And Jesper, the self-serving service worker? The postman who couldn't (or wouldn't) deliver the mail? The spirit of Klaus(mas) rubbed off on him too. Both men were lost. But the Christmas spirit, the spirit of giving, found them. And in turn, they experienced newfound meaning and purpose. Self-worth. And received love in return.Jesper even ended up receiving love from his well-meaning but strict father, who had Jesper's life all planned out. Jesper awakened in his father the treasure of goodwill, defined as ""a kindly feeling of approval and support.""All thanks to the selfless, redeeming, contagious spirit of Christmas. And the spirit of Lydia pulling the strings behind the scenes to give Klaus a clue. Who else swooped up through that swirl of snow, which happened three times in the movie, swooped up that first letter from the ground and gently carried it into the hands of Klaus? . . . forever changing his heart and therefore his destiny . . . and Jesper's too . . . and also the townspeople's of glorious battle-weary high-jinks Smeerensburg, stand-in for the North Pole.I love ERIN BROKOVICH, RUDY, and ALI--examples of movies where the title character is the main character. But some of my other favorite movies do what KLAUS does: set us up for a journey by the main character who isn't the title character. Movies like HER, MOTHER, COCO, and ANNIE HALL.Storytellers are Magi, bearers of gifts--to us. Magicians. And Magi/Magicians often put their cards on the table face down and wait for us to turn them over, knowing that treasures of insight will be ours if we dare to do so. I'll turn over one more card.KLAUS's screenplay helps me see that writers are Jespers: treasurers of imagination, illumination, and art, bringers of gifts to our soul, mind, and heart. Writers rescue us from self-absorption, confusion, and despair, rousing in us the saving grace of purpose and love. Writers deliver letters written in the ink of Klaus-spirited generosity, empathy, humor, insight, joy, and goodwill. These letters change the world.Just as letters do in KLAUS.___________________________________________The Symbolic Triangle of KLAUS:1. Title: KLAUS2. One-Word Theme: GIVE3. Hero's Name: JESPERI like other choices for the One-Word Theme too: Goodwill, Purpose, Selflessness, Christmas, Love, Service, Heart, Joy. And also . . .Help.Jesper's dad helped his son. Jesper, Santa's helper, helped Klaus. So did Lydia. Klaus helped Jesper. Each action sparked another. Two men and a town in trouble, all calling out for help without knowing it, got the help they needed. Kids helped their families. The teacher helped the kids. Everyone helped one another.Help and Give are two sides of the same coin. I like that both are verbs. Imperatives. I like that Help doubles as a noun and can be a plea, a prayer. I like that Give and Help both ask us to honor the call of the Christmas spirit, the call of the human hero-spirit, the benevolent universal spirit as old as time--and turn our goodwill into action.""A true act of goodwill always sparks another."" ""A true selfless act always sparks another.""Act.Act is a supporting OWT, too vague for the lead OWT. I really like Help (the buried thematic treasure in the story). But I lean toward Give. The iconic message of Christmas.KLAUS lifts our hearts and reminds us that the only practical way to spread Christmas cheer throughout the year is to summon our inner Jesper and Klaus: Treasure others and on their behalf, for the greater good, Act. Help people.Give.Like the hymn says, ""Give of your heart's rich overflow, And peace shall crown your joy-filled day.""KLAUS sure crowned mine.What a gift."
226,"'Klaus (2019)' is essentially a demystified 'Santa Claus' origin story and it's as formulaic as you'd, perhaps, expect. It's also just delightful. Its predictability can't prevent it from being good and, boy, is it good. It's an enjoyable, effective and visually striking animation with a kind heart and a gentle spirit. It sidesteps the sloppy sentimentality usually associated with 'Christmas' movies in favour of, essentially, a subtler sort of the same thing. Its 'Christmas spirit' is strong but well-earned, sweet but not sickly. The movie is just a joy, in general. It's fun, fast-paced and aesthetically distinct, brought to life with a beautiful 2D-3D blend. It doesn't feel entirely typical, either, thanks to its endearingly strange setting and relatively well-realised characters. It makes a couple of very minor missteps - such as a second-act lull in pace and a slightly odd ending - but it's ultimately a thoroughly entertaining experience. 7/10"
227,"Most of this year's Netflix releases have been bland and boring but I'm glad to say that Klaus is the exact opposite. I am confident in saying that this could become a Christmas classic although I had some issues that are common in Christmas related films. The story is a little simplistic. I know that it's more for children but I wish that these stories had a little more depth and more ideas presented. Even though the story is simplistic, it is still engaging. I was never bored throughout the course of the film and I was always interested in the characters and what they were doing. For a Christmas film, the characters are pretty good. The villains are kind of boring but the rest of the characters have their own interesting arc that they go through. This is boosted by some great voice acting from Jason Schwartzman, Rashida Jones, and J.K. Simmons who plays Klaus in the movie. Simmons gives the best performance in the film by far. Jason Schwartzman does a pretty good job although he was given a Christmas cliche that did annoy me. It's the standard cliche of a character has different motives that change before the end and has a misunderstanding with the other characters who ignore him. That happens in this film and it was a little obnoxious. Some of the music choices were pretty weird too. They decided to create an original song for the film and it didn't fit it that well in my opinion. The animation is beautiful in Klaus. It's all hand drawn animation and it reminded me of classic Disney films. The design of the town was pretty great and interesting with all these different characters doing different things. There were some jokes thrown into the film and some of them weren't that funny but the funniest ones were the jokes you can see in the background. All of these little visual cues were hilarious in my opinion. There is a lot of heart to this film. I was surprised at how much joy I felt when watching this and the ending was fantastic. It's sad and joyful at the same time. This is a film I will probably start watching every Christmas. It's a satisfying origin story to Santa Claus. Overall, Klaus may be a little too simplistic with weird music choices but its heart, animation, and voice acting make this an instant Christmas classic."
228,This is the first review I have ever written. My now favourite Ever Christmas film. I'm sobbing! What a classic.
229,Definitely one of the best christmas movies! Humorous and entertaining. Educational too! A good movie for all ages Can i just say margu is so cute.
230,"Wonderful movie with breathtaking animation.
I will watch it every Christmas from now on."
231,"It is not often I just enjoy a movie without looking at my phone anymore, but this animated movie had it all. I don't blame it for being predictable (because most movies like this are) and the small Sami girl was a cute plot addition that made me laugh out loud. Wonderful execution and a production with Disney/Pixar quality for sure."
232,My heart feels so happy and warm right know. Wow. By far the best christmas movie i've seen!
233,"Klaus is a Spanish animation Christmas film that showcases beautiful 2D animation against a traditional Christmas tale. It tells the story of Jesper a young postman who is sent far north to deliver mail and soon tries to bring the town back to life by helping a familiar Mr. Klaus deliver toys to children.It is a classic retelling of the Legend of Santa Claus Told with a unique voice and beautiful animation. The animation itself is completely unique by using traditional 2D animation and enhancing it with CGI to give it a whole new look. The characters are memorable, funny and relatable and help in bringing this new story to life.The voice acting is also great. Jason Schwartzman is perfect as the clumsy and often goofy Jesper and J. K. Simmons is perfect as the title character Klaus. What impressed me so much about this film on top of it's beautiful animation was it's heart. This is one of the most heart warming films I have seen this year that will put you in the perfect Christmas mood.The film manages to balance out comedy with whimsical moments that are poignant and uplifting by tell the story of Santa Klaus in a new exciting way that also feels familiar. It's wonderfully done and the final moments are tear jerkers in the best sense. It may be too soon to tell, but we may have a new Christmas classic on our hands that I could see families watching around the holidays for now on.Perhaps the only glaring flaws in the film reside in the films familiarity, stock villains and a few cliches sprinkled in. However, the film overrides this with terrific traditional animation, a wonderful whimsical tale and a whole lot of heart. Klaus is definitely worth your time."
234,"I enjoyed the storyline, and it's little wonders of how the artwork was created, gave me a nostalgia of Treasure Planet for some reason. I haven't seen a good Christmas movie for sometime, and this one took my heart away."
235,"This movie...not sure where to start...at first I was not sure if I would like it...I only started it because of the old school animation....but man o man....this movie is every bit awesome!
Its an amazing story of how an act of kindness sparks another...and how Klaus became a legend....
It's just so warm at all right places that it fills your soul up with happiness....
Please watch it....you'll not regret it...I promise :)"
236,"This, in my opinion, is Netflix's best animated movie so far, it has a simple yet poetic plot along side beautiful and well written characters."
237,"The movie was trending in netflix, so i thought i's give it a try. I am so glad i did! Love the entire story. Love the message. Its beauuuutiful!"
238,"Everything about this movie is perfect, the storyline is thoughtful and smart with just the right amount of humour. My kids and I all thoroughly enjoyed it. This will definitely be added to our watchlist at Christmas time."
239,"The visuals, Characters, Humor, story, and uniqueness are nothing but extraordinary!!! Usually with a story that has been told over and over again, things should get old and nothing should surprise you. But THIS..... THIS was the first ""Let's tell the Santa Story"" movie where I literally did not expect what was going to happen. I laughed out loud, and cried. After the movie was over I had to look up the writer/ Director because I want to see more!! A must see movie for sure!!!!!"
240,"Such a lovely feel good film with a nice Christmas feel to it.
IT'S adorable and really catches the love of Christmas for the kids."
241,"EXCELLENT, Amazing, Incredible. Extremely well made. We love it. Netflix surely did it."
242,Really nothing more to say than what i said in the title. I knew it would be a great movie from the first minutes
243,"This movie is, for so long as there is access to it, going to a be a new Christmas tradition for my family. We haven't ugly cried after an animated movie in year. Here's to hoping it'll be released on BluRay to own."
244,"This movie is very cute! It's honestly one of the most creative movies I've ever seen, it was just really fun!
2D animation is a lost art form!"
245,You should watch it it's a really heart touching movie.
246,A wonderful alternate Christmas story to explain how Santa Claus/ Kris Kringle came to be. Great animation (not your typical style) and a tremendous storyline. Funny and heart warming but not maudlin.
247,"I don't like Christmas, and I don't like Christmas movies. Most of them are just...obnoxious feel good movies that have terrible music.Klaus is the exception to the rule, albeit it with one annoying song. But I can live with that.The thing that really sells it for me is this: almost every single scene has a joke in it. Either a visual joke, a verbal one, etc etc. There's no stone left unturned when it comes to adding humor to Klaus. And it made me laugh out loud multiple times. The style fits the story perfectly, and it's pretty dark as well, without ever going over board.Story wise it's a classic; original with all the elements you need, except they aren't where you think they are.I can't recommend this movie enough; compelling character, great story, great animation. You only need to suffer through one horrible song, unless you watch the credits.So yeah, watch it!"
248,"This is honestly one of my favourite Christmas movies and will become a classic. Klaus follows a pampered, spoilt posh postman who is sent to this violent town, charged with delivering six thousand letters in year, although this proves to be a lot harder than first expected.The voice acting was immense. Jason Schwartzman had the spoilt brat in his voice, which became so lovable in equal measure. J.K. Simmons as Klaus never fails to deliver, and Rashida Jones imbued the right amount of sass but care for Alva. The character arc for Jesper was nailed and no character was sold short.The effects had the stunning mysticism of those amazing Japanese anime, whilst having the detail and over-the-topness of something like Ratatouille. Even the sounds were so detailed (scenes with birdhouses are so natural).It also took the Christmas spirit motif and made it fresh and original. I will leave out how they do this because it is better to it play out for yourself.It was predictable, and the foreign, eskimo type characters felt like they were put in at the last minute because they were forgotten, but frankly I don't care because it was so endearing and an amazing twist on a Xmas film."
249,"In many ways the best ""origin"" story ever! Animation to die for. Even the jokes work."
250,Wasn't expecting that. Beautiful movie. Best animation I've watched in a long time
251,"I always loved watching christmas movie, and I can tell you that for sure that no other christmas movie can top this one. This movie really reflects the real essence of christmas and very convincingly tells how the first letter was sent and how this tradition started. We dont even celebrate christmas in my country but I really envy the ""feeling"" of it and I can even feel it just by watching movies like this. So anyone that celebrates christmas, do this amazing holiday a justice, feel the love and watch this movie."
252,"Beautiful movie. Unlike many movies based on Santa, its not a movie that can be watched only during Christmas. The gradual progression of jesper's character makes him feel like a real person. The same goes for klaus's character. His backstory is revealed slowly as the film progresses. This movie is a must watch for people of all ages and will leave you thinking about it for long time"
253,"This film was made in 2019. It is now the end of 2020 and I only just heard about this. Why? Because it was released to Netflix and slipped me by. I've since spoken to several friends and none of them have heard of it either and yet - this is one of the most perfect Christmas films I have ever watched.The animation is fantastic, the storyline is brilliant, voice acting spot on. I seriously loved every minute of this film and it deserves to be seen by everyone and get its status as ""one of the best Christmas films"". And yes, I mean that."
254,"The movie hit on my emotions and I loved experiencing them all. Perhaps the scene that touched me the most was when Klaus followed the winter wind to meet his sweetheart. I've been married 35 years and I can't imagine my wife passing before me and having to wait to see her again. What a reunion that will be.
I loved the movie and can't wait for my children and grandchildren to see it. A Christmas tradition for sure."
255,"I'm a grown man, work in construction, shoot guns and eat meat. This movie reduced me to tears...It truly encapsulates the human side of the Christmas season and how important it is to be selfless and kind. Not only being entertaining but the movie provided a nice back story for all of our Christmas traditions like leaving milk and cookies for Santa or a lump of coal for bad kids and even subtle things like how the good kids brought the teacher a fresh apple.Granted the movie left out the religious side of Christmas and the story of the baby Jesus in the manger, it wasn't hampered by the omission. For some that may be a deal breaker but it also makes for a heartwarming yet family neutral movie.I truly could not recommend a better Christmas movie and can see this becoming an instant classic.Flat out well done."
256,"I am a harsh critic when it comes to movies. I watched this with my daughter first and fell in love with it. Later I convinced my husband, who is not a big fan of Christmas movies, to watch it with me, hoping he would enjoy it as much as I. He was transfixed and now claims it is his favorite Christmas movie. My husbands only lament is that we cannot purchase the film outright since it is a Netflix film. Wholesome, original, and coveys the magical qualities of the holiday season - this movie is a gem."
257,"What a great movie. It's original, it's funny, it's well made. Hats off to Sergio Pablos.It's so fun to see an animated movie with an original idea and a story that truly has something to say, especially when it's a christmas movie.
We don't get that many really good movies about christmas since they are mostly unoriginal and cheesy, but Klaus is a whole other story.I'm not gonna go into detail about the story since it's worth experiencing for yourself, but this movie is a great example on how to create a good animated movie that works for all ages. It's not childish and full of stupid jokes. It's heartwarming and beautiful.
We finally have a christmasmovie that's worth watching every year."
258,"I did not expect much of it, but was (more than) pleasantly surprised. My nephew (9) watched it 3 times and would watch it again and again and again..."
259,"What a wonderful delight. Every night I sit down with my 4 year old son and read a few books and watch a movie with him until Mom comes and takes him night night. Burnt out on Paw Patrol, Shaun the sheep etc... etc... I came to find the movie Klaus. I was instantly and pleasantly surprised by this movie. My wife came to get my son about 45 minutes into it and I paused the movie, said my good nights, and as he was being tucked in by Mom I continued watching the movie. This never happens! I usually just turn off T.V. but this animated movie had completely caught my attention. The storyline was amazing and there is no escaping the box of tissues or edge of your shirt in my case on the ending. In my opinion this movie will be a classic just like the old claymation Christmas movies."
260,"Nice to watch this cartoon. very kind, sincere cartoon for children and adults."
261,"This movie grabs me by the heart and doesn't let go. It's friendly, beautiful & heavy.
I've seen Klaus 3 times & everytime it gets me. I highly recommend you seeing it."
262,Totally blown away. What a fantastic movie. Loved it soooo much. I even cried at the end. Highly recommend
263,Such an underrated holiday animated movie that really tugs on the heart strings. You won't regret it.
264,"Brilliant graphics and great message, but no-one wants to listen to that millenial whoop yet again! (If you know what I mean, prepare remote for quick mute to spare best moments from being ruined. Otherwise, look up millenial whoop.)
Some cool soundtrack in there though, eg. 'don't want to mess with the postman' is hilarious."
265,"I have nothing to say because it was such the most beautiful movie I have ever seen!!! So meaningful! Love it! If you don't watch it, you will regret!"
266,"I really really liked it
The movie is so good talking about the animation itself the story... After the movie ended I felt this feeling of I don't know kind like wholesomeness and happy"
267,"We watched this last year when it released. We absolutely fell in love with it. I adore they went with hand drawn 2d animation. It's an original telling of Christmas and how Santa comes to be. It's comical, witty, charming and gives you all
Of the holiday feels. The ending gets me every time. If you want a new Christmas movie on your holiday roster please watch this one! You will not regret it. I encourage everyone to enjoy this instant classic because I know my family and I certainly do. üéÑüéÖüèªüíå"
268,Amazing feel good movie. Really recommend. It did make me cry but happy tears
269,This movie is a hidden gem. Cried at the end. Such a beautiful telling of a classic Christmas story in a unique way with such a great message for all. It is a movie all generations will enjoy
270,"This is a great story and new twist on Santa Claus, great characters, that you really enjoy. have to recommend it to everyone for their Christmas movie rotation.."
271,"Wow. Where to begin? Visuals, that's where. This movie is gorgeous. I love the way the light and shadow is done, and the animation is just perfect. As for character, what's not to love? There are deep characters, funny characters, and all-around good ones. Jesper is hysterical, Klaus himself is great, the-boatman-whose-name-escapes-me is funny...they're all good. The plot is great, the animation and characters are all good...I just cannot express how good it is. Watch it as soon as you can."
272,If your planning to watch it ...then do it!! you wont get disappointed i bet... better than Disney. i was worried that it will be a typical Christmas movie but its not its better than what i assumed.
273,"If kindness lives in everyone then all it takes is standing up, Can't touch it, see it
But you can always feel it. One of the best Animations ever & I enjoy of every single moment of it.nice story about Santa Klaus."
274,"Personally, not being a fan of the genre, I don't watch a lot of Christmas movies. But I must say that this is one hell of an emotional ride for animation movie lovers. Klaus is a movie more than what it speaks. It is one of those kinds of films that stay with the audience and makes us asking for more. There are many layers to the story which include addressing some political issues too. Rather than portraying certain ideas just for the sake of telling it Klaus shows the solution on how to make it happen. The animation is nostalgic, colorful, and fresh. Klaus brings up the fact that we don't need to do something big to make a change.
Watch it for a splendid animated movie experience."
275,This had me laughing out loud. It's a solid story to watch with the family.
276,"Man, from the gorgeous, whimsical animation, to the genuine humor, to the beautiful story, this movie actually manages to capture the essence of the Christmas season. It found the balance of grounded and meaningful with fantastical and silly, and I was blown away the entire way through. It's perfect for adults, but I also want this to be a classic for my kids, their canon Santa Clause story. I can't wait to share it with everybody."
277,"This really good movies, something we lost for so long. Touch our heart so deeply. This would be another new classic christmas movie."
278,Really loved the animation style of the movie. One of the best Christmas movies ever made.
279,If you are looking for a lovely feel good film for kids look no further !
280,"I have never watched such a warm, magical, smart and funny movie in my life!
The story is marvelous, characters are funny and genuine, jokes are super funny, exellently timed... and animation, oh animation is brilliant!
It brings a valuable message in such an endearing way! I stopped expecting such smart and genuine stories from modern movies.
This ine blew my mind!"
281,"When I decided to watch this movie, I never imagined it would give me such a wonderful feeling of love, affection and ending. I never thought I would laugh or cry while watching an animation.Now ""A true selfless"" is constantly repeated in my mind and I am looking for things to do to make children happier and the world a better place."
282,"Completely blown away. Definitely worth watching.The animation, the charecters are very good. The story is very compelling."
283,It's an adorable film that really brightens the Christmas spirit in ya.
284,"Simply beautiful. You are doing yourself a disservice if you don't watch this beauty of a film.
Please watch it 2d animation needs our support to not die out."
285,"I'm 18. I'm not christian nor live in a christian country. Still. I was crying for at least five mins while watching this movie. Perhaps it doesn't have cinematic significance and it probably has the cliche story telling most of us have seen before, but I believe both adults and children would appreciate this movie. I really recommend you watching it."
286,"It's a MUST watch! It's full of love, heartfelt, fun, and exciting! The animation is LOVELY as it brings life throughout this movie. Makes me smile hours after watching. I wanted to cry in certain parts with joy."
287,"It's one of the best movies I've seen. 10/10.A nice quote: ""A true selfless act always sparks another"".Very emotional movie.Excellent graphics.Well created atmosphere.Nice script."
288,"It's truly heart touching, emotional, meaningful, beautiful and the best!!!!
No words can express the beauty of the movie. Anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend you see this amazing movie and no excuses about it. Really loved that movie! I will miss the movie so much. There is so much to learn from the movie and one of the important lesson it teaches is that, ""A selfless act of kindness, sparks others"" and all the happiest things in the world is hidden in the small things which you will see in the movie."
289,"This movie is the best I've ever watched, like literally the best. The storyline was really amazing and the teacher is so hot!! (Kidding) (oops! Not kidding at all;) ). I think this is the only movie I've ever watched that actually described Santa Claus, all the other movies he's just a good guy who comes out once a year to give kids what they love most, but this movie it's a 365 days Christmas. Wow man, literally wow, mind-blowing. This should be the best Christmas movie ever for actually describing santa claus, and giving a meaning for his background. I never thought anybody actually cared about santa claus's background, I know this isn't the actual real story behind it but this one's pretty damn convincing I really love it so much. Thank you Netflix, for the best holiday movie. Keep the great work guys."
290,"2d cartoon does not bother me at all, what i enjoy about this movies is the rich of the plot and the newer perspective of cristmats. It can be enjoyed by both adult and kids, and it would not bored us for the second time of watching."
291,"All I can say is, this is one of the most amazing origin stories on how the legend of Santa Claus came to be. The human approach, the backdrop of nordic isle life and the importance of kindness is wonderfully encompassed in this tale. Full marks for the story telling with amazing voice acting of star studded cast."
292,"This movie is a rare one. It's not often you see a good, quality Christmas movie, and an animated one at that. The animation in this movie is phenomenal. The refreshing 2d style and shading gives a breath of life into the film. The story is good, a bit cliched, but still very good. Voice acting, and characters are excellent, especially Jesper who I feel had a very nice arc throughout the film. I would definitely recommend this movie, and will say that it should be recognized more! Don't let the 8 rating fool you! This movie is absolutely amazing!"
293,"I don't watch animated movies a lot but just happened to click on this and I just enjoyed it . Every scene makes me happy , amazing soundtrack , nice unique animation , a very new story something modern but quite nice . Must Watch !"
294,"I have watched this film twice, once during the Christmas season and once recently. I can safely say that this film was an extremely enjoyable experience both times. The animation is smooth and aesthetically pleasing. The story is heartfelt and is a welcome interpretation on the Santa Claus story. The characters work well. It's a little formulaic but, overall it's a really great family film and one of my favourite Christmas movies."
295,"Klaus (2019) :
Brief Review -Goodwill triumphs in this Emotional Roller-Coaster fighting against ancient Hatred. 'A true selfless act always sparks another'. Klaus is a sweet and entertaining tale about how goodwill and selfless act can beat out traditional hatred. But additionally it is about Human Emotions, friendship, love and choosing a right path. I liked three things about this film, first is when Hero declines his lonely lavish lifestyle for the sake of love and happiness he's receiving in a small village, second is Emotional Friendship of Klaus and Jesper and third one is the most important when true act of Kindness brings joy in horrible village and people start loving each other forgetting all the hatred they have for each other. Goodwill always triumphs no matter how worse conditions are, how difficult the path is and that's something i can never Dislike in any film. That's a full prrof formula you know and mostly many Animatied classic have used it perfectly. Klaus too does it perfectly with more realistically emotional stuff rather than using fantasy. The production design is terrific, the whole snow world, costumes, houses, school etc everything is good looking. Klaus has a pacy screenplay and the easy & innocent humour keeps it for entire 96 minutes. Most of the people liked the idea of Christmas used in the climax portion and even though i could not connect to it because of me being from different culture, i still connected to the joyful expressions of those kids and of those who made them happy. What film lacks is little high emotional stroke in the ending scene and glorification of a Postman. I didn't cry at the ending but i did cry in pre climax scene because more than friendship emotions i fell for human emotions. Overall, A Brilliant Emotional and Balmy Animated flick for all Ages.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"
296,"Beautifully written , not ordinary story with such a perfect animations ... It touches in the center of a human souls , cant remeber when i last cried like in Green Mile ."
297,"Very solid story, the illustrations/art of this movie is simply breathtaking, it's all so funny, cute, and inspiring.
One of the best animations done recently, I can't recommend it enough"
298,"Such a Heart warming...
The plot, story... kinda feel nostalgic..
Our granny used to tell, all the stories about Santa Klaus. Soft & heart warming movie"
299,"A simple story about the origin of Santa Claus, with a strong fairy tale color and even a predictable ending, really touched the audience.Although the script is very familiar, is a new bottle of old wine, but the wine is really sweet, the script before and after full of the Christmas spirit of excavation and sublimation, watching the process of several tears, very good, not to mention the craftsmanship spirit"
300,"The plot is not complicated, but I dare to edit it. Everyone knows how to come for Christmas. How does Santa's tradition of giving gifts to children on this day come? This movie is composed of such a story, the key is that the story is compiled as it is, with all its heads and ends, and complete. Santa is a single old man who has lost his wife and no children and loves to make toys. When he was alive, he sent toys to the children in the town with the postman. After he died, he became a Santa Claus and gave the toys to children all over the world. The origin of Santa Claus turned out to be such a sad and touching movie."
301,"At first glance this is a very common story. We have a rich and spoiled guy who don't want to work, so his father sends him far away to teach what is ""true life"".
But then we've got a wonderful story about life of Santa Klaus. The movie story totally fits the original myths about Santa but without magic.
In general this is nice movie to watch with family or if you need good mood"
302,"Loved the characters and the relatability of it. Moved well, the movie, despite its cliches and definitely a good watch."
303,"This film is delightfully deceptive. It starts out with a simple story of a postman who has been sent on a fool's errand but he gets to know the remote community he is sent through and brings them all together, leading to the first Santa delivery. Very charming."
304,Very enjoyable movie in a nice setting and warm hearted relationships
305,"This movie made me understand why I like Christmas for foreign talents. Christmas seems to me: family, childhood, relatives, friends, watching movies in high school. These bits and pieces of beautiful memories constitute Christmas. (Including the Spring Festival), we will go home in December! The best re-entry of the year I AM COMING HOME !!!!!!"
306,"In fact, this film has a lot of information
There are many places to explore
For example, two families who hate purely for hatred
Patriarch who maintains his position through hatred
The little girl with no language (Finnish is said to be few in China)
What is the original purpose and expectation of the protagonist's family to hone the protagonist?
What is the previous relationship between the protagonist's family and ClausHow do children affect the relationship between parents and adultsThe relationship between the purpose of Christmas and business conductand many moreIn generalThe style and color of this film are quite uniqueMore unique is the interpretation of SantaRich storyline and smooth rhythmAlso quite thoughtful"
307,The artistry and message of the movie was beautiful and the background was very detailed.
308,"This film is absolutely amazing. It may be predictable, but it has more heart than most of the movies I've seen. This is a new Christmas classic."
309,"Everything was handled beautifully, the character development, the cinematography, everything. This is truly one of the greatest animated movies out there!"
310,"It took me some time to watch this, but I have nothing more to say, it is impecable! the animation, the music, the voices.... everything is just so well done! it became a absolute favorite of mine!"
311,"The style of the animation was very entertaining, the subtle jokes, expressions on faces. very enjoyable to watch."
312,"If I were Disney/Pixar I would bow in awe to the masterpiece that this animation is. It's blessed with a great script, great animation and cinematography, great characters and a lot of chemistry between the voice actors. I loved every minute of it. It is absolutely marvellous.Get your family together next Christmas and WATCH THIS!"
313,I love every bit of it & the plot is very new about the everybody's favourite Santa 'Klaus'.
314,"Lovely animated film that creates a hypotetical and plausible origin for Santa Klaus myth through a selfish scheme planned by a rich silver-spoon youn man in a far away cold little town marked by a long-time family feud. Both the man and the town change eacg other, and so do other characters, like a certain Klaus from whom the movie takes the name..."
315,"To be honest..I just didn't expect this film to be such a pleasure to watch. It was like ""Netflix movie?? Ok lets try this"" and as usual Netflix didn't disappoint .
The animation is very much different from what we are used to watching. But it will give just a mind-blowing experience.
This story is more leaned towards a postman rather than the ""Klaus"" it self..
The story just tries to show us may be this is how all the concepts of Christmas and Santa Claus came..such as why he uses u raindeers..why use imagine him flying...and most importantly why he gives PRESENTS.
The music..the climax..the animation..the dubbing is extremely perfect
But..I think the ending could have been much more better and satisfying..
But still I would say that watching this Netflix movie is a mind-blowing experience"
316,"It is such a heartfelt movie. Amazing 10 out of 10. Wonderful story, characters, character development, emotion and humor all jammed packed into this sensational movie that was awe-inspiring. A definite must watch."
317,"Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) is a spoiled young man who fails at his job which was given by his Postmaster General father. As a disappointment to his father, the father sends him to the kingdom's far north island and offers him a deal to come back to the comforts of home after 6000 letters. The locals have ongoing feuds and generally express themselves in person rather than in letters. With a desperate need for any letters at all, he goes to the far end of the island where he finds an old reclusive toymaker named Klaus.Animator Sergio Pablos tries his hand in filmmaking and hits the first pitch out of the park. It's a solid origin story for Santa. It's not necessarily an original idea but this original version is executed very well. It has a great theme that fits perfectly with Christmas. It is emotionally satisfying and it has the potential to becoming a Christmas classic."
318,"It is probably one of the best animation movies I've ever seen. Why? Because it is a full package of emotions. I also appreciate the imagination and the humor in this movie. I guess, this year, the 'ANIMATED FEATURE FILM' category did not receive the needed attention from the Academy Award."
319,"""Klaus"" is a beautifully animated and well-written Christmas film that is inventive, imaginative, and well-intentioned."
320,"If it is made by Disney, it could have won the oscar.
Just watch this!!! It's a movie about humanity.When Jesper says,""Once in a year, I get to see my friend"", I nearly cried."
321,"An emotional, gentle movie that gives us all an important reminder to do good without expecting reward."
322,"This debut movie by Sergio Pablos is supposedly the origin of Christmas, which in itself works as the basic premise for a fun holiday adventure - but in a twist, it rather becomes the story of a spoiled young postman joining up with an antisocial lumberjack to create a myth that children make out to something great.This movie is currently on IMDb's Top 250 list, and truly deserving of it. Rather than just being the story of how kindness overcomes all (which is still a big part of the movie), it reinvents the message in a clever fashion and provides us with a colourful set of characters, all with their complex personal issues, and becomes far more than some children oriented tale that you may expect.The animation, which must also be mentioned, is fantastic and acts as a stylistic blend of 3D and 2D styles - it will be interesting to see what others can make of this in the future.In conclusion, it is an incredibly funny, but also deep and heartwarming movie that should not be missed - totally deserving of its Oscar nomination and high IMDb rating."
323,"Klaus is about a guy who has to get to 3000 letters in a place were no one really uses the postal service. He comes up with new ways to get letters like maybe getting a man named Klaus involved!Klaus was a fun movie. I don't really know why it was nominated for an Oscar. I guess there was no better animated movie to put in its place. It was fun a fun film but shouldn't have been on the best animated film list. I thought the animation was pretty good. It was different than most films made now. It was just going for sort of a looney toons animation. It was cool to see something different. There were some pretty funny scenes that everybody not matter what age would chuckle at. That was something it did well. The story was a different take on how Santa Claus came into being. It was fun to watch that. It was something different than your typical story. The only problem with the story was the start though. It was too confusing for anybody to understand. I didn't really know what was happening until we got a little farther. That was a little annoying. It was also way too predictable. You would see what was coming from a mile away. You knew how it was going to end. That was a little annoying.Overall, Klaus was a fun film for the family to watch on Christmas."
324,Movie was awesome. One of Netflix's pg animation movie
325,"Why Klaus Is Amazing
Even before one word of dialogue has been said you can already tell that you are in for a treat, the animation and artwork for this movie is absolutely gorgeous and it helps the visual storytelling by a lot. Before knowing what's going on the art shows us we are in a timeless land and that this is a remodeling of the old Christmas story of Santa. The actual plot is amazing, it takes many cliches but makes it work in a way where they actually work as good storytelling devices. Every single detail and point made in the story equal to amazing results and quality. The new take on Mr. Klaus was wonderfully done and with the addition of the art design it helped all the audience to feel like a kid again, everything that was once magical IS magical still. I dont believe I have ever seen a movie that told the story of Christmas in a new way and actually worked as an amazing piece of art. The length that this story goes with its new Santa is done magnificently, making him a regular human (or so we thought) not only made us connect with him more but also made us smile like kids to know that this man is Santa. The main character of the story Jesper Johanna is a regular post office man who helps create the Santa story, making him come up with the naughty list and the giving children toys on Christmas thing was such a wonderful surprise. Because we love this character we don't mind him changing the story, although it did bother me at first that Santa wasn't just a magical being, the ending made me really wonder ""was he really not magical? Or did I just not notice"" the way they humanize him is truly incredible. The wind as a symbolic reference to Santa's past lover is a cliche but works so well in the story that it doesn't take anything away and just adds even more. The wind being symbolic for Santa's wife and the wind moving through the snow, (which is connected to Santa because it represents Christmas which he holds dear to his heart) just creates even more amazing symbolism. The ending was amazing and really was an unexpected tear-jerker.Dislikes
I think we could've seen more of the life Jesper had before he moved to the city but it definitely didn't hinder the movie at all and I didn't like the songs they played in the middle when they were all sad, but it was still great for giving an experience.
My Rating/ Recommendation
I would 100% give this movie an 87-90% it is truly a sight to behold. This movie is a fantastic tale of love, loss, redemption, and peace it truly is a symbolic reference to our society today and is worthy of many awards in my books not only for the amazing art style but for the creative direction this movie took. For being only 1 hour and 30 minutes I was satisfied until the sweet but bitter end. Go watch this movie now!"
326,"I was surprised, to say the least. It is smart, funny, and overall amazing work.The song in the middle, however, was quite obnoxious and out of place. Weird choice."
327,"As another reviewer stated this was a nice surprise! I did not expect it to be as good as it was. I thought it'd be just another animated movie, light fun and all. But it really has quite some heart to it. And it's an origin story as well. Many little things that work quite well. Be it the opposing groups, that have more in common that one may think. Or the adults versus kids/younger ones theme that runs through the whole thing.The animation may be a point of criticism for some, but overall that is nice too. Not to mention the voice talent recruited. While you may know where this will eventually be heading, the beginning at least may surprise you. In a positive way - as is the rest of the movie"
328,"""Klaus"" is another take on the legend of Santa Claus but it hasn't a ""I've already seen it"" type of taste. The movie is technically excellent with a great direction, a magnificent photography and a beautiful music. But the best things are the concept design (that is so important for an animated movie) and the animation itself. Indeed almost every fun moment of the movie is of physical comedy but it works so well thanks to the animator that did a great job. The film is very funny and colourful but it has some touching moments too and it has a beautiful message for the kids but most importantly for the adults, in particular for those who grew up with some form of anger or resentment. And for these reasons ""Klaus"" is a very very good animated feature, I think it will become one of my Christmas classics!"
329,"The film is very good, The animation style is really impressive, The story is both original and interesting and the film works for both children and adults. My only complain was that the film is really slow in the first 30 minutes and it may lose some of the more impatient viewers interest."
330,"The film is very good, The animation style is really impressive, The story is both original and interesting and the film works for both children and adults. My only complain was that the film is really slow in the first 30 minutes and it may lose some of the more impatient viewers interest."
331,"Animated movies are the best. Change my mind!!! Last time I felt happy like this after watching a movie was big hero 6. This movie is just perfect.
The theme of the movie is ' A simple act of kindness always sparks another '. I feel really blessed after watching this movie and today is my birthday too.
Trust me and watch this movie please. It's kinda like rise of the guardians but much better."
332,"I hope your family enjoys this movie as much as mine did. I started watching this with little anticipation. The kids asked to watch it. I said, ""Sounds like a Santa movie."" My 13 y.o. says ""No, Dad, it's not."" But, we both found out it was. But, not your typical one. This is a great family movie!"
333,"The animation in this is absolutely incredible in this movie. It's such a good and wholesome movie that tells you how Santa (Klaus) became this character we all know and love by showing you all the things we know about Santa making you see why people see him as this character. The movie keeps on knodding you that Klaus is Santa, showing things like ""How the naughty list was made"" in the most creative ways. When in reality he's just a normal guy with a good heart. Absolutely recommend this"
334,"I'm just going ahead and saying it, Klaus is a fantastic animated joyride. I love its take on the origin story of Santa Claus as Jesper and Klaus himself are the reason the film elevates so well. In fact, all of Jasper's interactions were well developed and quite charming to witness as they helped him understand the main moral of the plot: the best things in life comes from the simplest things with friends and family. Much like Kuzco, Jesper turned from an arrogant, egotistical individual, to a lovable and kind-hearted person who is willing to devote his time to make children happy in an otherwise miserable place. Some other characters like Alva was also quite the interesting individual. Add the impeccable performances, like Oscar-winning J.K. Simmons and stunning, breathtaking animation, this is one gem I highly suggest watching with an o so satisfying conclusion."
335,"I usually feel weird when I see or hear anything Christmassy before or after late November or December, but with this English-language Spanish Netflix made cartoon movie getting attention during Awards Season, I was prepared to make an exception and it watched it in early February. Basically, set in the 19th century, Jesper Johansson (Jason Schwartzman) is the lazy and spoiled son of a wealthy Postmaster General. He is enrolled into the postman training academy; his father hopes to reform him. But Jesper deliberately underperforms, forcing his father to give him an ultimatum. He is tasked with delivering six-thousand letters within a year, on the distant island town of Smeerensburg. If Jesper fails, he will be cut off from the family estate. On his arrival, he meets sarcastic ferryman Mogens (Norm Macdonald) and bitter teacher-turned-fishmonger Alva (Rashida Jones). Jespers finds out that most of the town's populace is made up of the Ellingboes and the Krums, two warring families, along with many other miserable people who hardly exchange words, let alone letters. For some time, he tries desperately to find a way to post letters but finds no mail to be collected from any of the houses on the island. But then on the map in his office Jesper notices that there is an isolated dwelling at the far end of the island. He travels there and discovers a reclusive woodsman named Klaus (J.K. Simmons) with a house filled with handmade toys. Jesper is terrified by the large man with a big white beard and flees, inadvertently leaving behind a sad drawing he took earlier made by one of Smeerensburg's children. Klaus forces Jesper to lead him to the boy's house depicted in the drawing, and then makes Jesper secretly deliver a toy to the boy inside. Word of this event spreads to other children, each believe that they will receive a toy if they send a letter, so they visit Jesper the next day. He capitalises on the idea and goes to Klaus to propose he donates his variety of toys; Klaus agrees on the condition that they operate at night, and that Jesper continues to deliver the toys in secret. Soon, more and more children begin writing letters to Klaus. Jesper decides not to give a child known for misbehaviour and bullying no toy, instead leaving a lump of coal. He tells the children that Klaus only gives toys to good children, he says that Klaus always knows when any child misbehaves, and he has a ""naughty list"". The acts of kindness that follow inspire the rest of the townsfolk to end their ancient disputes, and Alva reopens her school to help the children learn to read and write. Eventually, Jesper and Klaus begin running out of toys to give to the children. With the end of the year and Jesper's deadline coming up, he tries persuading Klaus into making more toys in time for Christmas. There is a misunderstanding between Klaus and Jesper, after which they reconcile, and they work together to make a sled for a small S√°mi girl named M√°rgu (Neda Margrethe Labba), who lives in an isolated settlement with her people. Klaus finally opens up to Jesper, he tells him about his wife Lydia, explaining he made the toys to give to children the couple hoped to have but never did, and Lydia eventually died from illness. Klaus has realised their work has been spreading joy to the children and agrees to the Christmas plan. As the town and his relationship with Alva flourishes, Jesper finds himself wanting to stay in Smeerensburg. Family elders Aksel Ellingboe (Will Sasso) and Tammy Krum (Joan Cusack) want to resume the traditional feuding, they form a temporary truce in order to stop Jesper and Klaus. They trick Jesper's father into coming to the island, made to believe Jesper has posted fourteen-thousand letters, he arrives on Christmas eve to congratulate his son, inadvertently revealing to Jesper's friends the selfish reasons for his deeds. Just as they are about to leave town, Jesper's father notices his son's remorse, and after a talk he allows Jesper to stay in Smeerensburg. The elders and their gang chases after Klaus travelling with a sleigh filled with wrapped Christmas gifts. Jesper tries to stop them and apparently fails. The elders leave believing they have destroyed the toys and restored traditions to the town, however Alva had been informed of the plot by the town's children, so she and Klaus had already replaced the toys with decoys. Jesper is redeemed, and Smeerensburg becomes a happy town, with the family elders being forced to end the family feuding due to the marriage of their children, Mr. Ellingboe's daughter and Mrs. Krum's son. Jesper marries Alva and raises two children, and he and Klaus continue to deliver presents in Smeerensburg and beyond for eleven years. On the twelfth year, Klaus follows a gust of a wind calling him and disappears, seemingly to join his departed wife. Every Christmas Eve from then on, Jesper sits beside the fireplace and sees the spirit of Klaus continues to deliver toys to children around the world. Also starring Sergio Pablos (the director, writer and producer) as Pumpkin / Olaf and The A-Team's Dwight Schultz as Additional Adults Voices. This is a terrific alternative story of the origins of Santa Claus, with a postman deep in the Arctic Circle that, with the help of a toymaker brings joy to a cheerless community, and everything you may expect is covered, from reindeer pulling a sleigh, to children being naughty and nice. It also has a great cast of actors as the voices, and the animation is of course impeccable, it is a little darker than traditional Christmas movies, but that actually makes it more interesting, and it does warm the heart at the right moments, it is a worthwhile seasonal animated comedy-drama. It won the BAFTA for Best Animated Featured Film, and it was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!"
336,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. Klaus was very emotional and it stands for the values I respect the most which are : respect, peace and hard work. I found this work of art to be absolutely touching, not only is this story original, but we also witness several endearing characters evolve and grow up from the denial they were blinded by (even the villains' character ark seem to be the most interesting ones to my eye.) The final line was phenomenal too.Klaus is without a doubt, among the best Christmas movies ever made. It's already a classic, and I love to see it.
(n-b : I'm a huge Toy Story fan, but in my honest opinion, I feel like Klaus should've won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature for every thing this movie embodies and especially for its sincerity and emotional value) 9/10"
337,"It had it all: humor, sensitivity, action, plots, but above all a great could be explanation on where all the 'facts' originated from üòÄ. Seem it 3 times already. For all ages, including a 2 year old."
338,"This movie is all about the amazing story. The story and the characters are the mvp here. It has got some good humor. The variety of several emotions was present. I got to say it surely deserves the oscar for best animated movie more than how to train your dragon 3 and toy story 4. Frozen 2 may not be nominated for the animation film category. But even if it had been submitted, it could not have topped this for the depth it carries. It is one of the best animated movie of 2019."
339,"This would have been a perfect movie, had it not followed the extremely over used plot structure. I think people are tired of seeing comedy, adventure, action, sadness, action, loss, comeback, more action, and conclusion. It's like a very over used song structure, for some of us works to make a movie popular, but to others it loses some originality. Other than this critique, the movie is fantastic in every wah"
340,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Klaus"" (2019) is the type of an animated movie that will be adored by grown ups maybe even more then children. This is because of the non traditional animation and story being more serious and deeper then kids movie. As for the movie itself - i was kinda blown away by it for first 35 min - it was very original. Later it did settle in very familiar plot, yet was still very good.Overall, ""Klaus"" (2019) is not a typical animated movie about Santa and Christmas. It a original looking, and most not predictable movie. And a really good one."
341,"The film mixes the imaginary of Santa with adventure and love (the spirit of Christmas) in a fantastic way. The animation is beautiful and there are nice poetic touches about building a community in every part of the film.
Definitely will be included in the holidays watching list for the next years."
342,"The town was built on resentment and spite.""
When the new postman arrives in town, he gets mocked because no one uses the mail and so having a postman in town would be useless.
Will the two clans reunite and finally break the ""tradition""?A movie that delves into the myth of Santa Claus with such an original and endearing storytelling that will warm your hearts and bring tears of happinessThe plot is predictable but you will appreciate the originality in how it explains the reasoning behind Santa tropes like the toys, the coals, the reindeer, and the chimney. The film managed to get me to tear up because i genuinely loved the friendship between Klaus and Jesper. It is an enjoyable ride seeing them change the townThe ending I seriously didn't see it coming. It surprised me. It was the perfect ending no one could see coming.This movie is definitely one of the best-animated movies I've watched, If you haven't seen this movie I would highly recommend it."
343,"So here I am, watching Klaus, a Christmas film, on Netflix, in mid-January. Pretty normal for someone like me, but for most, it's likely a criminal offence.The animation is breathtaking. Enough said.No, but in all seriousness, this is a modern Christmas classic. Yes, there are some weird song choices used that stick out like a sore thumb. Yes, the third act doesn't land too much. And yes, this is a Netflix film, which may annoy some. But this truly warms my heart, even when my heart is at it's coldest.The film's incredible hand-drawn/2D animation is a breath of fresh air for an industry overshadowed by 3D animation, with occasional stop-motion attempts here and there. Not only this, the animation allows the characters to have phenomenal designs as well. When looking at the cast, the only real standout is JK Simmons, but in the film, everyone is giving it their all. From the aforementioned Simmons to Jason Schwartzman as Jesper, hell even the smaller roles have actors/actresses doing a great job. And the characters are so fun to watch. Jesper and Klaus make for a unique and brilliant dynamic, and their chemistry is never-ending. The story itself is interesting enough to keep me engaged, so that gets a solid pass.It's hard to believe that the director of this, Sergio Pablos, was one of the co-creators of the Despicable Me franchise of films/merchandise. But that shouldn't be an issue in the slightest. You may find yourself drawn in due to the phenomenal animation, and yes that is true, but stay for the ride and you'll find more than just the animation to keep you entertaining for nearly 100 minutes.Oh and I did I mention the animation is brilliant?"
344,There is nothing spectacular or unique in its story and perhaps thats precisely its simplicity that makes it so good and so emotional. It's funny and I think this may well be a new Christmas classic to watch every year that will pass on to future generations.
345,"Wasn't intrested much, decided to watch anyway without much expectations,Damn! it so beautiful both the animation and the story.We need more films like this for kids."
346,"It's refreshing that we can still get new Christmas classics. Because I think this film has a fairly hefty chance of ending up as one. Animated by Sergio Pablos and his animation studio, and distributed by Netflix, Klaus is the story of Jesper, a privileged, pampered heir to an enormous postal empire, who ends up being sent to a remote island to run its deserted post office. There he ends up inadvertently starting the myth of Santa.The film is, first of all, absolutely gorgeous. Hand-drawn animation is such a dying art form these days, that it's always a feast for the eyes to see one, but even despite that this would be an eye-popper. Especially how seamlessly the characters blend with the backgrounds, or how soft the lighting can be. Pablos used to work for Disney during their Renaissance and took it up as his goal to take the art form even further. I'd say he one hundred percent succeeded.As for the story, it's nice. Jesper is a bit of a clich√© character. A pampered prince forced to work for the first time in his life in a remote village where his heart will finally melt. You've heard this a million times. That being said, the location of Smeerensburg is different enough that it feels kind of new. I also really like the character of Klaus, who's this hulking beast of a lumberjack, who nevertheless speaks rather softly and spends his time making toys. While carrying around an axe big enough to make a Tolkien dwarf proud. Now this is a Santa I can get behind.I like this. It has enough new things to give it a distinct identity, has a nice message, good characters and a gorgeous animation style. What's not to like? I'm definitely checking this out again come next Yuletide."
347,"It was wholesome, funny and heartwarming.
Though the massive overreaction of the characters made no sense when they found out Jespers intentions. Ruined the movie a bit after that point."
348,"Nowadays I do believe that everything is psychology. Behind everyone's actions, there is a reason, a need he tries to feed, but I deeply believe most of us are unconscious. We do things, but we don't really know the reason! We don't really question ourselves and our inner thoughts and feelings.And probably, by now you may think all the above have absolutely nothing to do with this film and they are irrelevant, but let me disagree. Let me, also, explain to you.On one hand this beautiful story, comes to break the magic about Santa Clause; as a child that believed in his existence until.. well 13?15? (Can't remember) in the beginning I really did not appreciate destroying this bits of happiness and magic he brings with his existence.However this film comes and creates sense in all these things you've been sure all these years that were just part of a beautiful fairytale for kids. It brings logic and reality in each little thing, explaining everything you know about him...And by the moment you're so sure that's all, by the moment you think it's the end, then happens the unexpected and it gives you back the magic, the faith, the hope.So in the end they made Claus even more real, no matter if you want to believe in him or not!
PS. The movie, technically could have some slight changes which would make it even more complete and not predictable on some points, but overall, it deserves for suuure your time and attention!!"
349,"It's been a long time sense i enjoyed an animated film like this one, maybe sense Coco."
350,"This has to be one of the best holiday movies out there and certainly one of the best animated films to come out this year.With beautiful artwork, brilliant storyline and lovely storytelling, this movie is a great embodiment of Christmas feeling. I loved the music, haunting when it needs to be, lilting when it has to be. The characters were delightful.Pure Christmas magic!"
351,"Klaus is a great christmas animation movies and one of my favourite ones.
I put it on one level with Nightmare Before Christmas which is a great compliment in my opinion. I recommend this movie."
352,"Quick paced, unique plot, great animations. Maybe could have developed Klaus' wife's character more however it was a very funny heart-warming film."
353,"A beautifully crafted story. The fairy tale story telling which a 2D film inherits, magnifies the story line. You can dig yourself in, until the story ends without knowing the time passed by.Best Christmas cartoon in my opinion!"
354,"This was so good. The animation is great, the voice-acting fits the roles, and the writing is fun. The humor is excellent, and the story is a good ride. This easily just placed into my top-5 Christmas shows list for watching each Christmas season."
355,"NO SPOILERS""Klaus"" is, in my opinion, one of the best Christmas films ever made. It is so wonderfully animated with characters you care about, a great score and voice performances all around, especially by Jason Schwartzman and J. K. Simmons. The story is great but at times a little cliched. I would say the film is a little predictable, but the execution is great. Also, I found the soundtrack choices a bit weird. It just felt off with a pop song in the middle of an emotional scene. But those are minor nit-picks. Overall a great Christmas film for all ages (over the age of 7)."
356,"Would love to see more Christmas movies like this one. It got all the ingredients, story is great and it looks beautiful!"
357,"I rated the movie a 9/10, if I was rating purely based on the quality of the movie it might be slightly closer to 8/10, but I gave it that little extra cause in the Christmas movie genre which has more than it's fair share of stinkers, this movie stands very close to the top.For me this is one of the 3 best Christmas movies I've ever seen, if you want a Christmas movie you can't go wrong here.FYI- If you are a parent watching this with your kids, I'll just give a small caution it's mildly different take on Santa Claus than what Christmas canon dictates, it might require the smallest of little white lies to bring it all back together again for them."
358,"I think this is my first review ever in IMDB, but after watching this film I just could not help it. The viewing experience was just incredible. Wonderful animation, beautifully done. Nice story line. Would not recommend it for really young kids, thought. I consider this to be a rather PG movie since some of the scenes are darker than what you would expect in a children movie. Having said that, I consider this to be one of the best animation movies I have seen in a long time. It is a testament of what can be done when you are not tight to a Disney-like producing machine."
359,"A story of how Christmas came to be updated for a modern audience. I love the Rankin and Bass version of this story as much as the next guy but this movie does so much more. Santa has depth of character and the other characters work brilliantly. It's short, sweet and it doesn't insult your intelligence. Adding this to your holiday films is a must."
360,"Parents, please pre-screen this film. Don't just plop your kids down to watch only to come back here and complain later. There are many versions of how Santa Claus came to be. This one is more secular and had sort of a Nordic feel to it. The animation and the story are a little dark.
Some kids find this kind of thing scary, and the different story can be confusing for some.I enjoyed it. Animation style was great and the story was positive. Basically, circumstances may drag you down, but you can strive to be your best, overcome them, and do some good in the world.I think it was a job well done, and appreciated the different take on the story."
361,Something new refreshing about a Christmas story. A story about a postman who did anything in his power to leave a place and started to invent Christmas. A bit dark in the beginning of the place he was sent to the turned into happiness in the end. The emotions that the animation lefts to the audience is more grown ups as i experienced from my side.
362,"""Klaus"" is the rare Christmas film I can recommend to any friend who likes horror films and action movies because of its many zany, action filled sequences. Also, totally wholesome to boot, with spiritual snow and reconciliating enemies as well as a love story and a tale of moral redemption. . . wow! Plus, the animation is top notch, the character acting full of personality, squash and stretch, and the character design being fun and fitted to the voice acting, which was good too. . .The animation and character design did have a very Disney-esque feel, and it makes sense because of Sergio Pablos who wrote directed the film worked on Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, and Tarzan. There was also the animation master James Baxter (who animated Rafiki in The Lion King, Belle in Beauty and the Beast, Shrek 2, etc) who contributed animating some scenes himself while also taking an overall supervising role, I believe. The film is produced by Sergio Pablos Animation Studios (SPA Studios). In a Polygon interview Pablos writes the animation style of ""Klaus"" was definitely influenced by his time at Disney, however he hopes future works from his animation studio might take on its own unique style.Part of the reason you might feel as I did that ""Klaus"" looks like the old Disney 2D films like Beauty and the Beast is beacue ""Klaus"" is entirely 2D animated. This means all animation was hand drawn. But Pablos also says ""I set out to demolish some of the technical limitations (of 2D animation) as much as we can. Because we've had new technology that we haven't tried to use in 2D, so I was like let's give it a try and see what happens. The goal was to keep all that was great about 2D but replace what was not necessarily a choice but a limitation. So it would feel old but new somehow. But there was no attempt ever at making 2D look more like 3D. . . . The intention was to make this look like a piece of visual development that you that you would find in an art book for an animated movie, but put it directly onto the screen without getting into the grinder of the usual look.""Saying that, ""Klaus"" definitely has a colorful, vibrant, high end animation look, with high definition ultra smooth colors as well as nostalgic character designs that feel familiar. Some scenes are especially stunning, as like near Klaus' house with them magical snow. There is also definitely that art book, textured painting look that Pablos mentions for most of the film.An unexpected hit for me, and way more complete story wise than most Netflix films has been so far (personally). Well done!"
363,"For me it's an aged 8+ But it keeps the
Magic which I love. It's right up there with the original Santa Claus movie. Love it"
364,"Originally, I came into this movie 2/3 through. I found it delightful and positive! Today, however, I watched the entire film. I felt that the lead-up was very long (and a little scary), compared to the rest of the film. Were it not for this, I would make it a yearly viewing. On another note, I loved the Saami references. A hearty ""well done"" is in order, for that."
365,A really well made movie with a story that can be enjoyed by kids and grown ups equally. Everything from Christmas has a meaning and a purpose and it doesn't feel forced. Congratulations to Netflix for doing this high quality animation movie.
366,"Spoiled rich kid Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) gets sent by his father to Smeerensberg, a remote island far north, a violent and hostile place where two feuding families rule the town, and use a battle bell (tied to a gallows) to start fighting. Eventually, Jesper meets a burly old woodsman named Klaus (JK Simmons), who looks a lot like Jethro from 'The Prince of Egypt', whom Jesper convinces to make toys to give to the town's children so that Jesper can turn a profit as a postman and get back home to his comfortable life. Of course, the two end up saving the town and Jesper starts to care and then the same old liar-revealed-and-redeemed plot happens.
The film is beautiful. The colours and the light are masterfully done.
Jesper reminds me somewhat of Gwizdo from 'Dragon Hunters'. Both are anti-heroes who are in it for the money but have hearts of gold buried underneath. However, Jesper is not very well designed. He looks like Dr. Doppler from 'Treasure Planet'. Gwizdo's design is more interesting in that his face is shorter and wider. Sometimes Jesper looks OK but then he starts grimacing and it becomes really unappealing. And while Jesper is a spoiled brat forced into a harsh work environment, Gwizdo grew up poor, is constantly broke and he and his buddy have to look for work where they can find it.
The other characters, however, have excellent designs. The leaders of the towns look really cool. There's a cute little girl who can only speak Saami. There's a predictable third act twist and a forced romance that doesn't work. Norm McDonald steals the show as Smeerensberg's savvy ferryman.
The film is rated PG and for a good reason. There are some dark and scary moments in the film, and quite a bit of dark comedy (again, there's a hanging joke, but with a bird house instead of a birdcage, or rather a scallop cage). Usually these days 'PG' means ""Practically G"" so this is a surprise.
Ultimately, this is a very poignant film about an unlikely friendship. I recommend it."
367,"We just happened to come across this on Netflix and gave it a try. Very quickly it moves from ""oh here's ANOTHER cutesy animated film trying desperately to contrive feelings of Christmas magic"" to ""Oh my gosh, this is hilarious!"" This movie is genuinely funny, excellently illustrated and quite possibly the most original Santa Claus story I've ever seen. The character of Klaus as this massively manly woodsman living out in the cold backwoods and friends only with the wildlife was so cool! The story of the fighting villagers was so full of little funny details and had my wife and I literally laughing out loud. It also has some heart wrenching moments that I won't spoil here."
368,"Ahh, simply marvellous! Another classic to watch every year for Christmas. In the vein of 'The Polar Express' and 'Arthur Christmas', this is a beautiful story with wonderful characters and great animation. It might not be your conventional Father Christmas, but this film tells the story of how it all began. The film also tells us who he was before becoming Father Christmas, or Santa - a regular family man who suffered a sad loss.This is a truly awesome, inspiring, uplifting and delightful film young and old will enjoy and treasure for many years to come. Absolutely beautiful! I really can't even criticize the film in any way; I loved it!"
369,This movie was a lot of fun and so beautiful effects! The story is really nice and have a good and impactful message! :) everyone should see this lovely Christmas movie! :)
370,"It's amazing, magical, funny and has feels in all the right places! Great cast that do a wonderful job of filling this very eclectic town full of life!
Wow! Nothing bad to say about this movie! Just watch it! Not to mention it is beautifully illustrated, and it flowed like a magical warming elixir into my heart. I have watched a lot of holiday movies but this one is special and stands out as something that I would watch with my kids and someday my grandkids."
371,I loved this movie. There's a magic the characters that brought me back to my childhood. It was was original enough while still remaining true to the story of Santa Clause. The film was an escape from reality that you don't often get as an adult. Would definitely recommend.
372,"I would easily add this to my list of regular holiday movies to watch. The story is sweet, the humor is great, and it is a heartwarming tale for the family.
On a technical note the animation is stunning and unlike anything I've seen before. I think my only real criticism is the climax itself which felt out of place, though I am unsure why."
373,"Wholesome, warm and packs a great message. You should definitely watch this for christmas"
374,"Beautiful animation, story, laughs, music! Wow! Incredible movie. Well done Netflix, we will watch this every year from now on."
375,"Although it is cheap production , as most of netflix movie s , this is one of the best animated movie aftr Disney Coco which touches you , weather you are young .. or old üòä no matter your age u will love this masterpiece and sometimes you may find your tears coming out specially the windy wife scenes"
376,"I've seen so many tweets about this movie but I didn't consider watching it until a friend recommended it to me, and honestly I'm glad she did..
This movie gives me a feeling of warmth I haven't received in a very long time from an animation.
Not a big fan of Christmas movies because I'm not a Christian so I can never get into the ""spirit"" but this made me view it from a whole other perspective, it really goes deep into the real meaning of Christmas and not just lights and decorations and eye candy, Ive watched it twice already and I'm welling to do it again, aside from the stunning visuals & very catchy songs.
The idea of the movie is just so close to my heart, society especially children should not be suffering from old traditions & habits, and that idea was perfectly executed.
Not too corny & not too serious, a little bit sarcastic & very touching.
Loved it."
377,"I couldn't wait to see this one after seeing the teaser and official trailer (I preferred the original teaser than the Netflix version). After seeing it, I can definately agree that that it is good..........
But it's not as good as the critics are making it out to be.Story: Jesper, a bratty and entitled guy (which is different from the teaser) is sent to Smeerensberg after flunking the Royal Postal Academy. He is tasked with delivering 6,000 letters or else, he will be cut off from the family. Once he arrives however, he finds out that 2 families are at war with each other and have been for a long time due to ""tradition"" (*sigh*). He then comes across a former toy-maker named Klaus. After being made to deliver a toy to one of the kids, Jesper offers to deliver the toys that he has for free. They team up and thus the legend starts to form. Sadly the 2 families notice this and team up to stop them.The characters was pretty much the low point for me. Almost all of the characters, barring Klaus are just bland and cliche. ESPECIALLY JESPER. He's your usual entitled brat in the first act but gets better throughout the entire movie. He's pretty much Kuzco from Emperor's New Groove but even more unlikable and way less funny. Oh and WAY MORE ANNOYING. Even Flushed Away, despite the main character not being a brat handled this masterfully as well as another trope which I'll get to in a moment.I also like almost all of the casting except for Jason Schwartzman whose voice I didn't like. I liked the teaser and comparing it to the first act of Klaus, I honestly find the teaser more compelling.The 2D ANIMATION IS BEAUTIFUL. I'm glad that this kind of animation is back and I hope that Dreamworks and Disney pick it up again.It does get better in the second act with Jesper starting to like the changes to the town with the people becoming nicer and the town looking more friendly.But then the ""other trope"" I teased earlier kicks in and thus starts the worst moment in the entire movie. They find out Jesper's true plan and abandon him as he leaves. Yes, I'm talking about the infamous ""liar reveal"" cliche. I would usually forgive it if it was handled really well or even subverted at that point, but here it was executed so blandly and so forcefully that I nearly turned off the movie by then. EVEN KLAUS abandons him despite seeing how genuinely sorry he is and how much he has changed.The score was good but the song choices were weird. It made me feel like I was watching a Guy Ritchie movie.So overall this is a beautiful movie with heart but at the same time, its annoying and bland for the majority of the movie."
378,"The quirks, the wits, and the clear self-awareness in writing carry the movie a long way, but the massive amount of cliches and shameless use of one-dimensional ""bad guys"" in the narrative made the work seem less genuine than it otherwise could have been. The brilliant reflections that characters go thru during the run are surprisingly well-planned and executed, but then again, those overly gimmicky tropes in the plot make it seem like the writer was talented enough to avoid them and create something more original and sincere, but just decided not to. Very weird decisions were made here and I cannot fully approve them. An okay movie but nothing more."
379,"A heartwarming movie, that tells the legend of santa claus. It's a beautiful told movie for the cold time of the year and it really brings you the christnas Spirit. What is missing for a higher rating is the magic from other christmas classics, you know, just a bit more fairy tale."
380,"'Functional' is the perfect word to describe ""Klaus"". Its story fits the standard three-act mould so exactly it could have been written by an algorithm. Watch the first ten minutes and you have seen the film.Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) is the only son of a postal service magnate (a funny concept, I'll admit) and leads the good life, counting on his family's fortune to keep him comfortable for the rest of his days. After the umpteenth failure to get him to work, his father is fed up with Jesper's indolence and sends him to the remote Northern town of Smeerensburg to set up a postal office. If he doesn't process 6,000 letters before the end of next year, he can forget about his inheritance.The assignment is more than a harsh one. When Jesper arrives at Smeerensburg, those parts of the town he can see through the mist are decrepit and hostile. He discovers the population is divided between two clans, at war with each other since the stone age. The surviving villagers are too busy pestering each other to greet their new postman, let alone invest in epistolography.Jesper is close to dying of misery when he encounters an old woodcutter named Klaus (J.K. Simmons), who finds a drawing from one of the unhappy village children. Klaus enlists Jesper to bring the boy one of the toys he keeps in his workshop, planting the seed of an idea. What if more children were to write this Klaus for toys?If you have ever seen a film in your life, you know how it goes from there. Will Jesper and Klaus set up a booming business, perhaps through a montage or two? Will they have a fall-out when Jesper oversteps his boundaries? Will they team up again in the face of danger? Will the rival clans finally reconcile? Will there be an unbearable 'liar revealed' moment when it is found out Jesper was only trying to reach his delivery quota? I daren't spoil it for you.There are three things ""Klaus"" has going for it. First, Schwartzman and Simmons, who share an assured sense of comedy that occasionally elevates the dialogue. Second, the animation, which could easily have been of the mind-numbing Illumination type, but has a sharpness and gravity that you rarely find these days. And third, the slapstick, which is spot-on.Such a shame these qualities are stapled to a script that feels like it was written by a somnambulist. It isn't even bad, just never more than functional.With the exception of some pop songs that will age as gracefully as a snowman come spring, ""Klaus"" is a competently made film. Your kids will like it fine. Set them to watch it and you'll have a peaceful hour and thirty minutes to spend on your model train set. Make them a TV dinner while you're at it. No need to challenge their taste."
381,"This movie is one of the great animation of all time. Specially it being a Christmas movie makes it even better. It slowly takes you in to the world and without you even knowing it you're inside. I'm sure this will win an Oscar, yes its that great. If you're in to animation movies or Xmas movies watch this one. You will not be disappointed. Keep it going Netflix."
382,"Klaus is the definition of a a hidden gem, we could talk about the groundbreaking animation (handdrawn but with chi lighting that gives it that unique feeling) or the great cast, or the multicultural group of creators, but truly the story is to well told and captivating that nobody cares about all those wonderful things. Funny and emotional at the same time, it's been a while since I cried as much and ended with a bigger smile. A true gem"
383,I've cried at least 6 times during this film. It's amazing
384,Great storyline and animation! Very pleased with this Christmas movie being original and not full of cheesy cliches. Will definitely becoming a new yearly Christmas movie for me.
385,"A tear-jerker at every turn, one of the most beautiful movies I've ever had the honor of experiencing. If you are even slightly on the fence about seeing this movie..don't be. You'll regret not watching it."
386,"Love everything from the story, the art to the music ! Best movie ever for Xmas ‚ù§"
387,"I guess it's just the season , but the corny story of kindness just kindles my heart, we should all remember to be kind, it's just so easy to be self serving and mean towards others, even fake kindness takes more effort."
388,"I like Home Alone. I am not a monster, after all. I irrationally love the movie Jingle All The Way...Die Hard is alright too. But Christmas movies are usually about as irredeemable to me as Christmas music, so count me out.So, I say this with a lot of candor when I recommend watching this one, despite my first inclinations to say otherwise. On the off chance you are in the mood for a creative spin on a wellworn holiday story, you might as well polevault past Thanksgiving and into Christmas - because apparently it's good marketing to release Netflix Originals about Christmas before Turkey Day.I didn't really find it all that funny or heartwarming, but I was impressed almost every step of the way in other areas, so there's that."
389,"I got to give credit where its due. Animation is amaizng, and some concepts are clever at some points. But it falls victim to so many cliches. But its a christmas movie, what to expect. Its just not my style.5/10: generic, but not awful"
390,"Produced by Netflix and boasting a European type animation.Klaus is a Scandinavian tinted Santa Claus origin story.Jesper (Jason Schwartzman) is a spoilt brat. A layabout, his annoyed father sends him to a remote frozen island of Smeerensburg to establish a postal service.The island is backwards with feuding clans who like to do things the old way. Jesper persuades a gruff old woodsman Klaus (JK Simmons) to exchange his carved wooden toys to children who have written to him telling how good they have been.The kids by writing letters could be Jesper's escape from the island and return to his life of luxury. The local clan are annoyed by all the presents being given out to some of the kids.Klaus is a return to the more traditional animation even though co-director Sergio Pablos was involved with the CGI animated Despicable Me franchise. I did find Jesper a little too annoying and painted out to be too much of a slacker dude by Schwartzman.The film is a grower although the story is predictable. The ending has the right amount of sentimentality and Simmons gives a better judged performance as Klaus."
391,"This is pretty good, especially if you're watching it with the family"
392,I watch the beginning of this film and just thought- nah I have to watch this with family. Honestly I couldn't wipe the smile of my face throughout the entire film and me and my dad are massive movie buffs and were white judgy when watching something but this was just so sweet and it made me genuinely so happy.This was so much better then frozen which was decent but overrated and frankly frozen didn't make me cry tears of joy- this did
393,Enough said. This will be watched atleast once a year for the rest of my life.
394,"I'm rigidly cold as ice mother f....r guy atheist too but during and also after i watched this movie i felt..i don't know what it was but i felt something that i never felt in a long time, i never thought an animated movie will make me feel so weird"
395,"For what seemed to be ""just another Christmas movie"" at first, this charming animated feature really surprised me with it's beautiful hand-drawn visuals and crisp character movement. It's dialogue is brazenly filled with witty jokes that never get old and the voice actors are chosen well. The story is heart warming for a family film, not too simple and not overly complicated but otherwise tells it's own original Christmas origin story.The movie has actual real character development with no magical change-of-heart transformations like you see in Disney movies. In all honesty, this films is almost devoid of any considerable or obvious flaws, which is why it deserves a spot as one of the best Christmas movies I've ever watched.10/10"
396,"I'm watching right in this moment at this movie,is like the magic in the Christmas morning,so beautiful and warm,pure emotion and joy...one of the best movie of the year!"
397,Absolutely fantastic and out hairs on my neck up about time we had a new classic this is without doubt up there with xmas chronicles and even better superb!!!
398,"This movie is a piece of art. So what, boomer, if this isn't the real story of Christmas? This one is well written and very well executed.
Is it scary? Totaly not. I watched it with a 5,6 and a 10 year old kid that liked it a lot, fully understood it and never got scared.
I fully recommend this movie! It's awesome!"
399,"Totally original, a great movie!!!It's got everything that an animated movie should have and probably sends the best and most heartfelt Christmas message in ages."
400,"What a perfect movie to watch! Honestly, I saw the trailer and was not so surprised. But after a lot of recommendations I decided to give it a shot. Thank god I did. This movie made me feel like a child. And this is a difficult thing to do. I mean, it is fine we are all growing up to be decent members of society, but we all have the right to feel like little children on Christmas. This movie made this happen.
The story is original and clever, covering up everything we know about Santa Claus. The animation is breathtaking and the music is just outstanding. Even the voice actors were fantastic. What a movie to watch on Christmas Eve. It is definitely becoming a classic to watch every Christmas with family.
Because while Disney only cares about StarWars and Marvel yet, we have SPA and Netflix to bring new classics and leave us all stunned."
401,"Hands down one of my favorites. A really wonderful movie. I was blown away with how well it was done, but Netflix's ability to make great content continues. I would've happily taken the family to see that in a theatre. This will be a yearly seasonal watch."
402,A very good and charming film. He deserves to be nominated for an Oscar.
403,"WOW! Was I blown away by this one. At first I thought this would be your ordinary animated ¬´one in the crowd¬ª-movie, but this hand-drawn masterpiece is one one on a million. I can safely say this is one of the best animated flicks I've ever seen. Enjoy!"
404,"Heartfelt, charming and cute. What a wonderful story. Not to many times I want to tear up towards the end of a animated movie....but it almost happened."
405,"And this come from someone who worships Studio Ghibli and the like.When my husband and I saw the trailer right after it came out, we thought that it looked funny and we needed something silly and ""brainless"" to chill. How mistaken we were!From beginning to end, Klaus is captivating. Everything about this movie is perfect! The aesthetic hand-drawn animation combined with 3D tech, the quirky jokes, the beautiful story and many more! We laughed as hard as we cried.I never understand why people can watch the same movie for Christmas. Now I do. Because I'll definitely watch Klaus every Christmas from now."
406,Deserves to be a Christmas classic. Story makes sense for both adults and children. Warm & endearing in its own way. Would recommend.
407,What an amazing movie with a wonderful message. Near perfection. This movie will become a yearly Christmas tradition. Putting a non-magic human touch on the origins of Santa Claus and Christmas.
408,"Absolutely beautiful film, just what I needed really. Haven't felt very festive this year, (what with the state of our government and my low bank balance), but this film reminds us all that especially at this time of year a little kindness goes a long way. This got me right in the festive feels and it's left me feeling warm and hopeful. This has definitely become a new annual must see for me! Great for all ages too."
409,Something real and refreshing! Funny animation for the kids and entertaining for the adults. Loved it from start to finish. Great movie for getting into the Christmas spirit.
410,"Like another review I read here, I only turned this on as background noise to cook dinner and found myself sitting down due to the fabulous animation style. Reminded a little of Tim Burton but definitely it's own take on a dark type cartoon. I cried a few times and am happy to say this is my new favorite Christmas movie. It's wonderful, so cute and more than heartwarming."
411,"Utterly beautiful, sweet and true.
A work of art for and in all senses of the word.
The greatest and most touching telling of Santa Claus I have ever seen, When I have kids, this is what I'll show them."
412,"Wow. This was one of the best animated movies I have seen since my childhood. This is definately already a christmas classic for me, that I look forward in sharing with my kids one day.The best 90 minutes I have spent in a long time watching a movie. The animations, the scenery and the looks of this movie was just increadibly detailed and well made.Hats off! Im blown away right now."
413,"This was such a great movie. I must admit I didn't have great expectations because it looks like a bit of a dark cartoon. However, it turned out to be quite an endearing movie and touched on so many Christmas traditions and how they came about and I really just thoroughly enjoy the movie as a whole and I think it's going to become a Christmas tradition for a family"
414,"This movie is beautiful. Very touching.a wonderful new way of telling the story of Santa Claus .
The graphics are stunning ..The story had me in tears often as it quietly teaches good over evil ,love over hate .grudges should not be carried on for no reason except ,family says so ..
A wonderful watch for families ,and anyone !
‚ù§üíö‚ù§üíö‚ù§üíöüéÑüéÑüç≠"
415,Words can not describe this masterpiece.The only thing I do not understand is why are there so many 8 and 9's while the comments did not specify what they are lacking.Loved it! Watched it with my girlfriend and we both fell in love with the story and the animation style!
416,"Fun for the whole family. Jokes for adults, great story, fun and lovable characters, great art style, superb animations, just watch it!"
417,The movie was so beautiful that I almost cried out of happiness. A must watch with all the family members. This is truly a classic for years to come. Hats off to Netflix. Simply a magnificent movie.
418,"This film is truly original and avoids clich√©s of the genre. The story was great, as was the cast and artwork. I think this is a Christmas classic in the making and will be a staple holiday watch for families in years to come."
419,"I was skeptical but this movie had my inner child grinning, crying, and intrigued throughout. A creative take on a beloved character, do yourself a favor and watch this one. Your inner child will thank you."
420,"The story of Santa origin centered around Scandinavia, and their dark mentality and centuries old feuds. A postman comes to North and accidentally starts a Christmas tradition, first for the feuding Scandinavian locals, and then also for a Mongoloid Sami girl, who brings Santa helpers. Legend origins are given humorous interpretations, and the sappy message about spreading good deeds is hammered with little subtlety. Still, a decent animation with extra points for originality, showing how easy it is to reverse engineer narratives using alternative facts and logic."
421,"I like the movie, story is really cool, overall start to end there is nothing boring, love it."
422,Just put this on by chance and I'm so glad I did. Just an all-round fantastic film. Characterful with fantastic animation and an excellent plot. Lots of very funny and emotional moments. Can't remember the last time I enjoyed a film this much.
423,"I had my doubts to see her and I was surprised, very good"
424,"I just finished watching this. I don't normally review films that already have a lot of reviews but I just had to rave about this one. The animation is so beautiful and the story is so moving. It's not the first Santa Klaus origin movie I've seen - just for some background, I watch a million Christmas movies every year - but I think it might be the best. I quite literally teared up multiple times. I actually didn't realize what a big deal it was for Netflix - the budget and everything. But right away just from watching it I could tell it was a quality production - not just another made-for-TV holiday movie - and I really felt like it was crafted with love. I appreciated all of the rich relationships, like Jesper and Klaus and Jesper and the Saami girl. There was great character development for more than just our protagonist. And though his journey is a familiar one, particularly for a Christmas movie, it was an effective one. I honestly can't recommend this movie enough."
425,"What a great movie, not as advertised as it should, this is a movie to watch with your children, with all your family, it truly inspires you to be a better person."
426,In the beginning I was little sceptical. But what a Movie. One of the best Christmas Movies I've ever seen. Nearly Cried at the End. The Movie was made with so much passion. Just really recommend it to anybody.
427,Interesting animation and kind atmosphere. Great cartoon for kids. Christmas classic !
428,"Klaus was magical, heartwarming and truly captured what Christmas is. I couldn't recommend highly enough"
429,"Everything about this movie is great, best animated movie since UP or Wall E"
430,"Christmas has come yet again, and thus we get new christmas movies. I like all the classics, Santa Clause, Elf etc...but this was something totally different. A unique origin story. A totally new idea of how the most loved of all traditions began brought to us by Netflix.What a class piece of story telling it is. The 2D animation is actually hand drawn and is so lush and accomplished.Alas, as all these classics end up, I find myself in tears yet again.It is my new favourite christmas movie, and probably always will be."
431,"I've been a part of IMDb for a few years now, but never felt the need to write a review until now. But it has to be said how much I simply adored this Xmas classic.Everything from the gorgeous animation, the emotional storytelling and the memorable, lovable cast of characters make this a truly heart-warming adventure that'll bring a tear to your eye on more than one occasion.Do yourself a favour and make this a must-see film on your watchlist over the festive period. Bravo, Netflix. Bravo."
432,"Honestly one of the most touching Christmas movies I have watched in the longest time! Thank you to the writers, directors, actors and everyone involved for making such a special movie!"
433,A must watch.Klaus brings to the family a new and refreshing Christmas tale that is absolutely breathtaking. I cannot put into words the joy I have taken from watching this future beloved classic with my family. I am sure that this film will be played year after year with our other staple holiday movies.
434,"Very good and best...
thx u to make this story and animation. So beautiful in everything...""Goodness only come when someone try do something."""
435,"I loved the movie, I really enjoyed watching it.
The best Christmas story ever told. Netflix made an excellent work."
436,"This film is one of them few films you watch thinking that it's going to be okay, but by the end of it you're crying and wanting to watch it all over again.Think this is one of our yearly must watch Christmas film."
437,"This movie is awesome! First of all, they were beautifully animated. I love the tones, the concept, the story, the way they presented us 'the idea of Christmas' and the way they brought it alive. It was simply beautiful with good messages in which we can find it both enjoyable for adults and kids. For us adults, it might makes us reflect about several things. It is because, as an animated Christmas movie, I thought this one depicted story about Christmas quite realistic. It was not all about magic and miracle. It presented real ideas of human nature and real problem we might encounter in real life. There were several ideas I learned from watching this movie:1. Can human be nice and kind towards others out of goodwill? Or is human only acts according to the benefit of what they can get?2. War seems always born out of misunderstanding, the unwillingness to cooperate and tolerate differences, and sometimes out of the importance of several parties3. Love and forgiveness maybe is all we need to achieve peace4. One good act always incites another. It might moves or changes the heart of people. Sometimes, if there is no one, you can always be the first to try to do good deed.5. We can always learn and repent from our mistakesThat's all! Hope all of you, love this Christmas movie as much as I do. Happy early-Christmas :)"
438,"An brilliant concept on the origins of Santa Claus, funny, heartwarming and an all round excellent family film."
439,"Watching this movie reminded me a lot of the good classic christmas specials from 70s and 80s. Simple story, but beautifully done. The animation is fantastic! The main characters Jesper and Klaus were written well. I enjoyed it and could see this be another classic in the future. I hope this movie goes beyond netflix because its too good not to share time slots for more to see and for the message this movie brought."
440,Honestly a real take on how the legend on Santa Klaus took off. Very logical and sweet.
441,"Funny, cute adaptation of Christmas. Lovely characters, lovely story, beautiful scenes and very good music."
442,"It's hard to make me cry but I cried during this film, that is some achievement! It was a wonderful film. Watch it, you won't regret it."
443,A wonderful take on how Santa came about. Beautifully written and illustrated. My smile grew bigger as the story unfolded. I will be watching this every December along with the Polar Express and Scrooge. A must for young and old.
444,"Best new Christmas movie that I've seen in years. Excellent actors, excellent plot, excellent graphics. Children below 12 will probably be bored by it. If an adult doesn't love it, question their taste."
445,"How can an adult see this film and not admire an old rusty tale of good vs bad made in an old hand drawn style with modern humor. The story is old, Santa claus, christmas, joy and kindness triumphs evil, but somehow refreshing in the way it is told.
The story has not been modernized or kept as a wonder of magic and mystery but rather told as a tale of a craftsman with dreams of a family lost in sorrow from a loss no human wants to endure. This craftman get reminded of what joy feels like through a bratty postman who unconsciously shows him happiness in children's eyes when they get toys, toys Klaus wanted to make for his own children.Half of the movie is dark and grey and the story is as deep as an animated film possibly can be and small children might find it scary at times. But it's an old story told in a beautiful way with humor and warmth."
446,The art is surprisingly good and the story is better than i expected the trailer doesn't give the movie it's shot ...... the sound tracks are well selected ..... the jokes are well played... totally would recommend to every one no matter what age they are !
447,"I am well shocked with this amazing and wonderful story. I cried since the middle of the movie. I love Christmas, its my birthday, for me is the most magical day. when I was a kid some bully kids told me that Santa doesn't exist, they broke my heart, and today I was crying remembering how I dream and I believed in Santa. Thank you very much, sincerely, thank you, this is my best gift ever to believe again, to dream, to have faith that amazing things could happen. Thank you for create magic with this story! Blessings for all of you and your beloveds. Happy Christmas!"
448,Very beautiful. Nice story. Nice graphics. This one stays with me for a while.
449,"I couldn't stop crying, I loved it.
So beautiful story and animation."
450,We need more movies like this one for the holidays that reminds us what is really about. Definitely a must watch before christmas
451,A beautiful magical film. Like many other reviewers I'm writing this with tears in my eyes. This is a new classic. I know I will be watching this again before Christmas.
452,A beautiful little movie. Lovingly illustrated with a heart warming story to soften the hardest of hearts. A little masterpiece. Joyful and uplifting.
453,"Wonderful and heart-warming Christmas time fairytale with a positive message, great animation and art-work"
454,"One of those animated movie that will make you laugh and cry at the same time!
Wonderful to watch with your kids.
It has the best colors of winter."
455,"What a perfect movie to get you and your family in the spirit for what's important about Christmas!
Loved this film, as did my whole family!"
456,"1 film about creative and interesting Christmas, bringing a lot of value in life. It's been a long time since I've seen an animated movie that is so appealing and gives me as much emotion as this movie"
457,Believe the hype. This film is great. Well done Netflix!
458,One of the best christmas movie. This story brings happiness to everyone. Simple story but it is described in a heart touching way. Realy I love this movie.
459,"Since this dropped on Netflix, my family and I have watched this movie 6 or 7 times. Every, single, time is just as good as the last one! The storytelling, the background, the plot, the music, this movie is a masterpiece! Please watch it! You'll love it just like I do. A Christmas gem!"
460,"This movie warmed my hearth, just what a Christmas movie is suppose to do.The story is so clever and tender, perfect for children, really good movie, the animation is great."
461,This was unusual and unexpected twist in a Christmas story.... so brilliant story telling that keeps you locked on from the start till the end ... emotional ride is beautiful and sparks a positive energy inside you ... this is definitely a new Christmas classic that I will watch every Christmas morning with my family including some old ones like the Grinch and others...
462,"I was really surprised and happy with how much I liked this movie. The animation is cool, feels somehow old and new at the same time. The voice acting was great. I found the origin story of Christmas from a different perspective was great.It was a little predictable, the hero's problem is introduced early in the movie and about half way through you can kind of see where this is going but it didn't take away from my enjoyment.There are some sad scenes that add to the whole emotional tie to the movie which I found very entertaining. Would recommend this to kids and adults."
463,"This is a real Christmas movie!
Absolutely loved it from beginning to end! The characters, the animation, the humour and the emotional touches make this such a one of a kind Film, it really is unlike any Christmas movie I've seen before.
Explaining the story behind Santa in an innovative and very funny way makes you just want to rewatch it again and again!"
464,"Absolutely wasn't expecting anything from this film.
What a breath of fresh air it was.
Love the way everything is tied in and the heart warming feeling you get during and after watching it.
A future classic for sure.
I can't do the film any real justice In these few short sentences.
Watch, watch and watch it again."
465,Honestly Its an amazing movie I recommend everyone to watch it!
466,"I love it. Yes, the story sounds a bit fishy and annoying. But it is fun to watch. The music in this movie is impressive. This movie is not only for children; One strong message shown in this movie for elders.
If you're a fan of such animation movies, then Netflix Kalus the perfect film for you."
467,It tugs at the heart.The movie was beautiful and funny. I was not expecting myself to get into it as much as I did. Had to tell my kids to move their heads a few times.
468,Wouldnt it be wonderful if we learned to spread kindness again? a wonderful wonderful movie. bring tissues when watching.highly recommend
469,"I was extremely and pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie! Expecting it to be another one of those made-for-streaming animated Christmas movies, I just turned it on to have something playing in the background while I worked. After about 20 minutes, I found myself watching it more than working and pausing it when I had to leave the room for a few seconds. Now I'm about to watch it again from the beginning to enjoy the whole thing but wanted to write this short review before I did. This may just replace Polar Express as my favorite modern animated Christmas movie!"
470,Great movie. Will be watching this again and again.
471,"Klaus is mainly the origin story of the fabled Santa Klaus, but it actually tells the story of so many others as well. Take it for an example, the story of Jasper the postman. His story is the reflection of all of us who are lost in life and are trying to get somewhere where we think we belong to. But sometimes we are so blind that we cannot see that we are already in the place where we are needed the most. And we saw the beauty of love. A little act of kindness can bring joy to so many lives- this is the biggest reminder of this movie. Whoever made this movie goddamn made me cry!"
472,This movie is beautifully animated and moving-an instant classic! The story is intricate and very well thought-out. I'm so happy to have such a wonderful new classic to add to the list of must-see movies of the Holidays.
473,"""A true act of goodwill always sparks another""Simply beautiful, fun and emotional. Just finished it and i think Klaus is not only the best animated Christmas movie of all time, its become one of the best movies of all time now for me. This is not just a Christmas movie, this is a movie for everyone from every religion, kids and adults alike. There is a BIG lesson for adults in this. The moral and the impact of the story will leave you in an awe and at times overwhelmed. Such beautifully crafted script with some amazing animation. Trust me, if you like animated movies or even just want to see an absolutely heart warming movie, put this in your next to watch list right now. This is unmissable."
474,"Fantastic animation, beautiful message to kids, good soundtrack, story was nearly perfect. Overall would highly recommend!"
475,"This beautifully animated film dares to be different, with its own unique and wonderful story that is full of heart, hope, humour and gloriously free from Christmas clich√©s. By far one of the best Xmas films in years and a breathe of fresh air in any festive film line-up!"
476,Amazing christmas movie <3 Hole family happy time movie!
477,"Beautifull tale, just need cooking and milk to enjoy"
478,"Touched my heart... Very VERY VERY GOOD... Loved all of it, it has heart, love, drama.... And the best of all. a real SANTA........ LOVE IT"
479,"Osm movie with very unique story of a santa claus.
Don't listen haters all i can say It is a must watch movie."
480,"In every single way - story, animation, actors... best Xmas film in years"
481,"This movie was not overworked. The writers kept it simple and relatable and hilarious. So many plot twist. It felt like watching the back story of Santa but with two leads!
While everyone knows the 'what', this movie gave us the 'Why'. The story did not resolve around Santa Clause alone, Instead was about what Christmas is all about, peace and kindness and warmth and Love.
So original! Love it so much!!"
482,"Fantastic Christmas movie, the animation was great. Could have done without that awful song thrown in."
483,"Resfreshing story,difference from another klaus moviesüëçüëçüëç"
484,"Basically it's a movie for the whole family and answers beautifully to so many questions children might have. So it's basically educational. üòäGive that movie a shot, it's beautifully animated and has a sweet story."
485,"Close it, we already have the best christmas movie of this years. really beautiful art. pay a little attention enough and you'll be surprised for how great the scene was. Great story. Good balance between both 'side' of the main story. be careful you might need some tissue to wipe those eye."
486,"This movie took me by surprise tonight. If you have kids I urge you to show them this, it's beautifully animated and has a great message behind it. 10/10."
487,The story line of the movie was just amazing. And it is a good movie to watch with family.
488,"It was so beautiful!
I think I'll watch it every year."
489,"The animation is good but the story is boring the first good part of it at least. Humour is the usual and repetitive stuff you find on American shows for children with the central character getting it wrong all the time until he becomes a better person. Usual tropes abound. Pathetic and annoying most of the time.
Children (whom I am not) may be more forgiving towards the story"
490,"I thouroughly enjoyed the animation and unique take on this Christmas story. The voice acting was great. It has a good pace. There is not much to hate here, but I certainly won't be watching this every Christmas season."
491,"My biggest fault in years was to think this was going to be another Xmas movie with lame animation and an undeveloped Story only worthy for watching in order to calm the children down. I was completely wrong. This movie, as a whole, and in every scene is an irreplaceable masterpiece in its own right.
Maybe the best spanish movie in the last 30 years. You will laugh, you will be scared, you will be touched to tears and, after the credits and after the tears, you will smile and believe in humankind again. It will be the Xmas Classic of this generation."
492,This is an amazing Christmas movie which makes you re-watch some of the best scenes. I expressions are ultimate. I loved some of scenes especially where Ms. Krum comes with an evil plan and Mr Ellingboe asks a foolish question which irritates Ms. Krum. A must watch Christmas movie.
493,I really enjoyed the story and the animation. It is also refreshing seen good quality movies on Netflix.
494,A true masterpiece. Better than many Disney movies. A must watch for Christmas. Highly recommended !
495,A must watch. Classic Christmas family movie time.
496,"Perfect christmas movie, I cried :)
Forget Santa Clause, this is the best :)"
497,Such a lovely heartfelt film that will give you proper goosebumps a must watch!
498,"Just awesome movie... Story line , suspence , perfect movie .. awesome üòç"
499,I'm not much for christmas but this film is just too good for me to ignore. Hope they make more origin stories like this heart warming masterpiece.
500,"A great movie for young and old, I loved it , the kids loved it."
501,I dont celebrate Xmas but this film hit me so hard man
502,I watched it with my son. What a beautiful story. I loved the song at the end. Great work ones again from Netflix.
503,I created a user just to give this movie a 10/10! Hands down one of the best movies I have ever watched!
504,"Just fantastic mix of emotions, comedy and a great story.The must watch christmas movie!"
505,"Love, love the storyline and plot! My son as well my entire family loved it. We watched it together. IMDB 10 for me!"
506,"A different origin story for Santa Klaus, and one that children and young kids will relate to. It has hidden gems for kids, such as that they, even though they are kids and small, can change their communities and hence the world. But all the positive messages are subtle and very well placed throughout the movie. The final lesson... the final phrase uttered in the movie is for us adults. You'll understand it when you see it. Great family movie."
507,"Seemed to be a community with hundreds if not thousands of children yet a classroom only fits 12 students and there is only one teacher, totally UNREALISTIC!!.. otherwise an incredible feastive treat which is as wonderfully wholesome as it is hilarious, the rare but perfectly timed injections of licenced sountract are a particular delight. A must watch festive film, best of the lot."
508,"Finally! A DECENT - no, nay, an EXTRAORDINARY new Christmas movie!!After all the trash I've been forced to watch this year - it's been worth it to get to this gem!Screw you and your Hallmark movies wife! In your face!! üñïI mean, it's not Hallmark - so it's got to be better, but Netflix has not been a whole lot better this year until now!Back to 2D animation in all its glory - sometime the 3D stuff can just be to much. It's a new take on the Santa origin story, and I have to say it's a new favourite of mine. If I had kids this is how I would say Santa was created. And then blame him if they didn't like what I got them ...The story has humour, warmth, conflict, resolution, romance and love - and it even might have made me tear up a bit at the end..If you haven't watched it yet then I highly recommend it. It's on Netflix - check it out - cause it gets the first (and probably only) 10 trees out of 10!"
509,Loved it at first I was like wth is going on this is creepy but by the time I got to the middle I was smiling it made me so happy when they started doing good and by the end I was crying I was so glad Klaus found his family. This is exactly the message our world needs to hear right now . A small good deed will spark many more . üòä
510,"The film offers a unique take on the Santa Claus legend. It's kind of a mash-up of ""Santa Claus Is Coming To Town"" and ""Hatfields vs. McCoys."" There's a version of Burgermeister Meisterburger (played by Joan Cusack). I only typed that because I wanted to type Burgermeister Meisterburger and maybe you'll read it aloud.This movie was better than I thought it would be. My opinion of Netflix-produced content was way down in the dumps after watching the really terrible, really awful ""Rim Of The World."" Now I may actually keep the streaming service.""Klaus"" is entertaining and worthwhile. Watched it with my whole family (wife and tween kids). Really a visual holiday feast too, which is the aspect that i appreciated the most. It never really lets you down."
511,This movie was truly an international production! What a small world. We need to remember that theme. One act of kindness will produce another! Our world needs to take heed of those words. Hats off to Netflix for giving us this act of kindness. Thank you and Merry Christmas!
512,"Klaus (2019), being distributed by Netflix as its first original animated feature, is truly a phenomenal animation of the year with the visual art, soundtracks, characters and especially the plot that can surpass many of your expectations on an Indie animated movie. It is remarkable that, in my opinion, it can surpass many of Pixar's movies and be a potential candidate if not the winner for the upcoming Oscar's Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film."
513,I literally just signed in to review this masterpeice. Grab a pack of tissues before watching though.
514,Such a sweet film that made me feel so happy inside. I cried so so much at the ending that I honestly feel dehydrated now. I love this film do much after watching it just once.
515,"It's a different take on the Santa origin story - but, my word, it's great. My kids thought it was funny and touching - I freaking loved it. It's not sappy or anything like that, and really pulls out a positive message.
If you've been forced to watch Mickey's Once Upon A Christmas or The Polar Express repeatedly, this will be something soothing and enjoyable!"
516,"I genuinely only gave it a nine because I'm sure there's something wrong with it I just can't figure out what.And seriously i've thought about this, I have zero complaints how is that even possible. We live in a world where complaints grow on trees and I don't have any. It's kind of infuriating, like, I'm gonna go kick a puppy so I can complain about the fact that somebody kicked a puppy: just because I have no complaints about this movie.Ps. No animals were harmed during the production of this review"
517,I wanted to like this movie because it's really well done. And it shows the kindness at Christmas. However it is to completely secularist. The reason for Christmas was completely left out. It's all about the toys. He said in the movie that we will call this day Christmas. But there was no reason given for why it was called Christmas. it's sad that I'm the only one that has noticed this. The reason for celebration is the birth of our Saviour. But I suppose beliefs in this modern society is old-fashioned. Why in the world should we teach our children that? Even my son who is an agnostic noticed that very thing..
518,"The cinematic equivalent of a cup of Hot Chocolate.
This thing's sweet, heartwarming, and just an animation wonder.
I found myself shouting ""OH LOOK AT THAT OH LOOK AT THIS OH GOD!"" during multiple shots.
Genuinely wish I could've seen it on the biggest possible screen.
It's like The Emperor's New Christmas Groove, and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out."
519,"Netflix started out its film ventures on shaky ground. They are seriously turning that around. This is another solid production from Netflix that is ""woke free"". No sexism, no politics, just good story telling.For Netflix to stay relevant, they need to keep on top of good film making. If they produce non-politically motivated hits that appeal to the majority like Klaus does, Netflix stand a chance to compete against Disney+ and HBO. If they keep up their ""woke"" productions, Netflix will alienate many customers (the silent majority).The first 1/3 of this movie is quite painful to watch as a one dimensional character in a one dimensional world become fleshed out. By the end, you grow to love and care about these characters.This film is suitable for most ages. Minor scenes may be scary for the very young."
520,"Storyline: uninspired.
Design: awesome and unique :)
Voice acting: convincing.
Entertainment: so so.Must See: definitely not."
521,"I really wish people who put together kids movies would use proper grammar. ""Less presents, less weight"" is one abhorrent example. Fewer presents, less weight. If you're going to get all preachy about social problems, then maybe don't add to the mis-education of children. Also, the animation style where the characters are all grossly out of proportion is just that: gross."
522,"This movie was unexpectedly good.
I loved the settings (the little village with rivalry between two houses) and how the popular beliefs were created by misunderstanding (see the flying magical reindeer and many others).
I've found interesting and deeply sad also the background story of mr. Klaus, and Jesper kinda remember me disney's Kuzco (selfish and spoiled) in a positive way.Towards the end, when the 2 families went to burn toys at Klaus home, the old matriarch said that without toys the kids would be returned to old habit: I wonder if wouldn't it be a powerful message destroy the toys for real and show the kids didn't care because they were changed thank you the ""one good thing brings another one"" philosophy."
523,"A demythologized origins story of Santa Claus just in time for Christmas. Finally, a story of how American capitalism and British class fears turned an agrarian seasonal occupation of gorging and reveling into a family-oriented tradition of gift-giving money to retailers in exchange for debt and junky toys and, then, blaming it on a white-bearded guy in the sky made up by Coca-Cola.Oh, wait, that's not what ""Klaus"" is about. Again, a mythologized supposedly-partially-demythologized story full of copious amounts of perniciously recycled, predictable and trite schmaltz. Netflix enters a time-honored Hollywood practice of gift-giving lousy Christmas movies in exchange for our money. From ""Miracle on 34th Street"" (1947) to ""The Santa Clause 3: The Escape Clause"" (2006), we keep receiving these stupid Santa movies. I prefer the simpler past, when ""Santa Claus"" (1898) was a one-minute film made to experiment with photographic multiple exposures. Now, Zara Larsson's mawkish ""Invisible"" music-video montage takes up more time than that in ""Klaus"" and without even an innovative effect.Why movie critics, who by definition one would think are supposed to think critically and to have seen this cinematic emotional blackmail time and again, turn into saps for this seasonal sentimentalism is rather perplexing, though (it holds a 93% certified-fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of this posting). I speculate it's for the same reasons that Santa Claus and modern Christmas exist in our imaginations at all--because they're so thoroughly stamped upon and become ingrained in the rituals of modern Western society. Regardless, after the initial set-up of a postman and a woodsman inhabiting a village enraptured in some absurd feud, the rest of the movie is so obviously reverse-engineered from the usual Santa Claus narrative that it writes itself. The humor mostly consists of the postman being emphatic and frantic and trading anachronistic barbs with others, such as the ""snail mail"" line. Even that is preferable to the waterworks manipulation. On the other hand, the animation, including some traditional hand drawing, is pleasant enough, and the pacing isn't too bad.It's interesting, too, that Netflix released ""Klaus,"" as the picture employs largely-antiquated animation in the digital age to mythologize the same snail mail that was the backbone of the company's original DVD-rental business. That, of course, has since changed with Netflix sliding down our chimneys through the seemingly-ethereal streaming. Even the postman sits expectantly in his living-room chair. Plus, they give us the gift of their own junk now. ""A true act of goodwill,"" surely. Bah humbug."
524,"Where did these reviews come from? How much did Netflix pay for that?We love Christmas, we love Christmas movies, we're in need of a new classic... Thus isn't it.My 4 year old cried, it was that bad. Hence the rating. Just awful."
525,Wasn't too sure what to expect because the graphics looked old school in the previews and the movie had some really dark undertones but turned out to be a good story. A lot of people saying they are ranking this as a must see every Christmas but I'm not sure I would watch it again.
526,"A trickle down raegonomics myth-deconstruction breaking and entering trope-fest which is built by ye olde scheme so it ends up hitting itself in the face by contradicting its ""messaage"".""How could it be so? It came due to ribbons! It came due to tags! It came only with packages, boxes and bags!"" And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was sore. Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before! ""Maybe Christmas,"" he thought, ""does come from a store. Maybe Christmas... perhaps... means nothing more!"" And what happened then? Well... in Whoville they say, that the Grinch's small heart shrank three sizes that day!"
527,"This film start with a cadet ""Jesper"" order by his father to be a postman on an island(Smeerensburg) scene! As turnout, this film is about Jesper team up with a toymaker ""Klaus"" to encourage the people on the island to write a letter in return with a toy! Entire film full of overuse scene! Such as, overuse of Jesper mumbling scene! Super annoying! Overuse of the tripping scene! Overuse of the havoc scene! Barely laughable scene is, Klaus give a rope to Jesper to hang a birdhouse, he hang himself instead! At the end, after 12 years working with Jesper, Klaus disappear into the wind to accompany his dead wife! At the very end, Jesper marry with Alva and saying every year of Christmas is to memorize Klaus! That's it! I can really tell, this film rating definitely is fake! Pathetic!"
528,"This movie starts slow, but when the boy meet with an old man whose name is klaus the movie gain its more interest .
So overall i like this movie as direction wise or entertaining , but at some points it has some weakness in ending and in middle.
Thanku"
529,The animation was pretty good. For me the story lacked. It was Hatfields and McCoys meets Cruella DeVille vs. sad Santa and a millennial. Did not feel like a Christmas movie. I wouldn't play this for my kids. They missed the mark on this.
530,"If you want your children to know the past, to remeber european history, to remeber who built the greatest civilization on our planet, to just know story of Saint Nicholas of Myra - do not show them this movie.
If you don't care about it and want your children to think that all the presents are from drunkard created in 1930 by Coca Cola just show them this another lie.
Original story of Saint Nicholas is way better whenever is it true or not so the only reason somebody makes it again is to sell something. And this time is not just another bottle of luscious drink."
531,"Let's start by addressing the title of this review: yes, I know ""Klaus"" is aimed at younger audiences but would it be so wrong with some all-family humor? Don't let this overshadow the overall good Christmas spirit. In the film, Jesper (voiced by Schwartzman) is spoiled and egoistic - not at all good postman material. Thus is he sent out to make his practice in Smeerensburg, a miserable village suffering from a conflict between the two groupings of citizens. It's a good setup, however, ""Klaus"" suffers a bit from predictable plot twists. I don't know how much to expect from a holiday movie but there are several positive sides of the film. The storybook Christmas feeling is present throughout the movie, and the director and writers aren't afraid of getting cheesy in the most charming way. The twist - in lack of better words - that the title character (voiced by J. K. Simmons) is the whole basis of our beloved modern Santa Claus and that the phenomena of Christmas is invented in the film is quite nicely made. The big plus with ""Klaus"" is that the director dared to make a traditionally animated movie. I highly appreciate this as most computer animated films - however good they might be - often lacks originality in their visual design. ""Klaus"" goes it's own way and that deserves some extra gifts in the stockings."
532,"My children did not enjoy the film at all. The story may be wonderful, but most of it was dark, angry and scary scenery."
533,"While it takes long to really get into the story it turns out in a nice story.
Gives a Disney vibe, but with rougher animations.The main character is not likable, but does grown on the viewer. There are some cute elements that really get you through.The plot will turn out exactly as your expect from the first 5min, but thne again this is definitely focused on the kids and it gives a new narrative (for many) to a very famous Klaus."
534,"This is what kids movies have came to lately. Melancholia and sadness and heartbreaks. But wait, this has been the theme of most animated kids movies for decades. Ok carry on!"
535,"This film was interesting, but not spectacular. I'll admit I was very impressed at how they told us the same Santa Claus story, but this time the origins are very different. On the other hand the the structure of the film is very cliche. It had the lazy protagonist which later on becomes better, it had love subject for hero, it had the structure of friends getting a huge row and break-up and reunion cliches. There are tons of more cliches which mkaes the story very unoriginal, but the whole idea of making Santa Claus origins so different is very admirable."
536,"Klaus tells AN origin story of Father Christmas, involving a post man, a selfish start, a woodsman, a loss, a teacher (Yay for teachers!) without a class, a village in turmoil for centuries, a family on the outskirts and how it all comes together to make the world a better place.The cast are not your usual animation names and that adds to the characters and the story, Rashida Jones, J.K Simmons and Joan Cusack are all fantastic actors who I'd much rather listen to than some of the so-called Hollywood A-List. Not that they are not successful actors and actresses in their own rights, but they have the ability to make you forget them as we know them and to bring the characters to life. Jason Schwartsman is Jesper, the main man (well main Postman) and though he sometimes sounds like Ryan Reynolds, he manages to take the character from dislikeable layabout to hero in a smooth transition.With the message, that a simple acts of kindness sparks another, this is a lovely little Christmas film, with a good heart, some nice humour and a film that the whole family will enjoy watching together. A brings a smile to your face 14/20."
537,"I wasn't expecting such a great movie! Oh my, the animation is astonishing! It's almost like Disney-quality or something similar.
The story is also very well written, sometimes so well it could give you tears.
The music is wonderful. Not anything special, but it fits well.Maybe one flaw is the predictable plot, but I really didn't care when I saw the movie. I really enjoyed it, every minute!"
538,"The first act of this movie is good, but the second act and the third act are disappointing.Generally, I hate family/animation and this movie did a great job of reminding me why. Nowadays, the animation genre is pretty conventional by its storytelling.In Klaus, the characters are not as beautifully written as they are drawn, the screenplay suffers by making the characters' evolution to quick/drastic, and all that is supposed to be explained by ""goodwill"", I sincerely didn't buy that short cut.In other words, I think that those pretty interesting characters became too generic and too flat by the ending of the movie. Unfortunately, this is also a trademark of the director, Sergio Pablos.I would say that my recommendation depends on what you expect from this movie. If you seek a good movie worthy of IMDb's top 250, then you have come to the wrong place."
539,"Interesting approach to the whole Santa and Christmas thing, I'd say it's pretty original and emotion packed from tears to laughter. Voice actors are great, animation is beautiful and the storytelling is amazing. You could watch this with family, your partner or friends even. Definitely recommend this beautiful little movie!"
540,"More meaningful and inspiring movie, and better music than Disney movie Frozen II."
541,I love that! It's emotional and can touch your heart. I hope will be produced more anime like this
542,Such a beautiful and relaxing movie which you can with your family in Christmas eve üéÑüéÜ
543,Beautiful movie!!! I absolutely loved it!!! A must see!!!
544,"This was a well done and surprising Netflix film, way to go in 2019 with animation between this and I Lost My Body"
545,If this movie doesn't move you go check with your doctor
546,"What a gem. Didnt expect this, but this one is a pure gem. For the whole family, dont miss it!"
547,I am happy to see like this movie in 2020. It was a long time to see beautiful movie for Christmas and this one bring good memories. Thanks Netflix üòä
548,"Thank god we got 2d animation back after the awful movies of 2013 to 2019 that were bad at storytelling and having the same plotline called""be yourself"" and plus its just dumb for these types of movies to exist but 2d animation has a good purpose for good plotline and story telling and this movie got it all.the animation,the story,voice acting and beutiful emotion of the experience and wonder."
549,"A beautiful movie in all respects, I loved drawing cartoon films, old story and dialogue, download film"
550,"Amazing, unique animations and a very interesting story. Only one negative thing, wish there was more of it!"
551,"""A true selfless act always sparks another.""If your kid has ever asked you where did Santa Claus come from or why is he the way he is, then this is the movie you ought to watch together. More than a month before Christmas last year (2019), Netflix released a Christmas movie that pulled everyone's hearts out. This movie was titled Klaus. Based on the myth of the Santa Claus (or is it a myth, really?), Sergio Pablo's Klaus is about how a friendship between an old man and a good-for-nothing postman results into the legend that is now renowned as of the Santa Claus.Think of it like an origin story of the entire legend of Santa Claus. All of the myths regarding Santa Claus, say of the Naughty List or the one of where he watches everything or every other that you can think of, for that matter. It's not like Klaus has magical reindeer with him or that he fits into the chimney, but when you see the movie, you realize how the creators have explained all of that.When Jesper, a student at the Royal Postal Academy, distinguishes himself as the worst student of the academy, he is stationed to set a postal office in Smeerensburg, a frozen island far into the North, with the ultimatum to get 6000 letters stamped by him else he would lose all of his inheritance. The thing about Smeerensburg that everyone fails to mention to him, however, is that it is the place of one of the longest and oldest feuds in the history of feuds-between the Krums and the Ellingboes. All they ever do is destroy the other person so there isn't much need for a letter. How then, will Jesper station his office? This is where Klaus comes in.A movie popularly recognized to stand amongst the often-watched Christmas classics, Klaus also merits to be one of the best Netflix films for children and adults, alike. People from every which age can watch it and fall in love with it. The best part, however, about the movie is that it is beautiful to watch. Once you sit down, you don't even want to get up to bring popcorn!It is no unknown fact that the movie has some very violent scenes, what with it being based on one of the oldest feuds known to man. Yet, not only do those scenes end quickly, but they are also portrayed in such a comical manner that it wouldn't be much of an issue to show to the kids.What I also liked about the film was its central message: how an unselfish deed can go a long way. It isn't about giving and sharing, or how they are better. All it says is that if you do one thing for the goodwill of the people then other good things will follow. (Hint: Jesper's happiness at seeing Margu with the boat.) Some other things the movie talks about include the importance of education and of a proper community in the lives of the people. It also shows us why age-old grudges that hold no substance except their identity as a grudge better stay buried. That is why the transformation of the place was a huge thing, especially since it was based on simple steps that the kids took.What adds more tangibility to the movie is Klaus's backstory. You find out a lot more about Klaus and why he does the things he do, adding more depth to the character. Not to mention how Klaus is huge but there aren't many fat jokes. Of course, it is mentioned and you also laugh at the way it is mentioned but you also deal with it. It's there; you can't do much about it.Among the characters, I found Mrs. Krum to be the most spectacular character. She is evil but in her own way, she is also pretty funny. When you mix evil and comedy together, the outcome isn't always that great. Mrs. Krum proves to be one of those exceptions that actually do make it great. Mrs. Krum's son and Mr. Ellingboe's daughter are also pretty amazing. You'll have to watch the movie to find out why, but let me just say this here that these four people (Mrs. Krum, her son, Mr. Ellingboe, his daughter) probably make one of the best antagonist groups in the history of antagonist groups! Not only is their characterization amazing but their animation, too!Of course, Jesper was another favourite. Yes, he is a cliche (not that the entire movie isn't filled with it) but his transformation from one of the most self-centered people to the guy who spends his time making a boat, is worth-mentioning. Klaus was another great character. I enjoyed his story. I fell in love with him. Their relationship together is something that shows what true friendship really is.Miss Alva, a person desperate to leave Smeerensburg but who then ends up staying there for good-yeah, another character who I absolutely adored. Margu, the little Saami girl's importance in the movie doesn't go unnoticed. Had it not been for her, we might never have had a Mr. Claus. I also love how the movie consulted Saamis in its making."
552,"What a beautiful movie! So well written and executed, it touched every emotion within me, from fear to sadness to joy to anger and everything in-between, a true ""emotional roller-coaster"". Simply put, a pure joy to watch."
553,"Initially, I had no awareness of this movie, and didn't have particularly high expectations.At first, I was unsure if I was watching the right film. Nothing about the Tim Burton-esque beginning resonated as a Christmas story.
However, this movie ended up being incredible.Equal parts hilarious and touching, the animation is unique and expertly crafted. The closing lines of the movie are an incredibly touching conclusion.Highly recommend."
554,"It s my first time when i vote and write a review for something like that. I m 23, not a old age but this movie make me feel like a child. This movie remembered me of the mornings in which i woke up and i run to the christmas tree to see the present. I feel joy, pleasure, love and the innocence of the childhood. And the end, it s perfect match for a child. Remember to stay kind and good and the santa will come in the night of 24's december. And by the way, dont forget, child and adults ""A true act of good will always sparks another""!"
555,A found so many answers at questions from my childhood. I cried and I laught. Love this movie!
556,"When Jesper distinguishes himself as the Postal Academy's worst student, he is sent to Smeerensburg, a small village located on a icy island above the Arctic Circle, where grumpy inhabitants barely exchange words, let alone letters. Jesper is about to give up and abandon his duty as a postman when he meets local teacher Alva and Klaus, a mysterious carpenter who lives alone in a cabin full of handmade toys."
557,"Loved it so much
An inspiring picture about a spoiled young man who change to a better one when he is sent to work as a post man in a remote area"
558,"The strength of any animated movie is 1) animation and 2) voice acting. Brilliant voice acting can help elevate a film even if the animation isn't amazing. But Klaus is a winner on both points. The right mix of comedy and heartwarming moments, it's a lovely take on the myth of Santa Claus. It reminded me of Emperor's New Groove, a spoiled selfish man finding himself through a selfless act. You hate Jasper the postman at the start but within 15 minutes you're rooting for him. The feuding families are hilarious, and how one man causes such a drastic change in the town of Smeerensberg is just inspiring. I particularly loved how they showed the passage of time and by the end I was so invested in the story and the characters, the last 5 minutes were just trying to watch the movie through all the tears. Klaus will warm up your heart and make you believe in the spirit of Christmas again. So glad Netflix gave this beautiful movie a home; it deserves to be watched and loved by all!"
559,Simply amazing. Netflix has really outdone themselves with this one!
560,"I absolutely love this movie, It's lovely to look at, is backed up with a great music score and contains actors with wonderful voices that really being the characters to life. The story is original, gives us lots of humour and is genuinely moving. We love it. Netflix give us more!"
561,"I went kind of speechless after watching the movie, other than thinking...I'll watch it with my daughter someday when she is old enough to understand it. No Disney movies have ever made me want to do that. The movies that ever came close to good or decent are the toy story movies, and / or perhaps Up. It's not just the plot, the animation, character design, style, music, it's the execution of all of them combined.I rarely give a review on any movies because I work in the film industry, there is always something I don't like about a movie, plot holes, acting issues, creative designs, just always something. However, I am not a particularly picky movie viewer. I tried not to criticise most movies, simply because I know how much time and effort the crew puts into making one. It's no easy task, but there will always be something that fell flat.I write reviews not based on how much I like / dislike the movies, rather what I learned from them and how much I appreciate them.What I learned from Klaus as a movie maker:
we don't need crazy CGI, A-list actors/actresses, 3D animations to make a great movie.we don't need catchy song along songs, those we hear so often until we are absolutely sick of themwe don't need the same stories nor movies to be remake five thousand different times, that's lazy, and of course, fast cashwe don't need superheroes, nor super villainwe don't need a complicated story, rather a creative oneHow can we re-write a story of a holiday tradition that is so influential in our life time? Klaus is not only creative, it's original! Klaus didn't tell us anything new about human nature, but the story puts children front and centre. It reminds us that children don't discriminate, if they do, it is the result of parenting and the pressure of our society. It shows us how simple acts of kindness could (potentially) change our world. The screenplay is timeless and very well written. There are no catchy songs, nor sing along, only music scores that move our emotions along with the movie. The classic 2D hand drawn style brought us back to the times when sending and receiving letters was one of the few things we actually look forward to.I didn't learn anything new from Klaus. It did however, reminded me of what gives us joy. It could be as simple as a random act of kindness, writing a letter to an old friend, or spend valuable time with my love ones, in a small town, without silk sheets, a butler, and all the material stuff that we don't need."
562,"I loved this story. I thought it was fun, inspiring, and very touching. The friendship formed between the spoiled son and Klaus was the best. And how they changed the children's behavior by showing them they mattered was brilliant. I enjoyed this movie more than my favorites I watch every year."
563,Part of me wishes I watched this on Christmas. I watched it on New Years and it still had the same effect. Within five minutes I knew the movie was going to be amazing. It goes on to tell the origins of Santa Claus and the linkage to Christmas and everything in between.This is hands down my favorite Christmas movie. I had a dumb smile on my face for a good portion of the movie. The only con is that I wish it was longer and more detailed!
564,"This movie was low in my priority to watch, but after reading some good reviews about it, I decided to give it try. And it turned out to be one of those few surprises which you didn't expect a lot but turned out to be really, really, really good.The first part of the movie was carried by the very witty and funny dialogue. But then the story starts to unfold, and it is a familiar one I've heard before many times, but told in a slightly different manner and still turned out to be engaging to watch.Anyway, a truly remarkable movie, funny and touching to watch at the same time. I encourage everyone to watch it, truly outstanding. A hidden Gem on Netflix."
565,"I felt xmas again.. lovely, warm, unexpected. Just brilliant."
566,Visually beautiful and a storyline to match. A must watch.
567,"Such a happy and unique story of klaus.
Fun to watch with the whole family, beautiful animation and definitely a favorite xmas movie"
568,Absolutely beautiful animation. Superb music score. Wonderfully voice acted. Perfect. Thank you.
569,"I liked Klaus so much, and yet I am not the person that likes such type of movies regularly. It's the story of Santa that we all know but the writer have given it more aspects and spirit. I loved everything about the movie that's why it's a 10/10.
Good job lads."
570,"Looking forward to see this animated master piece become a Christmas classic in the upcoming years. The whole visual style of the film is beautifully presented in a very unique, family friendly animattion. Honestly the best Christmas cartoon to date with it's wholesome story and charming score."
571,I will add this to my Christmas tradition list this is such an amazing story and wonderful animation as well!!! A double whammy!! Usually all of the Christmas movies have overused tropes and skip the semi-dark tones (not too dark for the kids! just tell them it was magic!) but this one hit all the great spots on my list!! It took me 30 minutes to stop crying!
572,I was surprised that the Writers found a way to show another persepektive. I really enjoyed it.
573,"This was such a charming and believable movie. Very funny, GREAT message and not a typical or predictable ending.. So much LOVE! So much truth.
Fun acting good animation."
574,"This movie is everything a children's movie should be, and at the same time does not alienate the older audience. I'm giving it a 10/10 so that the overall score gets bumped up ever so slightly. I would give it a 9/10 otherwise."
575,"Original story, breath taking scenes and with humour thrown in. I've been telling everyone I know to watch this film."
576,"So beuatiful, so warm... Great story! I enjoyed every minute of the movie."
577,"A movie that delves into the myth of Santa Claus with such an original and endearing storytelling that will warm your hearts and bring tears of happiness.
Klaus is one of the best Christmas movie til It's a wonderful life"
578,"With all the Christmas films coming out in 2019, Klaus has got to be one of my favourites.When Jesper's father sends him to the middle of no where to work as a postman, he is given a mission to post a large amount of letters within one year before returning home. With hope to get it over and done with quickly, Jesper discovers there's a divide amongst the village where fights a regularly taken place.When Jesper meets Klaus, he is pushed into delivery a small toy to a child and see something that isn't common around the village... laughter and smiles. Seeing the happiness in the small child, Jesper tells the children of the village that they must write a letter to Klaus to receive a toy in return.I'm sure you can start to see what path the film goes down..Klaus was so enjoyable to watch. It takes a different approach to Christmas films compared to a lot of them. It was refreshing and remained interesting from start to finish.I feel like this can easily become a classic that is rewatched every year, it was an incredible story"
579,"Such a beautiful piece of art. And the love for animation and tradition is overloading the screen and I can almost taste the creativity. Please make more. Its beautiful and very emotional, but in the right way! Thank you!"
580,A beautiful warm story to watch on a christmas morning with coocies and milk as breakfast.
581,"Having watched this movie twice now, once alone and with family after, this film is a gift upon this animation industry. I haven't cried after watching an animated movie for so long. This film deserves every praise it gets. Seriously."
582,"The movie's plot show us a different story of the Christmas' magic, show us changes through the love and the good deeds. There're some funny situations and the graphic work is impeccable and excellent. Definitely, one of the most beautiful Christmas movies I've seen."
583,"The beginning looked like it was going to be another dumb cartoon movie, with adult inside jokes weaved into a child's movie and dumb one- liners...but I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to be a great story. Haven't cried at a movie, no less a cartoon movie, in awhile....great job Netflix!"
584,"I was struggling to find a movie to get me in the Xmas spirit and stumbled across this one, about a postman?! May I say it's now one of our favourites, kids and adults alike will enjoy this film. I'm now sat here reviewing it whilst watching it for the 5th time in a week. The film brings the magic of Xmas in a different way and never touches on being cheesy. Funny and sad in a way only the best films can be. Just sit back, pop this film and enjoy."
585,This movie was cute and funny. My kids enjoyed watching it. Just in time for Christmas. But I felt it was another version of Emperor's New Groove... only no llama. Lol. You should still watch it though. ;)
586,What a wonderful Christmas movie. A true meaning of change of heart and friendship and love
587,"You can feel this is a passion project for the people who made this. This Netflix Original can definitely be compared to some of the best and most loved Disney theatrical releases when it comes down to the craftsmanship, attention to detail and pure heart and soul that went into making this funny, original and touching animation. An easy recommendation to watch with your kids and loved ones during the holiday season. Enjoy!"
588,I am a fan of Classic Animated Christmas Movie. This one was the best I've watched in years!
589,"Apparently this very pleasant and very warm appropriate X-Mas holiday story was almost not made. Unless ""Pixar or DreamWorks"" is the animation company this story and others like it can't get funded. *(Ebert)
This is a warm slightly different spin on a story told many times and is welcome to be told every year at this time.
Watch it and enjoy it as I did several times! The characters and story will leave anyone with a heart and hope for this world rebounding back to the magical memories of my youth. That this world belongs to everyone and everything. Love and fulfillment for all. May I be as bold to say,"" this is a warm Christmas card for all from Netflix!""
Thanks. üéÑ"
590,This is an instant classic! Instantly legendary Christmas movie! Epic!
591,"One of the best Chrismas movies ever!The script is just amazing!, The animation is amazing!!This movie is trully amazing!"
592,"There is so much to admire in this delightful film, but the main thing is that the story is utterly charming and works on every level. The pace is fantastic. The animation is unusual but works brilliantly, and some of the big scenic set pieces look so beautiful. Yes, there is a feeling of Tim Burton about the film but with bucketfuls more charm. Where Corpse Bride or Nightmare Before Christmas are quirky but ultimately grotesque, Klaus is quirky but ultimately warming. The words ""classic"", and especially ""instant classic"" are grossly over used these days, but I doubt many would challenge such a description for Klaus."
593,"Wasn't expecting much, but my daughter 7yrs insisted she wanted to watch this film.
Wow !!!! One if the best Christmas films I've seen."
594,"I wasn't expecting much when I first saw this listed on Netflix - but my goodness my feelings changed as soon as I had started watching it! One of the best Christmas movies I have seen! Initially the animation style I found simplistic and reminded me of Gorillaz a little, however it grew on me and it just added to this beautiful story! A very clever movie through and through! Filled with humour and very poignant moments - so make sure you set some time aside and watch it!"
595,What a brilliantly written Christmas tale. Beautifully illustrated and magical to watch. Such an enjoyable movie with lovable characters and a wonderful message of kindness.
596,"I just finished klaus, it's 7am. My daughter was up early so I thought why not? Beats another rerun of paw patrol.
I'm now wiping tears from my eyes in sheer disbelief at how beautiful that film was.It kept a 2 Year old happy the whole time and it's made this Christmas more magical than ever before. I think santa Claus will now forever be klaus in my heart. I look forward to you coming down my chimney this year!Thank you to everyone involved in the production of a masterpiece. These tears are for you all!"
597,"I was skeptical going into this movie with all the 10 star reviews but wow! This is an amazing movie. The characters are well written, the story will make you cry, and the animation is beautiful. I'm speechless and am hoping this movie stays on the Top 250 list."
598,Amazing screenplay. Heartwarming movie. This has to become a classic. One of the best (if not the best) Netflix original movies I've seen.
599,Fantastic story which remains entertaining from start to end. The animation is incredible and the textures and styling used throughout are incredible. The lighting alone is just amazing.The Christmas element of the film is beautifully told and the layers are added well throughout the story.An instant classic!
600,"Fantastic film! I love the idea of the origins of Santa Claus. Great idea, fantastically written and a joy to watch. Definitely will be watching this every year for Christmas!"
601,"Jesper is a spoiled son of the Post Master General, he only cares about himself and living a comfortable life. His father to teach him a lesson in humility and the value of hard work sends him to the town of Smeerensburg. In this town abides two rival families that have been in conflict since before anyone can remember. they don't know why, they just know that they don't like each other. Jesper has been given the task that if he can deliver a certain amount of letters he will be able to return home. The problem is that because everyone disdains one another, no one will ever send a letter. All of that changes when though a series of events Jesper helps a woodsman named Klaus give a toy to a little boy. Jesper uses this opportunity to manipulate the children into sending letters to Klaus so that he will send them a toy. Through this experience Jesper learns that ""An act of good will inevitably sparks another"". A great message but unfortunately not executed perfectly. You see because Jesper tells the children that if they aren't good that they won't get any toys, the kids begin doing good deeds around town and the town starts because a better and more friendly place to live. The elders of both families don't like this and plot to get rid of Jesper and spot Klaus from giving any more toy. They conclude that if they stop the toys from coming people will cease doing acts of good will. While the film has a happy ending it never really disproves this theory. As Jesper says ""Everyone is out to get something"" he even uses the kids being good for toys as an example. While Jesper does become less selfish by the end of the film this objection is never really answered. Even Klaus and Jesper it could be argued have something to get out of the good tht they do, though it may be subjective. So is there anyone who has done an act of good will by pure motive. there is only one, Jesus Christ. Who left the glory of heaven, humbled himself to become a man and walk among us. Dies on the cross bearing our sins and being punished under the wrath of God that we as sinners deserve. On the 3rd day He rose again and he has done this to redeem a people who don't deserve it. He is the good will to men. Klaus is a wonderful film with great animation that I plan to watch every year as a Christmas tradition but it points me back to the true good will that came to men 2,000 years ago. Also made my wife cry, a delightful film."

620,"It has been many years since i saw a christmas movie that made me feel good inside, you know the way that Christmas movies did when you were a child, well that Feeling just hit me like a ton of bricks while watching Klaus with my son. Klaus is a visuel pleasure to watch and the storytelling is at it's Best. Klaus tells us what a selfless act can do, and how it can spark a fire of kindness and love in others. The movie is Funny, warm , and downright what christmas is all about."
621,Me like dis movie./Fortnite bad Minecraft good you frickins 9 year olds frikin stupid
622,"I absolutely love it - convenient, but not over complicated story with just enough dimentiality of the characters embodied in incredible and astonishing visual style - what the heck else do you want from any movie, especially a Christmas one?
With that level of competence of the production in literally every way it's just bizarre to me how such masterpiece couldn't find it's home for so long.
I'm definitely looking for more movies like this in the future."
