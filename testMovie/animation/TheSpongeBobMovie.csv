0,"Stephen Hillenburg was heavily against a spinoff of any kind. This movie is just an introduction to the spinoff that will be called 'Camp Coral'. While it's not prevelant at first, during the closing scenes it shifts from an animation movie to an ad. Most of the cast will be given a short clip of how they 'met' spongebob through a flashback to the soon to be made spinoff, even though there are entire episodes dedicated on how spongebob meets certain cast members. Continuity has never been a strong suit to the show but downright ignoring all character history is a disgrace.The movie has some moments that you can enjoy. With my mind on the whole 'camp coral' it did make me laugh less than the average watcher. There isn't enough scenes that are downright funny. And lastly this didn't feel like an actual spongebob movie. This comes closer to a movie like Trolls than Spongebob with how many celebrities they actively show, the songs they sing and the story they tell.
They chose popculture over entertainment."
1,"It was funny and now and then interesting, but then it started to become a big long commercial for the new spinoff.
Keanu Reeves was great, but they did almost nothing with him, it felt like his role and the wild West were forced into the Story to give him screen time.
The Movie was okay but nothing special."
2,"Funnily enough, things don't start off too bad. We get introduced to the main gang: Spongebob, Patrick, Mr Krabs, Sandy, Squidward and Plankton engaging in their typical everyday routine, and there are a few grin-worthy moments. The new CGI animation takes some getting used to, but overall it isn't a huge problem.The downward spiral begins when Sandy invents a new robot, which acts as the plot point for a turn of events as Gary, Spongebob's pet snail, gets mollusc-napped. This unfunny bucket of bolts constantly talks nonsense, punctuated by random utterances of 'You're Fired'. Whether this is meant to be a spoof of soon-to-be-ex president Donald Trump in his Apprentice days who can say, but the perpetually unamusing antics of this creation provide a low bar for what is to follow.Spongebob and Patrick go off to rescue their snail friend, and there is a completely pointless diversion into an old western set with a cameo from Snoop Dogg and an extended role from Keanu Reeves as a rolling ball of hay. Apparently, he's meant to be some sort of 'sage', but his lame platitudes and attempts at wit provide no break from the non-stop idiocy that surrounds him. How they managed to get him in this film I don't know: maybe his kid was a huge fan of the cartoon and they blackmailed him with that. The things we do for our children...Oh yes, back to the 'story', as it is. Apparently sending Spongebob off to rescue Gary was another of Plankton's hare-brained schemes, so he could steal the secret formula. After seeing how broken-up Mr Krabs is at the loss of his best fry cook though, the small villain decides to GASP grow a conscience and 'fess up. So now the rest of Spongebob's buddies are on a mission to rescue the yellow one, who's got himself captured by a vain sea king. The old king is the one who wanted Gary you see, on account of the snail's slime having age-rejuvenating properties, and... yes, I felt a tiny bit stupider just typing that out.Not half as stupid though, as the random flashbacks we get of Spongebob meeting and helping the rest of his pals in 'Kamp Krusty', destined to be a future spin-off of the series very soon. That's right... the film's only reason for existing (apart from maybe as a novel torture device) is to introduce us to this crappy cash-in, along with the other two that are planned: one with Patrick, and one with Squidward. Yikes. That's a lot of terrible cartoons to avoid. How will I cope?!The fact they had to wait until after the creator died to make these is disgusting enough, but then we get to the WORST part of the film by far. Yes, while these sappy flashbacks are unveiling, we get each citizen of Bikini Bottom weeping to an attentive crowd about how much they LOVE Spongebob and how they can't live without him. Yes, even Squidward and Mr Krabs. Now, I don't mind the occasional mild hint in the show that these two characters care about him, but oh no... this movie goes FULL ON about how much they adore him despite all their previous actions and statements to the contrary. GAG. Some of the recent seasons have been accused of being too mean... this completely flips the switch and becomes a sugary-sweet ordeal which'll have you reaching for the sick bucket before it's all over.Then we get an equally saccharine music number I had to mute before it was over, followed by yet ANOTHER moral about 'it doesn't matter what you look like, it's what's inside that counts'. (Gee, how many million times have we heard THAT old chestnut) before a cheesy ending that oddly enough, rips off the conclusion of the We Bare Bears TV movie. That WBB film officially wrapped up that particular show... if only the same could be said for this utter travesty.Where has the hilarious and smart cartoon of my youth gone? Squeezed of all it's life that's what, over too many seasons for nothing but financial reasons. And with three more uninspired pieces of trash on the horizon to further tarnish its legacy, it looks like the flogging of the dead seahorse will continue for quite a while.Well, you can count me out. I'll stick to the first few seasons and the previous two movies, all of which were MUCH better than this. And they weren't trying to sell us a pup on the side, either. Sponge On The Run? Run away from it. As fast as you can. Trust me on this. 3/10"
3,"Well, I did have certain expectations for this one hence the previous sequels. And, sadly, I was right. This is a SpongeBob movie that should've deserved a good plot accompanying the nice animation, but it's just a long, long disappointment.Recycled jokes, check. Too slow reactions, check. Pointless side quests, check. Pointless cameos, check. Pointless hit music, check. Forcing the story forward without a smooth transition, check. Dragging ending with a weird unfolding, check.Did not pay money for this, otherwise would want a refund."
4,"Shame. There is no plot, no story, no content. A disrespect on the creators name, where in the end they say ""In memory of Stephen Hillenburg"" as if trying to curse.The first 10 minutes are actually enjoyable but after that... I wish I had quit at that moment but just hoped that it would get back on track."
5,"The sponge on the run movie has greatly disappointed me. I have loved spongebob since I was a infant and absolutely loved the first movie when I was 4, and I feel heartbroken for why this movie is bad. First and foremost they disrespected the death of Stephan hillanburg even with the end card, hillanburdg said he never wanted a spin-off and during on the run there was a pilot for the new camp koral and it has no continuity. In the first 3 seasons spongebob meets sandy at her house while in this movie spongebob finds her when there were kids. Most of the movie has very bad pacing and bored me to death. The animation is good but with them making a new story with a beloved character like spoungebob it makes me really sad. Tbh I would rather watch the emoji movie or all 3 Fred films or annoying orange then watch sponge on the run."
6,"This just doesn't have the same humour and wit it used to. The characters are there but they seem to be 2d versions and don't heat the same beats they used too.
My kids liked it but it just felt slightly off the whole way through for me. The flashbacks were weird too"
7,"The movie was bad. An absolute monstrosity of a movie. I cannot believe they went with this. I absolutely hate this. This movie should just burn in the pits of hell.The plot was bad
The jokes were bad
The movie was an add for the stupid spin-off that goes against Stephen Hillenburg's wish for NO spin-offs and all the actual episodes of the spongebob that we love.IM JUST ANGRY.
THE END"
8,"A truly aweful movie that continues to butcher Spongebob's character, stripping him of his depth and relatability and just making him an annoying sponge whos trying too hard. Not only was the story complete nonsense but it disrespects the very lore of Spongebob. King Posiden? What happened to King Neptune? Remember that classic episode where Spongebob meets Sandy Cheeks? Never happened, he met her at Camp Koral.... Seriously, all these other reviewers must have some serious brain damage, the movie is pure tarter sauce and to say its well written is a complete joke. thinks happen for no reason, all tension is thrown away, things resolve instantly, right near the beggining Spongebob and Patrick have an out of character fight for no reason and instantly make up, they get some coin from Keanu Reaves and nothing even happens with it. They get told not to get distracted in Atlantis, they do but right after they are at the gates of the palace they went there for so it doesnt even matter that they were distracted. Honestly, if you ever had love for Spongebob and recognized what it actually was that made it unique and fun don't be like me and think maybe this movie will right its wrongs from after the first movie. It doesn't, it is truly, truly, truly, 10000% terrible and actually genuinly disrespectful in so many ways to the very creator of Spongebob."
9,"As a fan of the original cartoon series (Hillenburg era 1999-2004) and first 2 theatrical films, The third SpongeBob film ""Sponge on the Run"" is what I like to call the perfect storm of soulless cynical cash-grab. it feels almost nothing like a proper SpongeBob movie, more like an very expensive ""TV Special"" then a Theatrical film, not to mention a shameless tie-in to the SpongeBob spin-off series ""Camp Corral"" (which already manages to retcon the series and mess-up the back stories of the main characters) and oh boy they are pushing this spin-off very hard at the expense of the film. the main ""so-called"" plot is another rehash of ""Gary is Missing"" episode and the film does a really poor job retelling this story.it's about SpongeBob and Patrick are on a road trip to find Gary in Lost City of Atlantic City. the film feels like an executive producer's wet-dream, cause it reeks of being too safe, predictable and by the numbers like with many sadly, children films these days. with pointless celebrity cameos that add almost nothing to movie but stating the obvious, modern ""hit"" music that stinks of quantity, main characters not acting like their characters, few jokes made me chuckle, but most are stale and lame even by SpongeBob standards.unlike the previous films, I had a very hard time watching this film. this is definitely the weakest film in the film series by far. Viacom (who own's nickelodeon) completely went against the late Stephen Hillenburg's whishes and vision and essentially throwing his SpongeBob he created completely out the window. like many fans predicted it's completely 100% ""a shadow of it's former-self"" which is sad.the only positives I can give this film it's a great time-waster for children, like i mention before few jokes were little bit funny and the CGI stop-motion style animation while very different from the previous films and show works surprisingly well and looks great.I'm happy this film's didn't get a worldwide theatrical release cause it doesn't feel like a film and fits perfectly with the mediocrity of streaming service films (80% of the time) ."
10,"I'm a huge fan of 'SpongeBob SquarePants (1999-)'; I absolutely love the first three seasons of the show and the first movie. That's why it's so hard for me to say that 'The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge On The Run (2020)', well, sucks. The movie has maybe one proper laugh in it, with only a few half-chuckles along the way, and its plot feels like a rehash of past narratives that's padded with unnecessary scenes - such as an absolutely pointless, painfully extended stint in live-action land that seems to only have been included so that the director could smoke weed with Snoop Dogg - and often stops dead in its tracks to cram in some continuity-crunching advertisements for the upcoming 'Kamp Koral' spin-off show. It's a huge disappointment, to say the least. Even an extended Keanu Reeves cameo can't elevate the affair - though his appearances are certainly some of the flick's highlights. There are some visually distinct sequences (its 3D animation is generally well-achieved) and, as I mentioned, a few half-chuckles here and there, but the feature just isn't all that enjoyable overall. It also lacks any real messaging or narrative satisfaction. Ultimately, it's a shadow of its former self. The difference in quality between this and the first flick is almost inconceivable. 4/10"
11,"The second Spongebob movie was not that good and this movie is even worse.Bad story, filler and promotion for the new series Kamp Koral.I don't like the animation and the soundtrack is solid at best.There were plotholes like the origin of Sandy. She met Spongebob first as a grown up and not in Kamp Koral.The guest stars Keanu Reeves, Danny Trejo and Snoop Dogg did a solid job.All in all a disappointing third movie and definitely not a must-see."
12,"I loved this movie, but it isn't for everyone. It's got a nonsensical plot and the humour is so random that not everyone is going to like it. It seems to be made more so for people who watched the series when they were kids and are now grown up than for kids now, many of the jokes didn't have much that a kid could grasp on to compared to the series and original movie (I haven't seen the second movie as of writing this review).That said I had so much fun watching it, probably the most joyous time I've spent watching something this year, and fun is really what watching a Spongebob movie is all about."
13,"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run was a disappointment. That might seem like a strange thing for a 24-year-old to say, but I got quite a bit of enjoyment from the first two films. They were definitely made for children, but in a way that was also entertaining for adults.Sponge on the Run was solely for children, and the animation even felt a lot more childish than the first two films. There was slapstick humour, cringy dialogue, and a formulaic plot, none of which worked for me.That being said, I was never bored and I liked the overall bones of the narrative, even if they didn't completely knock it out of the park with the execution. There was also a certain charm to it, especially when seeing flashbacks to a younger SpongeBob and his first meeting with some of the characters.There have been live-action elements in all three SpongeBob films, but I would put this one on par with the original. The live-action aspects weren't bad, but they didn't add much to the overall narrative, unlike the way they were incorporated in Sponge Out of Water.The villain's plot was boring and uninteresting. The best part of the film was Keanu Reeves, but he was over-used at a certain point.The writing was mediocre, and the humour was hit-or-miss. There were some funny moments, but nowhere near as many as in the first two films and the jokes fell flat as many times as they landed.The film went from having heartfelt moments to breaking out in terrible musical pieces and that mixture in tone didn't land the way they probably intended.With all of that being said, the second half of the film is considerably better than the first. The film gets more focused, more fun, more heartfelt, and the character dynamics were a lot more interesting.Overall, The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run was a mixed bag. It's the weakest SpongeBob film, but I still had some fun with it and I was charmed by the characters. There will be enough to entertain children, but it's far more focused on that than the first two films were and that was a disappointment for me.SCORE: 54%"
14,"First of all Stephen Hillenburg was heavily against a spin-off of any kind, the existence of this movie is a sheer insult to his dying wish for there not to be any spin-offs ever. Second, in terms of story, this not only destroys but negates all love and history Hillenburg poured into the show while he still had control. The best thing about this movie being Keanu Reaves and his lines, if he wasn't here I'd find a way to rate it 0 stars. The villain has no good motive or drive and the end of the conflict arrives in the most random unenterprising way possible. I struggling to continue writing this review because with every lasting moment I think about this horror I lose more brain cells. All ideas for spin-offs were created after Hillenburg just so they could get away with this mockery. I pray to God the TV show ""Kamp Koral"" and ""The Patrick Star Show"" is cancelled and that the high-ups realize their mistake. It's not a surprise why animators started leaving the Spongebob team, anyone who's worked for Hillenburg would know this is wrong in every way. If Hilenburg were to see this I guarantee he would have ended his show knowing this was going to exist. The ""In Memory of Stephen Hilenburg at the end was the biggest flip off I've ever witnessed in the movie industry. Yes this is a rant, yes I made an account for this website just to spite this movie (and I shall for a few more websites), yes I'd rather live the rest of my life not having watch this. If I had the world to fill in the rest of the available space on this review about how must I despise it I would but I made the mistake of watching this at 2 AM, on top of my mistake of watching it to begin with, and cannot contain my anger. If have an account of this website please leave a dislike, 1 star, and rage emoticon D:< .Afraid of the truth? Nickelodeon is.
If you leave a comment I promise I wont answer, if I do expect strong sarcasm."
15,"I was really excited for this film and it's new animation style, but my god that's the worst story eveeeeer that is only full of nonsense literally. There were lots of scenes only to fill the gap between the beginning and ending and it was really really bad. It's very childish and the animation along with the story might be more appropriate for a video game and I even doubt it would be good. And Keanu for god's sake don't make me hate John Wick. The worst most unfunny role eveer. 1/10."
16,"I'll always expect a good spongebob movie because of the first movie's quality, and this certainly doesn't correspond to my expactations. Plankton trying to rob the secret formula again as the main enemy is such an old story and for me he doesnt fit in this role anymore. Gary has an excential role in the movie but even so the character doesnt gain any new layer or complexity (except for the summer camp story that they tried to force all of the characters into it and contradicts some classical episodes of the series - making me think that its a movie that try to renew spongebob for the newest generation like they are trying to do with pokemon for example, ignoring some excential parts of the show. I dont have problem with it, only when made poorly). The movie bets on special participations and its a classical move of spongebob's films, but I particularly never liked it so much, specially for being the non-american part of the public. I totally liked the animation style and I think that was the great shot of the production. Congrats to the animation team! Hope Spongebob keeps launching new movies, but movies above the average like they did with the first. (And I'm not being an saudosist, watched it recently and got me surprised again for how funny it was!)"
17,"Don't even let your kids watch this.
Sorry not even worth reviewing. Don't waste your time."
18,"Firstly, it overwrittes some events, for example how the characters met. It was shown in the TV-series how some of the characters met the first time, but acording to this it happened way before. It's just terrible writting, as if they forgotten what had happened. Secondly, it clearly advertises Kamp Koral. Thirdly,
many characters are out of character, they do stuff they would have never did in the TV-series. Forthly, the plot is so thin and bare bones simple, lacks any kind of adventure or creativity, just dreadfully uninspired. Fifthly, tons of celebrity cameos just for the sake of having celebrity cameos, it felt cheap and very out of place.
I'll admit that song choice was great, and animation was superb, but that's all it is worth. This is the worst of Spongebob so far, but I bet Kamp Koral will be even worse than this. After the death of the original Spongebob creator it keeps gettings worse and worse. They should really stop this show, because it already has hit the bottom of terrible quality."
19,"Avoid, not worth of watching. Plot is stupid, and you can't even watch it with kids. It use to be super funny tv series, but the movie is really bad."
20,Very simple plot but is a lot of fun with some fun cameos as well as many funny jokes. Didn't get boring at any times. I think that it was definitely better than the previous movie.
21,"Every character is shown to meet spongebob in flashback sequences that completely disregard the previous canon. They used this movie to set up a new show called Camp Coral, and it shows.The peak of the movie was snoop dogg and Danny trejo. Keanu Reeves and weezer are forced memes.The voice cast is clearly getting old. Some moments just don't sound like the original characters.The entire Keanu Reeves plot doesn't end up going anywhere. It seems like when spongebob wakes up from the dream, the entire movie had a shift in direction.Lastly, they dishonoured Stephen hillenburg by putting his name on something so subpar. I don't believe that he approves of these rewrites to his story and characters."
22,"Stephen Hillenburg would be thoroughly disappointed in this film.... it doesn't use the animation style that Stephen pioneered, it's filled with celebrities (which he didn't do), and it doesn't elicit a single laugh from the viewer.Really, how do they have the gall to say 'in the loving memory', of a man who created Spongebob to be actually funny, and to NOT be filled with celebrities or advertisements (skype, facetime, etc. are mentioned in the movie).So it's not funny at all (didn't laugh once in the whole movie), and it's frankly an insult to the creator's memory. 3/10 and that's only because of Keanu."
23,"If you asked me to name the show that I watched the most and talk about constantly when I was a kid, I would easily without hesitation, say it was Spongebob Squarepants.Created by Stephen Hillenberg, the Nickelodeon show, which hit the airwaves more than two decades ago at the turn of the century, chronicled the day to day undersea life of the titular sea sponge who worked at a fast-food joint and the antics he and his zany friends would get up to while being an unbelievable beacon of cheerfulness and optimism, much to the annoyance of some.It quickly caught on, easily becoming the network's most popular show, a cultural phenomenon that is recognizable everywhere, and with the show still airing new episodes, it continues to strike a chord with audiences of all ages, myself included, being countlessly referenced, marketed, and in particular, memed online. I dare you to go on a social media thread without seeing one Spongebob reference or image. My belief is that all these characters encompass what many of its core following, particularly the Millenials & Gen Z, went or are going through now, and encountering the struggles, wants, and desires that both a child and adult has and paints a reflection on the lifestyle this audience is experiencing first hand in today's modern society.Or I could just be crazy and it was just a colourful, silly distraction. Here's a link that explains my notion in greater detail.He also starred in a couple of movies, each spanning a different decade apart (2004's The Spongebob Squarepants Movie and 2015's Sponge Out of Water), that are both worth rewatching, which I did in preparation to revisit the world of Bikini Bottom, and I can definitely say stand up much better than the other adaptions of popular Nickelodeon mainstays like Rugrats or Avatar (spoiler and apologies to Last Airbender fans, but Spongebob is three for three right now), especially considering how they are some of the last mainstream traditionally-animated films to grace the big screen. But now with this third film, even he has transitioned over to the third-dimensioned common to the current landscape. Does this serve the story better and make it stand out more, or does it distract by cramming in too much of today's trends like the recent Scoob! or Trolls.Thankfully, it doesn't. This is Spongebob (Tom Kenny) as pure as he is and this time, his beloved pet snail Gary is Snailnapped! Taken by the evil Plankton (Mr. Lawrence), and given to the vain and self-absorbed King Posidon (Matt Berry), in an effort to get that Krabby Patty secret formula once and for all, the cheerful sponge and his dim-witted, but loyal best friend Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke), go on a quest to the Lost City of Atlantic City in an effort to get Gary back. Along the way, they come across a talking tumble-weed sage that looks a lot like a benevolent Keanu Reeves, an El Diablo figure with a Danny Trejo face, a Tiffany Haddish-personality fish, a robot with the voice of Awkwafina (this film stacks on the celebrity cameos), and a gorgeously lit Las-Vegas inspired city that puts Canto Bight to shame in looks alone, all while Spongebob's other friends, grouchy Squidward (Rodger Bumpass), frugal Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown), and scientific Sandy (Carolyn Lawrence), go out in search of him in order to rescue him from the dangers that lay ahead.From this premise, writer-director Tim Hill, who worked on the show in its early days, goes back to the buddy formula of the first movie, even having Patrick reference this early on and forgoing the weirdness/superhero/whatever sticks exploits of the last film, opting more for ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"" escapades and structure, where each situation of the adventure is different and more random from the last. That doesn't mean he disregards that film, as the teamwork aspect is brought back in the final act and having all the characters play a part and contributing to the plot, something the first film heavily lacked. Honestly, it's the best of both worlds, combining what worked in the previous two while not treading over the same old ground while taking influence from one of the show's more popular episodes ""Have You Seen This Snail?"", potentially making it my favourite of the three films so far.I think what also helps make me feel this way is because of the style of animation used. Those worried that the character's simple design would get lost in translation needn't worry, as this is a stunningly animated movie. It's saddening that Paramount decided to forgo a release in theatres in the U.S and opted for streaming, as it really deserves to be shown on a larger scale. The Rankin-Bass/Aardman like CGI are all finely detailed to make it resemble clay figures, right down to how the colours are placed and the speed the characters and background are going at, of course taking inspiration from the Phil Lord and Chris Miller school of design and placement, while still being in the realms of Spongebob. This will help Paramount Animation find it's footing should it continue to make itself like this, and hopefully find success. Not to bash how the other two looked (Sponge Out of Water did a great job rendering these characters in CGI for a live-action setting compared to the likes of those terrible Chipmunk and Smurfs movies), but that'll help it stand out more.This helps brings Sponge on the Run humour to life, as the film is chock full of blink and you'll miss it easter eggs, sight gags and wording older fans can appreciate and laugh at (also adding some risque jokes the series was known for), while having goofy expressions and voices the kids can enjoy and not be bored by, especially helped by the energy brought by the special guest stars. It also, believe it or not, tugs at the heartstrings a few times, in a couple well earned moments that feel believable, courtesy of the great voice talent who've played these roles since the beginning and have built great relationships and chemistry off and for each other, not like Scoob! which needed to replace the character's voices for the sake of celebrities and marketability (it also helps that they got Hans Zimmer to score this movie, making it more epic and impactful for). Even the sound effects, from Mr. Krabs' walk to the bubble transition to the next scene, sound just as they did twenty plus years ago and give the authentic experience older Spongebob fans who may no longer watch it can see again, this time with their own kids.By the time the credits roll and the last message pops up, you realize that Sponge on the Run was a celebration of who the character is and what Hillenberg, who unfortunately passed away in 2018, intended him to be from the beginning; an optimistic, positive, and considerate sponge who cares about his friends and the fish around him and will do whatever it takes to make them happy. Regardless of what you consider the quality of the show now and it's future to be (three spinoffs are planned, one of which was teased throughout this movie, though not as bad as you might think), or even your perspective on the character in the first place (it's understandable if you don't like him), it's nice to know that little Spongebob has given its creator a legacy with potentially the same staying power of Bugs Bunny and Mickey Mouse to keep more generations captivated with his nautical nonsense, and keep the kid inside me onboard still watching to this very day.To sum it up: Third time is definitely the charm for Spongebob, as Sponge on the Run is a silly, fun, and gorgeously animated celebration of the character who values friendships and positivity for anyone who was ever a fan"
24,"I grew up watching SpongeBob so for me it's almost uncomfortable critize it but honestly I got an headheck watching this movie.
Everything in the story is so noisy, flat and empty and the various unnecessary cameos are too random to be fully appreciated.
I liked the animation and the dubbing but that's it."
25,"Occasionally funny, trying at times to be heartwarming, this is an okay diversion that is well suited to kids. It's not trying to be hip, just silly and works at that."
26,"Bad story, bad jokes, actors and celebrities that randomly show up. This movie has been made just for the money, and not for being a good movie. Don't watch it."
27,"The movie is a disappointment. The plot is weak and steals the stories of the previous episodes and movies of the original show. Most of the time is spent advertising the new spinoff show, titled ""Kamp Koral"". There are a lot of plotholes that retcon most of the characters everyone liked in the original show to hop on the marketable baby trend. Nickelodeon disrespects the creator of the show, Stephen Hillenburg, who stated before his death that he never wanted ""Spongebob Babies"" to be produced. Decreases the value of Spongebob as a property."
28,"I saw the exclusive Canadian engagement of the film last weekend.
Overall, I think Spongebob fans and kids will enjoy this movie- probably not as much as the first movie but definitely as much as the second.The plot is pretty simple. It pretty much features the same plot as the previous two movies where Spongebob needs to save something that was stolen while Plankton tries to steal the secret formula while he's away.And just like the in other movies, Spongebob and Patrick's trip is where the fun is. Like the second movie, expect a lot of weirdness. Without giving too much away, expect musical numbers, zombies, and gambling.I also really enjoyed the celebrity cameos.
For those wondering, Keanu Reeves's role is more than just a cameo - he actually has a good amount of screen time in the film.
Danny Trejo also has a great role, but I won't spoil anything. I also liked Tiffany Haddish's appearance as Tiffany Haddock (get it).You'll also get to hear the character say some minor swear words. Spongebob says ""crappy"" twice"" while you'll hear Squidward say ""frickin"".The summer camp flashbacks I thought were nice. You can tell they were thrown in to build the Kamp Koral spin-off, but I didn't mind them.Just a nitpick though, according to the movie, Spongebob and Sandy already met before at summer camp, but longtime Spongebob fans will be quick to point out that Sandy and Spongebob actually meet for the first time in episode Tea the Treedome.Overall, Spongebob fans should enjoy this movie fine. It's an entertaining movie to watch if you want to turn off your brain for an hour and a half."
29,"What is wrong with film producers? I love the show Sponge Bob, so I am basically an easy customer here. Yet, it seems they cannot add live action and money to make Sponge Bob even better. Quite the opposite actually. Story is lame, poor character development, ending is pathetic, 3D animation is unremarkable. On top of that, they changed the back stories of how Sponge Bob met the other guys. High treason!"
30,"Yeah, not gonna lie. As a guy that enjoyed the previous two SpongeBob movie outings, I was not impressed with this one at all.The animation is great, truly bringing the world of SpongeBob fully into the world of CG and the voice acting is decent as usual from the cast but in typical bad CG kids movie fashion, good animation and voice acting can only go so far especially when just about everything else is trite.The story doesn't feel like it's taking SpongeBob to new territory, the villain was uninteresting and they soon start chucking flashback after flashback in your face to the point where it stops feeling a big movie adventure and more like a extended advert for that rubbish looking ""Kamp Koral"" spin-off nobody asked for.What a disappointment, this was."
31,"Bad and lazy writing, Bad story
The comedy and jokes not good like the other movies or the show."
32,Good. Pretty good. Some moments weren't good. Most were. The adventure? Good. Keanu Reeves? Good. Flashbacks? Not good. Overall I give this movie 7 goods out of 10. Too many flashbacks.
33,"Please do not waste your time, it's an awful movie"
34,"It's fair to say that I'm a fan of spongebob, at least I used to be. It's been a while since I watched it but there are some really memorable episodes that I consider to be great. It's really nostalgic for me and it has moments of genius as well. The Spongebob movie: Sponge on the run is not a moment of SpongeBob genius.There are some good moments but I'm going to forget it in a day or less.I thought the cinematography was good, it was a huge improvement from the television show from a technical standpoint. The animation was improved on heaps but I'm not really sure what they were going for. It's almost like the filmmakers wanted a more realistic look but they didn't fully commit. SpongeBob is at it's best when utilising animation to its fullest potential, so, again, I have no idea what they were thinking.There is quite a lot of social and political commentary in this movie, sadly it's all very heavy handed and annoying. A few times a character would straight up say how clichéd and uninteresting the movie is, exactly like deadpool did. Just because you know that your movie is clichéd and unoriginal doesn't make it less clichéd and boring. I didn't like it much in deadpool and I like it even less here. There are many more themes that are tackled, but they are all very on the nose as well.Despite being far worse than the show, there are still some great gags throughout, some of them really subtle which I respect a lot. I won't spoil the film, but my favourite gag comes early on during a scene where Plankton tries to negotiate with Mr. Krabs for the secret formula. I don't want to say what it is because it is really subtle but I found it hilarious.Music is kind of a big part about Sponge on the run. Some of the songs were good, like the song during the zombie dance scene. But I found two of them to be intolerable. The first song that plays and the end credits song.Finally one of my biggest issues is SpongeBob's character. This point actually applies for most characters, but SpongeBob is the biggest victim of this. He is a victim of lazy writing, he doesn't act like he does in any other SpongeBob property. If you are a huge fan of SpongeBob you won't understand half of the choices he makes in this film. Like I said I'm not even a huge fan and it still annoyed me a lot. I think his character is so bad that even if Spongebob didn't exist prior to this film, his action's still wouldn't make any sense to me and I'd think he's a really bad protagonist."
35,"The SpongeBob movie: Sponge on the Run starts with a punch that gives you a complete vibe of nostalgia. The film progresses through the first arc introducing the characters and current situation and so on. Throughout the film the presentation makes you laugh and feel bored at the same time. The screenplay creates an atmosphere that makes the movie feels like an episode of SpongeBob but doesn't add much to the table. The ending is kinda ok. In the end, the movie joins the so-called one time watch club."
36,"The Spongebob Movie Sponge On The Run is a 2020 Paramount Pictures animated sequel to the 2015 film which had Antonio Banderas in it. This time and Spongebob with his best friend Patrick Starr travel to the real world where they meet celebs such as Keanu Reeves and Snoop Dogg. The reason why they travel to our world is because Spongebob's snail Gary is missing.
Will he find him or not?
If you are a diehard fan of Spongebob then check it out."
37,"I could not even finish this one. This is not Spongebob. This is CGI rendered fecal matter. Spongebob is animated, not computer rendered. Also, this is nothing like the zany, madcap and sometimes risque Spongebob show & movies that we love. This is ""lowest common denominator"" pandering to a mindless audience. This is what happens when suits get hold of something nice and try to wring every last penny out of it. They destroy it."
38,"The character development is ok, and the history of the film isn't that bad, but still, this film shouldn't even exist, the creator of the series said that he doesn't wanted a spinoff of any kind, and this is honestly offensive to the memory of the creator."
39,It reminds me of my childhood. Even if the plot is a little thin
40,"2004, yes 16 years ago, a 16 year old's entire lifetime. That's how long ago Nickelodeon's aquatic yellow none vertebrae and his pink starry friend and his crew first graced the big screen. And it's not often that an animated TV series goes onto the big screen and gets huge success but with Spongebob Squarepants The Movie it did and with that success it gained not one but two sequels the middling Sponge Out of Water and this. Sponge On the Run features the same voice cast from Tom Kenny to Clancy Brown and features Danny Trejo and even Keanu Reeves as a wise Sage who leads our misfits on an adventure to the lost city of Atlantic City. And as much as the cast try and the writers try Sponge on the Run still lacks the charm of the 2004 original film, though the animated standards are pretty relying massively on 3D animation. But there's still that lack of charm, and although Sponge on the Run has some funny moments has some entertaining moments but sadly our favourite under-water creatures don't have the same fire. Which is a shame because Netflix have brought this out at the right time, but it also seems a bit too late too. Which sometimes isn't a bad thing. 3/5. Good but not great."
41,"I liked the overal movie, but I just wanted to say. WHY THE FLASHBACKS? I mean they were nice. But super random, and I think the only reason they put them in is to promote the kamp coral series it just pissed me off a little.The graphics were kinda nice but a little messy sometimes. The characters look good but obviously fake, but then the crabby patties look super realistic? It just felt weird to watch sometimes.The overall storyline was doable and I had a good watch."
42,"Stephen Hillberg would be smiling in heaven right now. Tim Hill, you are a good replacement because this is the best of 2020 we've seen.I went into the theater thinking that this movie was going to be a straight-up comedy. But I was wrong. Yes, most of the movie is comical, but there are some moments that can be emotional for some younger adults. In this movie, we get a taste of Spongebob's feelings towards Gary (he loves him so much). The backstory of how the characters met was probably the best part of the entire movie. All the stories is very bittersweet. Keanu Reeves, like always is very good. He actually has a pretty significant role in the movie. In the movie there are a lot of character cameos. Snoop Dogg and Danny Trejo also are in the movie and are very good despite having small roles.Both kids and adults would definitely enjoy the movie. I seriously do not understand people giving a negative rating about this movie. The least I can say is that this movie is better than Sponge out of the Water."
43,"This movie was So fun So enjoyable.
Really good. I Loved i give it 10"
44,"As a movie it's not very tightly plotted. However, it's as good as the best SpongeBob episodes. It's incredibly funny. It also has the funniest ending of all the SpongeBob episodes, and that's saying something. I miss the 2D animation but the CGI animation is gorgeous to look at.
The Kamp Koral flashbacks are an obvious pilot and give us a lot of plot holes, but they convey a beautiful message of friendship. Squidward's extremely tsundere-ish defense of SpongeBob was the best.
My problem with the previous two movies was that Sandy and Squidward, incidentally two of the smartest and wittiest characters on the show, were underused. Now they have more screentime than ever before and they have brilliant dialogue.I have a gripe with a casting choice in the German dub. What was the point of getting Moritz Schirdewahn, an obnoxious-looking YouTuber whose content seems to be lowbrow and heavily relies on merchandise sales in his content, to voice the young version of Squidward Tentacles, a boring, humorless octopus who looks down on anything childish? The voice Schirdewahn picked wasn't bad but nothing special either, but there's nothing else about him that gets me interested in him as an actor. Besides, Joachim Kaps completely trounces him in narrating the flashback. He was cast just because people might know him, and it was a very strange casting choice as well."
45,"If you're old enough, remember The Flintstone Kids, was cute for a moment, then you get over it from the bad writing."
46,"Better than the second movie, the film contains its own visual identity that is both striking and awesome at the same time! would highly recommend to Spongebob fans"
47,"Godfather this, endgame that, this is undisbutedly the greatest film ever created"
48,A terrific film with funny jokes and humor. Much funnier than the previous movie. It's a phenomenon to pay tribute to Stephen Hillenburg who sadly passed away in 2018.
49,"SpongeBob never had continuity so I didn't care! The plot is a mess, filled with plot holes, but I don't care! I watch SpongeBob for laughs, not a tight plot or script. The movie is hilarious!!! I laughed so hard!!! It felt like an amazing tribute and gratitude to Stephen hillenburg. Not as good as the first movie, but still awesome!"
50,"I've been a fan of Spongebob since the very beginning, I've seen all movies, all episodes, all specials and while I admit some episodes have been better than others, this movie is really everything I wanted it to be and more. It truly is an emotional rollercoaster.All main characters get to shine in the spotlight (Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton) even though this movie is centered around Spongebob and Patrick.This movie has a lot of fun easter eggs for old school Spongebob fans like me and has a lot of things for the whole family to enjoy as well.I can honestly say this movie is better than ""Sponge Out Of Water"" but the first movie from 2004 it's still the best one on my book.This is a must watch for every single SpongeBob fan out there, you will laugh and you will cry, but at the end of the day, you will have a really good time with this film."
51,"This was one of the best animated sequels I've ever watched, great animation, brilliant writing and beautiful soundtrack."
52,"This film start with the narrator talking about ""Bikini Bottom"", and the introduction of SpongeBob and his friends scene! As turnout, this film is about SpongeBob need to save his pet snail ""Gary"" from King Poseidon, and his nemesis ""Plankton"" try to steal his secret formula while he is away! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the tripping scene, overuse of the causing havoc scene, overuse of the playing dumb scene, overuse of the flashbacks scene, overuse of the talking with Sage scene, overuse of the dancing scene, overuse of the song playing at the background scene, and overuse of the singing scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Patrick open the prison door of SpongeBob, and back to his prison! At the end, King Poseidon release Gary and all the snails he capture! SpongeBob back to Bikini Bottom! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
53,"I made the mistake of watching this film from a filming point of view, hence the 4 rating. So I will sum that up briefly: there are so many plot holes, some unbelievably questionable acting and some random scenes (including some dancing zombies...).Now let's forget all that. From a kids point of view this is perfect. Friendship, adorable courage and a smooth talking Keanu Reeves. Spongebob and Patrick are their usual idiotic softies, Gary is still SO cute and supporting characters still do their jobs. This is a film of fun, adventure and just joy really."
54,"Now it's time for A LONG review: As you know, Sponge on the run is now released to the Netflix. Let me start off with some minor things I HATED!Let's start off with the plot, SpongeBob goes to look for Gary after Gary has disappeared, he teams up with Patrick to find Gary, who has ended up to the Atlantis City. Sounds simple and familiar as hell, doesn't it? Well, it should be cuz It's A TOTAL REHASH from the season 4 episode from the SpongeBob series, ""Have you seen this snail?""! Didn't they literally have no new plot ideas for this movie?! I guess not.Then, we've got some famous celebrities like Danny Trejo and Snoop Dogg. They were there for no reason and they got screen time for like 1-5 minutes! They were wasted!Thirdly, the summer camp scenes made no sense cuz the plot tells us that SpongeBob met his friends there, like Sandy. So what failed? Well, cuz none of this is true! In the season 1 episode ""Tea at the treedome"", SpongeBob and Sandy actually meet first time + she doesn't even mention this in the emotional speech scene in the end.Fourthly, very weak villain, Poseidon. For me (and maybe for many others), he's unfunny, weak, stupid, unmemorable and even lacking character development. The previous 2 movies had great villains (Maybe not memorable), which were both funny. The God Poseidon as a villain...? Stupid!Lastly, even the humor is bad!Let's now talk about the good things:1. As I mentioned above, the speech scene in the end where everyone, including Squidward and Mr. Krabs share their experiences with SpongeBob is a very emotional and heart-touching scene, given the fact that all of these characters have been in somewhat friendship with SpongeBob. It's a real treat that made me almost cry and is one of the best scenes in the SpongeBob movie trilogy!2. Though, the humor is very bad, It's still funny at times.These 2 things didn't make me put 1-3 stars to this movie. But still, a very forgettable film with a rehash plot, no new ideas and wasted potential."
55,I went in expecting to laugh the most of the movie but i barely laughed a couple of times .... the movie is random to the point of annoyance... and what bothered me the most is the non sense that kept showing every while of Keanu Reeves and similar scenes ... and that they messed the sponge bob origin story to the limit that it's barely Distinguishable.
56,"Movie Review #1278 - The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run. After Gary is snail-napped, SpongeBob and Patrick go on a big, dumb adventure to ""The Lost City of Atlantic City"" to save him. It's called a ""lost city"" even though there are millions of fish living there and none of the characters have any trouble finding the place, but that's neither here nor there.Firstly, the animation style is fantastic. It went the route of The Peanuts Movie and used a more stylized approach that captures the look and feel of the show while still being CG. Though I prefer SpongeBob in 2D, I thought they did a wonderful job with the art and animation.The voice acting is as good as it ever was, with all actors from the show of course reprising their roles. I like that Patrick seems less retarded than usual. There's a term called ""Flanderization"", where a single trait from a character is overstated more and more to the point that it becomes the character's only trait. Patrick is dumb and for a long time the show runners kept making him stupider every season. Thankfully, he's about as dumb as he was in seasons 1-3, dimwitted but well-meaning.The story itself really is unremarkable and filled with pointless filler. Keanu Reeves shows up and he's just there throughout the rest of the movie for no reason. I never thought I could get sick of Keanu Reeves, but here we are. Snoop Dogg is also just kinda there for a while, and Danny Trejo is just there. Why!? At least when David Hasselhoff was in the first SpongeBob movie it made a little sense. He's a lifeguard like in Baywatch. Why is Snoop Dogg performing with zombies in the old west? ""Oh, it's a dream sequence. You're overreacting."" It's a 15-minute dream sequence that amounts to absolutely nothing! There's no narrative reason for it. So much of the movie is pointless stuff to pad out the runtime. That's not inherently bad. I do like seeing SpongeBob and Patrick getting into dumb shenanigans. However, there's one unforgivable sin this movie commits.Maybe at some point in its development this was a better movie, but executives at Viacom intervened after Stephen Hillenburg's death. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run becomes a soulless backdoor pilot to a SpongeBob spinoff series. Hillenburg was vehemently against making a spinoff. He absolutely hated the idea and never wanted this to happen. Immediately after his death they stabbed him in the back and started working on Kamp Koral: SpongeBob's Under Years. Sponge on the Run has a 20+ minute scene where all the characters reminisce about meeting SpongeBob at Kamp Koral as children, even though it has NOTHING to do with the rest of the movie. This means Squidward and SpongeBob are the same age and that SpongeBob and Sandy have been friends since childhood, even though there's already an episode where SpongeBob and Sandy meet for the first time. I get that continuity in SpongeBob never really mattered that much. It's just disheartening when you grow up with these beloved characters and the higher-ups at Nickelodeon don't seem to care about them at all. They don't give a flying fish about this weird work of art that Stephen Hillenburg created. They'll keep wringing SpongeBob dry until there's nothing left. This may come as a surprise, but I'm not personally against spinoffs of SpongeBob. That possible Squidward series aimed at an older audience has me interested, and apparently Patrick is getting his own talk show. Weird, but interesting. It's all just so scummy that they would go against Hillenburg's wishes to do this.
Lastly, the music is buns. It's a generic family movie soundtrack that has no business in SpongeBob. SpongeBob has always been about sea shanties and Hawaiian tunes mixed with an assortment of other fun tracks. Sponge on the Run's soundtrack just feels soulless, especially when it shoehorns in pop music for no reason.Pointless cameos, pointless flashbacks, soulless tie-ins to Kamp Koral, pointless pop music, bland score. To be fair, the typical brand of SpongeBob humor is still here. There are plenty of good moments throughout, but when taken as a whole I can't recommend this one to longtime fans. The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run was perhaps a good movie destroyed by executive meddling. Just watch the first two movies instead!6/10"
57,"Animation style enjoyable, everything else not
Well, I did have certain expectations for this one hence the previous sequels. And, sadly, I was right. This is a SpongeBob movie that should've deserved a good plot accompanying the nice animation, but it's just a long, long disappointment.Recycled jokes, check. Too slow reactions, check. Pointless side quests, check. Pointless cameos, check. Pointless hit music, check. Forcing the story forward without a smooth transition, check. Dragging ending with a weird unfolding, check.Did not pay money for this, otherwise would want a refund."
58,"As a SpongeBob fan that grew up watching SpongeBob, I felt like this movie didn't work because of the major changes. What I mean is take Sandy for an example, in the original series Sandy met SpongeBob from a Clam fight, and in Sponge On the Run they change all of that. There's even more changes on how SpongeBob met the rest of his friends, but I won't go too deep in those because Sandy's backstory bothered me the most. The jokes, in my opinion, didn't really work for me at all. It feels disrespectful that the people behind Sponge on the Run changed nearly everything Stephen Hillenburg already created for the world of SpongeBob. The animation is really good, it's just the story and how this movie changed everything about the original SpongeBob because for the ""money""."
59,"This review will be divided into 2 parts with the first part talking a little about the message and the essence of the film and then a more critical part about the technical details.
This film shows us a very interesting aspect of SpongeBob that has always been present in the work of Stephen Hillenburg, the fact that SpongeBob is himself and manages to captivate people and change their lives, both characters in the plot and the people who grew up watching the drawing; The film takes this more emotional side and shows how SpongeBob changed the lives of characters all thanks to his charisma, his kindness and his joy. All this positive energy is easily transmitted through the big screen becoming a pleasant film to see. Proving to everyone once again that the happiness and purity of a person who is simply himself can change the world around him.Going into the technical details we can't help saying that no matter how much the cast tries and the writers try, SpongeBob and the incredible rescue still lacks the charm of the original 2004 film: Recycled jokes, useless side missions, Same goals, overall a lot of recycling of the original film. Although the film has some funny and entertaining moments the plot does not have the same fire and the same originality as the predecessors and this makes the film drag on. The 3D animation is fantastic, innovative, elegant and manages to create an atmosphere that fits perfectly with the theme of the film.
SpongeBob and the Incredible Rescue It should have deserved a good plot to accompany its beautiful animation but we received an Incredible animation an incredible lesson and a terrible Rescue 7/10."
60,"Well what can I say about SpongeBob SquarePants?, it's a hugely popular cartoon that a lot people know of, although I did really like it when I was super young but it is grossly overrated, but still a enjoyable cartoon, I also really like the first two films with the 2004 animated film still great to this day and the 2015 film ""Sponge Out of Water"" is bonkers and insane but pretty good, so I don't know about you but a third SpongeBob film sounds rather unnecessary, but hey I like SpongeBob so I'll watch it anyways, so it just came out on Netflix a few days ago when it was originally supposed to come out in May, which I thought was the best option so everyone can watch it without leaving, it was also originally supposed to titled ""It's a Wonderful Sponge"" but it was changed for some reason, so I gave it a watch yesterday and.... it wasn't that good, although not bad also, I mean what did you expect for a SpongeBob movie?, it's just what it is... so let's talk about it.SpongeBob (Tom Kenny) enjoys another day in the Bikini Bottom with his pet snail Gary, however after getting snailnapped by the King Poseidon (Matt Berry), SpongeBob and Patrick (Bill Fagerbakke) must make their way to the Lost City of Atlantic City to find Gary and save him... and that's it pretty much it, it sounds like a rather standard plot for maybe a episode of the show but this is what the film is about, but it's mainly about SpongeBob and Patrick's friendship and kind of how all of these characters met, which makes the film just too predictable and the latter kind of comes out of nowhere, it feels exactly like a run of the mill cartoon animated film with nothing really new or even original, being a SpongeBob movie it has a lot random event and jokes which mostly do work as being nonsensical but funny and entertaining like when SpongeBob and Patrick try to free these zombies from El Diablo (Danny Trejo), it still has the right amount of entertainment and humour to balance out the film, although the humour can be very well..... modern, like the mention of Skype and FaceTime and sometimes the humour can be a little too repeated and a bit annoying also, which can make the film feel long and it can drag on even longer, when they get to the city it does get a little better but then it does get kind of confusing towards the end, I'll admit there are moments of cuteness and nice moments here and there but not many, the film mainly replies on just knowledge of the show, the random humour and events and a rather quick but fitting ending, I think Tim Hill and his crew didn't really have a clue for what they wanted the film to be about, they just wanted to make another SpongeBob movie, but it feels less like a SpongeBob movie and more like a lost and convoluted half-hour special.., but longer.The animation is the only legit new element to this film, it's now CGI animation and it looks legit wonderful!.. I love the attention to detail in the characters and Bikini Bottom itself, it has that Klaus/Spider-Verse/Peanuts Movie look to it, it maybe 3-D animation but it also has that 2-D look to it also, all the characters have their big expressions and speedy movements which really work for a SpongeBob project, sometimes it can get a little too extremely and energised but it's very nice to look at, the city they go to is full of style and colour and it looks great, the new character do have a nice design to them like King Poseidon and Otto, now and then the backgrounds can look legit gorgeous and atmospheric, I can tell the animators had a lot of fun animating this, i would of been a little forgiving if they stuck to the 2-D animation but I have to give them credit for going above and beyond with the animation, it's quite unbelievable, at times I can tell it felt like a stop-motion film with the framing which is quite unique and cool, however one issue I have with the animation is actually Sandy's design, I don't know about you but she looks slightly off putting with the big eyes and small pupils, if they stuck to the big-ish pupils and smaller eyes then it would of been fine, but besides that, I love her fur texture also, but it's just the eyes that is off putting, the live action bits are bizarre but still lots of fun, it's rather debatable if this is a good film, but at least the animation gives out something that we have never seen before.The characters don't really bring anything new or different, the characters we know from the show are no different from how they are here and the new characters are rather forgettable, SpongeBob is still the loveable goofball along with Patrick but there is really nothing new to them at all, same with the other main characters like Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown), Sandy (Carolyn Lawrence), Squidward (Rodger Bumpass) and Plankton (Mr. Lawerence) are only there just to find SpongeBob because they miss him and although they are still being their funny selves, even they don't have much of point expect for how much of a impact SpongeBob has left on them, Otto (Awkwafina) is the only new character that I really enjoyed, she's pretty funny but also insane, King Poseidon is kind of entertaining but also rather confusing, Sage (Keanu Reeves) is also kind of a weird character but still kind of helpful and sometimes funny but rather distracting because of Keanu Reeve's head in the tumbleweed, other characters like the Chancellor (Reggie Watts), The Gambler (Snoop Dogg) and El Diablo are rather mixed where two of them are funny and one is.... odd.., however despite some very forgettable characters, the voice acting/physical acting is what really make these characters a ton of fun, obviously Tom Kenny, Clancy Brown and Bill Fagerbakk and the rest of the classic SpongeBob cast are entertaining as always, Awkwafina, Tiffany Haddish, Keanu Reeves and Danny Trejo do a really good job also, but Matt Berry really steals the show as Poseidon, he was also in Sponge out of Water as Bubbles so clearly Nickelodeon are fans of him I suppose?, while the characters are either nothing special or forgettable, at least the acting did make up for the lack of strong characters.The score by Steve Marrzaro and I kid you not.... Hans Zimmer is...., weird, it's not one of his best scores but it's alright, they both did the score for the Boss Baby so it's not really going to be Oscar worthy or anything like that, along with a nice song called ""Agua"" and the ""Secret to the Formula is You"" song is catchy and inventive.What else can I say about this film?, it's not good nor bad, it's just.... ehh.., decent at best?, the SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run is easily the weakest film out of all three films, it does have some funny moments and some very entertaining moments, my favourite scenes are when the gang first meet SpongeBob, the animation is a visual treat and it does go a step further in bring some great creativity, even the live action scenes are nice to look at, the voice acting from the classic cast is great as always and everyone else does great also, along with a decent-ish score and some memorable songs, however it surfers from a formulaic/cliched story, along with a creepy looking Sandy and forgettable new characters, so yeah..., I don't think it's that good but not the worst thing that SpongeBob has done, if you are a fan of the series and/or films, you'll enjoy this no matter what and I think kids will have a much better time also, while it's not good, it's better then a decent amount of animated films from this year like SCOOB! and Trolls: World Tour, but nowhere near as amazing as Onward or Wolfwalkers, but I will admit, it was a nice tribute to the late Stephen Hillenberg, say what you want about the film but at least they honoured the creator with justice, R.I.P mate, thank you for creating a great cartoon!.I'm going to give Sponge on the Run a 6.8/10."
61,"A great chapter in the animated series.
It is about Gary's disappearance and SpongeBob goes to rescue him along with Patrick.
Use the same comedy formula from the cartoon and the same situations.
The moment that combines reality and animation is well achieved.
Good soundtrack.
Good animation.
Good songs during the movie.
With cameos from Keanu Reeves, Snoop Dogg, and Danny Trejo.
Quality.
If you enjoy the series, you will love this movie as it has the essence, if not, avoid it.
An acquisition of Netflix.
Ideal to spend the afternoon."
62,"Yes, SpongeBob SquarePants is the best cartoon ever"
63,"Great movie , I really enjoyed it. Now I wish Netflix is going to add the SpongeBob show."
64,"For the ones saying this movie lacks plot or isn't as funny as you wanted it, its a children's movie aimed at CHILDREN what do you expect. Don't watch a kids movie expecting it to award winning, if you do you probably have the IQ of a child. This movie was what i expected, a movie about SpongeBob, it had a good story, was entertaining, and keep my attention throughout the movie. They had adult type jokes in it and meme references in it too, so it was pretty funny. Also to the person who said the lore wasn't in line with the show, who cares? and also how much time do you have on your hands to be researching SpongeBob lore?"
65,"It rehashes old jokes and events from previous episodes and movies, but; it is pretty cute and quite fun. Although it is kind of insulting to Hillenburg's memory, he would not have been happy with this."
66,"""Well this is a suprise, this movie is suprisingly awesome, i really don't expect too much, and if I sleep or bored well at least i don't expect anything too high, but unfortunately this movie is amazing, i really enjoyed all the scene, the comedy and the emotion, the animation is so beautiful, i really like this kinda animation, and what I'm gonna review this is the supporting actor of course because there is no way i review all this memorable 5 friends voice actor they already perfect, i just wanna review Keanu Reeves acting here, just one word for Keanu Reeves in here he is hilarious, overall this is not a movie that only good for kids, this movie is good for all people, not good because it's entertaining, but good in everything else"""
67,It is so-so at the writting and charm. but the beautiful animation and colorful visuals makes it a enough good fun for everyone and the fans (I guess).
68,This movie has alot of funny and action moments and plus its super HD this movie deserves better in my opinion
69,Im trying to find out where to watch this movie...
70,"I loved the movie, so did my kids. It's happy, non-pretentious, and as funny as SpongeBob is supposed to be. Nice cinematic, and the story full of surprises.I subtracted a point in my rating for the Reggaeton song during the movie ending titles, very forced.Surprised by the absolutely-forced-lack-of-sense spin-off introduction. Marketing sucks."
71,"This pile of garbage replaced the entire spongebob lore with an entirely different storyline and a whole lot of headache inducing humor that's been recycled from previous spongebob episodes or movies. This whole movie can be narrowed down to a quote by Keanu Reeves (if I remember it correctly): ""You two are so annoying I'm surprised I haven't lit myself on fire."" If it weren't for the visuals, it'd be a 1/10. R.I.P. Hillenburg. Your empire has officially gone down the toilet.D- or F"
72,"The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on The Run is the third movie off of SpongeBob SquarePants that everyone has been dying to see, especially in the U.S. And what's my opinion on this film? It's hmm...not bad, but nothing THAT special. But I guess I can still call it a good movie.So this movie is about, as seen in the trailer, SpongeBob has to rescue his beloved snail Gary in the Atlantic City. We already know the idea of Gary going missing has been done in the special episode ""Have You Seen This Snail?"" when Gary was snailnapped by a granny. Well in this movie he is snailnapped by King Poseidon, who apparently is a ruler of the sea (wait then who's King Neptune?) So Plankton then tries to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula realizing that SpongeBob is in the way which has been the reason he could never get the formula, so he gets Otto, the robot Sandy gifted Mr. Krabs that he didn't want, to send SpongeBob and Patrick off to Atlantic City which they both team up to save Gary once they see him at the theatre. Gary is used to keep the king from looking ugly (you'd have to actually watch it in order to understand). This gives Plankton the advantage to steal the formula finally. Oh and they also meet Sage, the guy ""stuck in the tumbleweed"" above the surface as they free the zombies (I don't even know honestly for that part). Once they notice Gary they attempt getting him back but end up in jail. Mr. Krabs, Sandy, Squidward, and even Plankton all team up to save them as they hop into the patty wagon (you know, from the first movie.) Once they make it they show flashbacks at Camp Coral showing that SpongeBob is innocent, they then fight all the guards but then King Poseidon politely comes out demanding to hand over Gary, but it twists with an ending about Poseidon not having any friends, and feeling ugly, which then changes and frees Gary as everyone lives happily every after in Bikini Bottom.Now here's my opinion, I'm gonna get to the writing last since it's the most to talk about. The animation is very well done, very colorful, and very expressive. But I do think the CGI was better in Sponge Out Of Water when above the surface. And it can be a little distracting since SpongeBob was never in a full-length CGI animated film seeing everything put together in style. But I really have nothing against this animation, it's beautiful honestly.The voice actors are great, Tom Kenny, Bill Fagerbakke, Roger Bumpass, Clancy Brown, Carolyn Lawrence, and Mr. Lawrence are amazing people for over 21 years still doing these voices. We also have Snoop Dogg in the cast surprisingly, Sage was played by Keanu Reeves, and heck Tim Hill who's helped write the entire SpongeBob series played the documentary narrator. Oddly Dee Bradley Baker only voices one role which is Perch Perkins in this movie. And all the kid actors doing the young SpongeBob voices were enjoyable too.The soundtrack was a bit of a surpise, mostly for the instrumental remake of ""Gary's Song"" (aka Gary Come Home) in the end credits, I honestly didn't think they would bring that back knowing how downhill SpongeBob went in the series. And I definitely enjoyed ""The Formula is You"".Now for the writing. Very good yet very meh at the same time. It has great theatrical quality, but also feeling a little too modern honestly. But that's fine, I also enjoyed the emotional moments this movie actually has, especially with the relationship between SpongeBob and Gary. There were honestly more heartwarming moments than adventures though, unlike in the first two movies that lacked heartwarming moments, but I suppose we can't have an equal amount of both in a Nickelodeon feature. The antagonizing also feels a little more for younger audiences to enjoy, it's not even really close to dark like in the first two movies. Quite a few scenes especially when SpongeBob and Patrick go above the surface in the west felt very random. You also get a cameo of Kelpy G (Squidward's idol). And not to mention, Patrick Star is very...fixed in this movie, which is okay I guess but at times he feels too smart than even in the early seasons of the series. But I appreciate how far improved his character is than he was in like Seasons 7-9.Additionally there is ONE thing I hate about this movie, there is a huge continuity error in one scene of the Camp Coral flashbacks when SpongeBob meets Sandy. In the series they met in the third segment of the very first episode (Tea At The Treedome) grown up when Sandy fights a clam. But here they meet as toddlers around SpongeBob's other friends as SpongeBob gets her into science and even karate which is really off the original story (which also makes me more angry at the spin-off Kamp Koral incoming also). The scenes with Patrick and Squidward work, Mr Krabs. I guess works? But it just feels very unnecessary and a bit against Hillenburg's creations.And also, apparently Plankton gets to keep the formula at the end? There's no part where Mr Krabs takes the formula back and gets the Krusty Krab back in business, this is definitely an error as well. Apparently they're friends now and The Chum Bucket is selling krabby patties (but wait Season 13 will have everything back to normal so whatever.)So I rate this film 7/10, very enjoyable but also very uh...meh and strange in-between. Kids will definitely love it, older audiences ought to find it redeeming."
73,"The movie was ok, it wasn't bad, it had memorable scenes and looked good."
74,"""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run"" (2020)...oh boy! You know I had really high hopes that this film that it won't suck and was going to be better than the sequel! Welp, I WAS WRONG!! It was even worse than ""The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water"" (2015) This film lacks good storytelling and ruins what was special about the Sponge character. WTF happened to SPONGEBOB!! The entire movie was hard to connect with, the story is bad, and it had some really lame pun jokes. Someone must've been high and written this movie sloppy! Nickelodeon...you've just killed SpongeBob! SpongeBob isn't this dumb nor is Patrick from the first three seasons of the tv shows and of course ""The SpongeBob Squarepants Movie"" (2004) a gold classic I say so myself had great humor, great storytelling, and a heartwarming ending to the franchise. WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL A STORY LIKE THAT NICK! And wasn't this supposed to be a tribute to Stephen Hillenberg? You guys should've never continued SpongeBob after the 2004 film because the whole series now is plot that doesn't know where it's going! I'm disappointed with this film and the series after the first SpongeBob film! Thank you for ruining SpongeBob! (Sarcasm)"
75,"Spongebob has become a household name. So much that they can get any star. Although I do reckon they get paid for appearing in the movie. Still, you don't do anything for money ... right? Ok maybe I'm wrong. But I was still surprised on how many people were involved in this road movie. One Dude I knew of, because of the trailer I had seen. And he is in a lot of scenes. Which makes sense, since he is the voice of reason ... be execellent to each other for sure.My nephew was quite smitten by the whole thing, but he is a fan, so depending on your relationship to the Spongebob, you'll like this more or less I reckon. It is a nicely told story overall."
76,"I liked about 75% of the film, it tries really hard to capture the original feeling of Spongebob, if not for the promotion element it may have been perfect."
77,"Good story
Good jokes
Good punchline
I dont know why people give bad review"
78,"Had a good laugh, movie is good to watch with a kids. as a parent had a good time. only 1 song! so no singing after movie :D"
79,"The 3d animation was pretty with the same awesome voice actors playing the original characters.It was funny and fun to watch, for the third spongebob movie"
80,Clearly even their cold hearts have gotten to the point wheres it cannot be thawed by good jokes that made me laugh after weeks of pile of work to do. don't listen to these nonsensical low ratings. watch it yourself and you won't regret it! < 3
81,"What a beautiful animated movie, gorgeous! The history is ok, actually is spongebob classic moments full with laughs!"
82,"Animation style enjoyable, everything else not
Well, I did have certain expectations for this one hence the previous sequels. And, sadly, I was right. This is a SpongeBob movie that should've deserved a good plot accompanying the nice animation, but it's just a long, long disappointment.Recycled jokes, check. Too slow reactions, check. Pointless side quests, check. Pointless cameos, check. Pointless hit music, check. Forcing the story forward without a smooth transition, check. Dragging ending with a weird unfolding, check.Did not pay money for this, otherwise would want a refund."
83,"Worth for snoopy snoop.
Worth for snoopy snoop.
Worth for snoopy snoop.
Worth for snoopy snoop."
84,"Sponge on the run is not as strong as its predecessors since its mostly just a regular episode of the show stretched to ninety minutes. It is still enjoyable with some decent humour and the obstacles the characters encounter, but it doesn't aim to be feature worthy like before. The characters have nothing new to offer onto the table beside those scenes when they cut back to the past. Those scenes are touching, but their purpose takes away some of the appreciation. If there is one thing the filmmakers really got right, it is the animation. It is colourful, bright and stays true to the style of the show. With giving the characters more depth with their texture. Some do benefits with more textures let like with Patrick, but others like Sandy are a bit uncomfortable to look at. Regardless of that, the animation is a thing that really gave this movie a boost."
85,"'The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run' has stunning, gorgeous-looking animation, but thin on substance. Most of the time its script feels like a rehash of the animated/movie series' plot elements that have been done before and much better. There are some funny moments, but nowhere near as many as in the first two films. Still, the movie manages to have some fun and cute qualities as well as touching and heartfelt moments throughout."
86,"Good is godddd. Snoop dog is best.... Joon
Is so good thanks nikeldoon"
87,"First movie was not really good
Second movie was interesting
And this one is very nice ! I loved it.For those who stopped watching Spongebob near season 4 / 5 because the show changed, then you can watch this one. It really has the first seasons' groove.Also, I loved the drawing of Squidward at the end. Nice touch for those who remember :P"
88,"Sponge on the Run is an extremely fun and meaningful adventure, one that'll be very impactful to the younger audience.When I was younger SpongeBob was always on the TV, a show that won't be forgotten about. I think new younger generations need to experience SpongeBob, so that it impacts them too. I understand the controversy currently going on with this film and the new show, and I think I can leave my trust with the future. As much as I want younger audiences to watch the original show, SpongeBob needs to look fresh to attract a new younger audience (that's the sad part). With the teases of Kamp Koral in this film, I'm honestly excited for it and younger generations are going to fall in love with it too. The purpose of this film was to introduce them to the characters for the show.I thought the new art style looked really fresh and somewhat unique, there was just so much detail that added so much to the world, even the small references were cool (the original show will always be referenced). The story did feel a bit bland at times, with some unneeded sections that were probably added for filler. I think the first and last quarter of the film were great though. Music choice was great as well. I found it quite hilarious as well, but I think that's because I can find anything funny.Something I can confidently say is it's a lot better than Sponge out of Water, but of course it cannot beat the original."
89,"I understand that some people are angry about the film acting as a vehicle to promote a spin off series, but that's really not a criticism towards the movie itself. I had no idea that there was a spin-off, wouldn't guess it by watching, and loved it.And seriously, complaints that the plot is non-sensical and random? Have you people ever watched Spongebob? Whining about plot holes in a Spongebob Squarepants film because ""that's not where they actually met""? Jesus. Who the hell cares?It is extremely funny exactly due to the randomness. As it always was. Every time Keanu Reeves appears is golden just because of how out of place he is. Matt Berry is as always a delight. Just stop and smell the kelp."
90,I'm 23 years old but I'm still fan of animation movies. This movie was mostly for kids not for adults but I still liked it.
91,"Following the death of Stephen Hillenburg and the sudden announcement of a spin-off, something Stephen was strongly against, it seemed this movie would've had a lot of hurdles to go through.Let's get this out of the way, they changed a lot of the show's lore for the sake of laying the groundwork for the spinoff, something fans won't shut up about, but even with that, you still have an enjoyable story to sit through. Take everything you knew about SpongeBob, shove it aside and treat it as a self-contained product, probably the mindset the ones behind Kamp Koral have.I would've been strongly opposed to this movie if it had no substance, that's obviously not the case.I will admit this is the worst film in the SpongeBob movie trilogy, it's a given for any trilogy, but it's far from being the worst movie ever."
92,"Its good, but not good enough
personally i think this movie have situations that are not important
but... my calification It is for the mention of the great Stephen Hillenburg<3, and of course 4 Keanu, Snoop y el chin%*# de Trejo. haha i love it"
93,Come on we need more for the next all the years we love sponge bob and this is a great movie and funny enjoyable you should watch!
94,"Funny and dumb movie.
The flashbacks did not make sense and did not match the series"
95,"Listen, I'm a fan of sponge bob, was raised on the original one and i find this one AMAZING! It's not a disgrace on the original.... it's a NEW TWIST WITH A VERY BEAUTIFUL ANIMATION, unexpected cameos, great jokes, music, sweet heart warming plot... i mean, i have NO IDEA what is it y'all complaining about, seriously...... have fun!"
96,I have been watching SpongeBob since it first came out in the 90s and I just can't get used to the change in style. Not everything has to be made in 3D. I hated the desing and it was actually kinda gross in some scenes. Just leave SpongeBob alone and let him be as we know him a very pretty funny and cute 2D little yellow sponge.
97,"Is it the worst kids' movie I've ever watched? No. Is it the best? Hell, no. I am surely not a fan of this type of animation, although that's the second movie being done in this style (so someone must have liked it I guess?!).Anyway, there were some really heart-felt moments, but most of the script was full of unnecessary scenes, which in my opinion were added just for the celebrities bits to make some sort of sense. I get it, you want some
David Hasselhoff moment, but this wasn't it.Watch it, or don't. Probably won't make a difference."
98,"Was this Netflix produced? It has that big-budget, no-heart feel. From the very beginning, you get a narrator whose gender you can't even pinpoint. How very Netflix. The animation is this soulless Minions-style slick 3D one, that's visually impressive, but not what anyone expected or wanted. Just something trendy to blow the budget on, and cover for the horrible writing.This is absolutely a Shrek clone, following the exact same formula. An unexpected hero (Spongebob/Shrek) has to save a princess/snail from a self-centered ruler (Farquad/Neptune-or-whatever). Along the way, our hero along with his dim-witted comic relief friend (Donkey/Patrick) pointlessly have a fight, only to make up later and finish their mission with a happy end. Even the same Shrek song, Living Da Vi Da Loca is reused here. You know, that old song about a guy who gets roofied and robbed by a woman, that lovely child-friendly song that Shrek and this movie seem to love? I wonder if the genders were reversed and the song was about a man drugging and robbing a woman, would they still love it so much, or are they unoriginal, unthinking, double-standards losers?It really does suck, the writing, despite the flashy visuals, this won't keep your kids' attention, it's a waste of voice acting talent and yet another exploitation and greedy destruction of something we all knew and loved."
99,Can any on tell me how can I watch the movie? Pls tell me
