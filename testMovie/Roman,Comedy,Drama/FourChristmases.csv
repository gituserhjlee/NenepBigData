0,"Four Christmases starring Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn, I suppose I can accept it, just very strange seeing them as a couple on screen together. But anyways, every year we get a Chrismas movie, it's either going to be fun or really bad, sorry to say, but Four Christmases is nothing special, another year with an easy to forget movie. But still while this movie doesn't really stand out and it is incredibly predictable, there are some really fun moments. We at least finally have the split up family vs just one crazy family. Reese really turned on the charm and stole this movie, she was so adorable and she was great in the jump jump scene with the evil kids. Vince had some moments as well, but it's more the supporting cast that was just a fun addition to the story.When upscale, happily unmarried San Francisco couple Kate and Brad find themselves socked in by fog on Christmas morning, their exotic vacation plans morph into the family-centric holiday they had, until now, gleefully avoided. Out of obligation-and unable to escape-they trudge to not one, not two, but four relative-choked festivities, increasingly mortified to find childhood fears raised, adolescent wounds reopened...and their very future together uncertain. As Brad counts the hours to when he can get away from their parents, step-parents, siblings and an assortment of nieces and nephews, Kate is starting to hear the ticking of a different kind of clock. And by the end of the day, she is beginning to wonder if their crazy families' choices are not so crazy after all.I would recommend Four Christmases just if you wanna see a cute holiday movie in the theater this year. Vince and Reese had good chemistry and this movie just represents the craziness of having to go to all the families every year for Christmas. There are some really good laughs here and there, I loved the scene where Reese played the Virgin Mary and Vince was Joesph in their church play and Reese just gets stage fright and freezes while Vince just makes a fool of himself on stage. Over all this is a cute movie, there's nothing special about it, but it's worth the look.6/10"
1,"Sigh. Another potentially funny Hollywood comedy hits the skids when it encounters a message. The message here seems to be, ""Families Are Hideous And Awful, But Everyone Should Be Forced To Have One"". No, I don't understand the logic of that either.The families are made up of 4 sets of familiar comedy archetypes - the yokels, the interfering women, the religious kooks and - um - the fourth set who the writers couldn't be bothered to make interesting or unusual. I suppose you can't blame them for losing interest - I know I had.Phoned-in performances and a faxed-in script result in a charmless, pointless holiday film. The only good thing about it is the charisma of the leads, and a funny appearance by Jon Favreau. But seriously, you would be better advised to watch National Lampoon's Xmas Vacation again instead."
2,"This is without a doubt one of the worst movies of 2008. The movie suffers from the lack of chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon. It's the core of the movie and we never believe in them as a couple. We drift through the movie from one embarrassingly unfunny scene to another including a sequence where Vaughn's brothers, who are Ultimate Fighters attack him, an attempt to put up a satellite dish where everyone and everything falls over. More pitiful scenes follow. A reenactment of the nativity scene is presumably added to pad this garbage out and just when you think things can't get worse....they do! The final 10 minutes goes for soppy sentimaentality with the couple's 'relationship' which is totally out of keeping with this surprisingly mean spirited 'comedy'. It doesn't matter since we never believed in them as a pair to begin with. This train wreck is ended when a baby, for the second time, projectile vomits over Reese Witherspoon. An unbelievably awful film."
3,"This rudely rambunctious, intermittently funny 2008 holiday comedy is a supreme case of Hollywood overkill along the lines of Jay Roach's ""Meet the Fockers"". Running a scant 89 minutes, it stars no less than five Oscar-winning actors in the standard cookie-cutter story of a commitment-phobic couple who are forced to visit each of their four divorced parents on Christmas day. Co-written by first-timers Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson, along with Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (who co-wrote ""The Hangover""), the premise shows promise with Kate and Brad, a pair of self-satisfied, upwardly mobile San Franciscans meeting for what looks like the first time in a bar. Their sharp-tongued banter turns out to be a role-playing fantasy since they are three years into their comfortable relationship. A major fog blanket rolls over the city and ruins their plans for a holiday vacation in Fiji. What's worse is that they are caught by a local news camera at the airport. Because they deceived their families into thinking they were traveling overseas to help starving third-world children, they embark on a daylong journey to each of their parent's houses, all conveniently located in the Bay Area.However, the movie starts to decline precipitously with each visit. The first home the couple drops by belongs to Brad's redneck father, where his other sons, cage-fighting brothers Denver and Dallas tackle Brad with painful wrestling moves. It ends with an uncomfortable gift exchange where Brad's expensive gifts humiliate his blue-collar family. The couple then visits Kate's overly affectionate mother and a den of cougars, an episode in which it is revealed Kate had a childhood weight problem and a possible lesbian past. Brad's therapist mother is next on the itinerary, but he's still angry that she married his best friend, who is half her age, and a game of Taboo reveals the communication gulf that really exists between Kate and Brad. The last stop is at the home of Kate's father, and this is where the tone gets serious-minded as the couple learns a lesson in the value of being with family in spite of whatever personal differences may exist to divide them the rest of the year.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon - he with his semi-improvised riffing, she with her exacting intelligence - would seem to be absurdly mismatched, but they spar convincingly, even if they do look more like best friends than lovers. Vaughn gets to shine in a Christmas pageant scene where he basks in the limelight of his ham-fisted stage debut. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight play the parents with little screen time, and only Duvall leaves much of an impression as an embittered shell of a man. Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Carol Kane, and Kristin Chenoweth gamely play various relatives in equally smallish roles. The whole venture is directed by Seth Gordon, whose only previous feature-length credit is the critically praised video-game documentary, ""The King of Kong"", and his storytelling inexperience shows in the sometimes ADD-level pacing of the story. The 2009 DVD, being released for the holidays, doesn't offer much in terms of extras other than two different screen formats."
4,"Sophomoric humor, disjointed plot, obnoxious delivery, lack of direction, and poor pacing married to a feeble attempt to intertwine a serious philosophical issue throughout its unbelievably contrived and stilted storyline (the issue was whether or not to bring offspring into the world, but by the end you have come to have so much disdain for the main characters that you are practically screaming, ""Please, don't breed!"" by the time they do). Overall, just a superbly painful movie to sit through. Further, it was most disheartening to see a stellar collection of supporting actors (Duval, Spacek, Voight) wasted in a horrendous vehicle such as this one. My recommendation is that if you can watch it for free . . . you will still have paid too much. This is a Christmas movie quickly destined for the post-Christmas gift exchange department.On a brighter note, my wife hated it more than I did."
5,"After last years foray into Christmas movies with the comedy without the comedy Fred Claus, Vince Vaughn is back this year again with another festive attempt - Four Christmases with Reese Witherspoon.The plot involves a couple Brad (Vaughn) and Kate (Witherspoon) as they struggle to spend Christmas Day with all for of their divorc√©e parents.No matter the logistical problems of visiting four equally quirky parents the most unbelievable part of the whole movie was believing that the cuddly (fat if you are not a fan!) Vaughn could pull a girl like Reese Witherspoon but oddly enough it did work and there was some chemistry there despite set grumblings that the two did not get on very well.As with all comedies chemistry is important but so is the comedy. Vince Vaughn is a known to stray from the script and when this works it is hilarious but when it doesn't it truly fails. His one memorable scene and in fact the only laugh out loud scene in the whole movie is the nativity scene.I would give the movie 5/10. It was released well in time before the main Christmas Films in order not to completely bomb at the Box Office.The movie was good but I would wait a year and rent it next Christmas. It is the Christmas comedy which forgot all about the Christmas...and the comedy."
6,"It's been a while since Hollywood gave us a genuinely good Christmas movie worth seeing. If you notice, the Christmas TV line-up is the same each year and the most modern film usually on the list is THE SANTA CLAUSE (1993). This just goes to show that, sadly, Hollywood isn't creating Christmas classics as it once did. Perhaps one of these years we will get a Christmas film reminiscent of the ones we love to watch on TV every year, but this ain't that year - or at least FOUR CHRISTMASES isn't that film.The problem doesn't lie within the film's premise, but in the actual events that play out in the film. Kate and Brad live life with and for each other and that's it. They don't have much contact with their families - where each parent is divorced and some remarried - and each Christmas opt for a tropical vacation, telling their families they are doing charity work instead. All in all, they are happy with each other, but have buried their family issues. However, this year they get caught in their lie and are forced to visit each parent individually, celebrating a total of four Christmases. In the hands of an able and creative script writer this film could have been quite enjoyable as both Kate and Brad learn to appreciate their families and not exclude certain things - mainly marriage and children - in their lives just because their parents are bad examples of them. Instead, each visit with a parent seems to be a drawn out slapstick or sex joke and nothing else and is just not in any way funny or clever.The film suffers from a lack of intelligence and it is shocking that it attracted the star power it did. The star's talents are hardly used and instead the film opts for over-sexed relatives, ultra violent brothers and insanely disobedient children - who get no reprimanding for their actions. As a genre of film that almost lends itself to families this one missed the mark and is not recommended for the kids. As an adult-geared Christmas film it just isn't funny. Adult humor can be funny and appropriate if there is other substance backing up the film - see 'KNOCKED UP' or 'FORGETTING SARAH MARSHALL.' All we are offered in FOUR CHRISTMASES is one boring and uninspired vignette after the next with paper-thin character development and uninteresting characters.With rarely an enjoyable moment and an atmosphere that provides almost no Christmas spirit, FOUR CHRISTMASES shouldn't be on anyone's list of holiday films. It is the awkward gift given by a relative. You know the type. It comes in a pretty package, but upon opening you find that it is a pair of underwear or a sweater that is designed to sit at the back of closets. This film surely will."
7,"Greetings again from the darkness. Vince Vaughn is starting to remind me of what Woody Allen went through ... ""I liked his funny movies"". Just wasn't a fan of ""Wedding Crashers"" or ""The Break-up"", but I certainly recognize his comedic talents. Here, his quirks play a little better, though I never really bought off on he and Reece Witherspoon as a couple.Low expectations, a strong cast, a few clever lines, easily relatable family strain, and a true sight ""gag"" make this one enjoyable enough. The trailer gives away the set-up of the film as Reece and Vince are forced to visit all four pieces of their disjointed families on Christmas. For some reason, director Seth Gordon (""King of Kong"") casts Robert Duvall and Sissy Spacek as VV's parents and Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen as Reece's. The curiosity stems from the age difference between these actors ... a 15-16 year span. Just struck me as odd. Though not quite as odd as Jon Voight offering parental advice. Now THAT is comedy! Despite the hi-jinx, the messages abound: we all have the weirdest family, it is never easy to really connect with another person, and it's always a good time for cheese whiz. This is really VV's film as Reece has little to offer save for the bounce bounce scene. Mr. Vaughn is truly at his best in the moments of rapid fire dialogue as he helplessly tries to avoid another ridiculous situation.One warning to parents: the film is rated PG-13 and there is a segment regarding the Santa secret, so be forewarned. The unwritten rule is broken. The quick lines and uncomfortable family moments make this one worth a few giggles. Not a Christmas classic, but a decent comedy.I must mention the tribute to the classic ""A Christmas Story"" as the kids peer into the toy store window early on. That scene is followed by the airport scene, where the ticket agent is played by none other than Peter Billingsley, a grown up Ralphie from that movie (and producer of this film)."
8,"To be fair, I should explain right away I had no intention of seeing this movie at all not to mention Vince Vaughn hasn't done anything very good like Swingers and Made in some time (to me, Wedding Crashers and The Break Up were just O.K.). In fact, the bitter taste from last year's disappointing Fred Claus was still present when my girlfriend said she wanted to see this movie tonight. Of course, I cringed at the idea while mildly protesting but eventually gave in with the prospect of secretly indulging in an unspoken ""I told you so"". Only kidding, that thought never crossed my mind...Anyways, I didn't even really know what this was about before seeing it but it didn't take long for the plot to be outlined after a pretty funny scene at the airport. Basically, after 3 years of avoiding spending time with their families on Christmas (remember, you can't spell families without ""lies""), Kate and Brad find themselves in an unfortunate situation this year that forces them to spend Christmas with their divorced parents and very dysfunctional siblings. This concept could go either way for me because I really liked Christmas Vacation but disliked The Family Stone. Fortunately, just as it started out great this continued to be more like Christmas Vacation all the way through with several laugh out loud funny dialog and various slapstick that had the whole theater roaring with laughter. One of my favorite parts was a Nativity play where Vince Vaughn effectively delivers some hilarious over the top scenery chewing that had everybody in stitches... well, except Kate.As funny as I thought this was, it wouldn't be a real Christmas movie without delivering some sort of constructive message among all the chaos. Since I can empathize with Vaughn in his situation with Kate, the film's resolution probably had more personal impact for me. I can also understand the criticism that most of the talented cast was wasted in comparison because the family situations were not addressed equally. What I liked the most about the film's brief serious turn is it wasn't syrupy while providing some genuine touching moments thanks to the believable acting skills of Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughn and of course the two screen legends, Bobby DuVall and Jon Voight. Best Christmas movie I've seen since Bad Santa and yes, I will listen to my girlfriend's suggestions without being such a Scrooge from now on:)"
9,"Just watched this movie few hours ago. It was like a shocking therapy. This has been one of the most bad movies I have ever seen. No plot, no idea, no ""healthy humor"". Only sick sex jokes and pregnancy subjects. The movie is not about Christmas: it has nothing to do with Christmas. The movie is about a girl (Witherspoon) and a guy (Vaughn): the girl finally decides that she wants to get pregnant. No use to describe movie here: those who want to watch it, don't fall asleep. I watched the movie and now regretting that I wasted two hours on that. It is not surprising: Witherspoon can't play anybody else but pregnant girls or silly lawyers; Vaughn - it is still a mystery why he agreed to do this movie. Awful. 1/10."
10,"My friend and I saw this movie tonight and did get a few laughs. We really liked the cast and thought overall the movie was ""cute"".We both noticed how Reese Witherspoon's hair kept ""changing"".. In the same clip the camera would be on her and her bangs would be straight and side-swept. Camera goes to Vince Vaughn. Camera goes back to Witherspoon and her bangs are fuller and covering her forehead. The color would change from scene to scene. It was bizarre. We laughed more at the hair issue than the movie itself. We wondered how many others in the audience noticed. It was really obvious.Clearly we are easily entertained... ;-)"
11,"4/10 - a holiday flick that squanders the immense talents of its cast, particularly Reese Witherspoon, Kate Mixon, and Kristin Chenoweth"
12,"This film has the perfect setup to be a big hit...it comes out on DVD over the holidays when (many) people are, after a day or two, trying to get away from the relatives for awhile, and the plot even centers on that same subject matter! Yet, through a multitude of problems, first and foremost being the continued dumbing down of what people must think is funny, it fails to resonate on any level.Basically, the story sees a couple (played by Reece Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn) trying to escape their holiday family get-togethers due to tension from both sets of parents. However, when their flight to Fiji is cancelled due to fog, they are forced to spend the day at four different homes (both sets of their parents are divorced) celebrating Christmas. They meet a wide variety of odd characters and even begin to drift away from each other once past secrets begin to be revealed.While that may sound like an interesting concept, it just doesn't get off the group. First, the lead couple, though played by the very competent Witherspoon and Vaughn, are so unlikable that you really can't get drawn into their relationship. In fact, you may actually root AGAINST them as they are so annoying. Secondly, the auxiliary family members that should bring the comedy to the film are, in actually, quite annoying themselves also. Not until the last home do you get a touch of interesting character development, but by then you really don't care anymore.However, the biggest problem with the entire film is that it relies on far too many sight gags and an over abundance of crude humor. The scenes in the film that should get the biggest laughs involve ""Vaughn"" falling off a roof, a breast pump, and a baby vomiting. Now I suppose that when it comes to humor it's sort of ""to each his own"", but personally I feel that resorting to that type of humor is a cheap way to get a chuckle (if that) and doesn't really endear itself to viewers.Thus, here is the real test of whether or not I found this to be enjoyable whatsoever: After finishing it, I flipped around my cable TV and found two great films on...Father of the Bride and When Harry Met Sally. After just 15 minutes of flipping back and forth between those two, I had more laughs than during the entire 88 minutes of Four Christmases."
13,This has got to be the worst movie ever made!!!. Reese Witherspoon sleep walks her way through this movie and hardly ever makes eye contact with Vince Vaughan!!. Vomiting babies and siblings trying to wrestle each other just don't do it for me!!. I must admit Vince did try his best to make some humor but was terribly mismatched with Witherspoon. They had zero chemistry and it looked like Witherspoon at times just wanted to run off set and never come back!!. I just don't get why she keeps making comedies as she is so much better at Drama and is a good actress as proved by her Oscar and other awards she has won. I say don't waste your money on this it is an absolute stinker!!.
14,"Where to begin on this one. I didn't really have high hopes for this one, as the commercial made it look really boring, but I got forced into going. I figured hey, Vince Vaughn is awesome, he will probably make it bearable. Yeah, he didn't.For starters, he and Reese Witherspoon have no chemistry. Their relationship is annoying and they aren't likable characters who you can cheer for. The whole movie is packed with big name actors, but there isn't a single one who is likable, and it makes it really difficult to care as the movie drags on.Finally, the most painful part was when they let Vince Vaughn just talk incessantly, especially in the later stages of the movie. I loved his rambling style in other movies, but in this one I just want to reach out and slap him.Avoid, there really isn't anything good about this movie."
15,"This movie produces non stop laughter in our house! Vince Vaughn does his 'thing' better than ever, while Reese is great playing his girlfriend. The rest of the cast is top notch and a perfect mixture of family stereotypes! You owe it to yourself, if you have a sense of humor about holidays and family get togethers, to see this movie!"
16,"Brad and Kate, an urbanite unmarried couple with no plans to tie the knot or ever have children, are forced to visit their respective families after bad weather grounds planes and keeps them from going on their yearly tropical Christmas vacation together. And so we the audience are treated to nonstop cruelty, violence, profanity, and humorless mockery of the Christmas tradition for the rest of the film.When Brad and Kate aren't being attacked, vomited on, and belittled, they're bickering about their increasingly deteriorating relationship, which is maybe not as solid as they thought. There is some funny dialogue, and the fish-out-of-water classism is amusing at times. But a few witticisms once in a while can't make up for the rest.Four Christmases had potential; as a concept, it makes sense. Nearly everyone can relate to dysfunctional family comedies, and with four families in the mix this movie could have been hilarious. Instead, it's relentlessly cruel. If the script had been tempered with any kind of warmth, love, or holiday spirit, perhaps it would have been a Christmas classic. Unfortunately, the writers saw fit only to mock Christmas and Christians both under the pretenses of making a Christmas movie.That the filmmakers loathe Christmas and everything it stands for is evident in every scene. That they expect their Christian, or Christmas-celebrating audiences to laugh along with their pathological hatred of the holiday and its higher meaning is absurd. The cast is indisputably talented but their skills are wasted on this charmless, unfunny bore. What a shame."
17,"O come all ye faithful. That certainly seems to be the attitude that studios have at the holidays, sputtering out yearly Christmas flicks and luring all the little 'children' to their theatres made of gingerbread¬Öno matter how god-awful that movie may be. Those thinking that Four Christmases must be four times the fun of a normal Christmas movie, are about to get a truckload of coal at their front door, because you'll receive nothing but four times the pain, four times the tripe and four times the garbage.2008 marks the second year in a row a Vince Vaughn yuletide film has met the silver screen. I will not claim to have seen Fred Claus but I can honestly not envision it being any worse, and if it is then all those involved must simply hate the holiday season. Ironically it truly is the films gimmick that is its greatest determent. Of course if the film had been remotely funny then this would have been an asset, but being forced slog through two hours of atrocious slapstick and mean- spirited comedy is not how I wish to spend my valuable vacation time. With such talent involved, the absolute failure of Four Christmases is all the more lasting and if not for Vince Vaughn who gets the films only (and very, very few) laughs, the Grinch himself would have loved it.Following the only clever scene in the film in which Brad (Vince Vaughan) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) meet in a bar (although not to the end which you may expect) they plan their annual holiday trip down south for sun, relaxation and as an added bonus an ocean between them an their families. But following heavy fog in their home city of San Francisco their flight is delayed, and thanks to a pesky reporter are featured on the news, which of course their families are watching. Thus begins the hilarity, with the duo visiting each of their four divorced parents including Brad's father (an awful Robert Duvall) his professional fighter brothers Denver (an awful John Favreau) and Dallas (Tim McGraw) and his mother (Sissy Spacek). And on the other side, Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen) her baby loving sister Courtney (Kristin Chenoweth) and father (Jon Voight, who adds the only gravitas to the film). As the couple hops from home to home their relationship is put to the test. Will they learn the true meaning of family?In its wholeness, Four Christmases is really a spiteful and mean- spirited film where all the characters do, is fight. Kate and Brad fight, Kate and Brad fight with their families and their families fight amongst themselves, and I for one don't want to be watching material like that around what is supposed to be a joyous time of year. They openly avoid their families and their families really want nothing to do with them. Not a single person in this film seems like a real person and never encounter problems or family quirks that might hit home (and really people, if it does, take your family to see a shrink) in addition to having no characters which are in any way likable. I mean this truthfully, after the first Christmas I was ready to leave, and the same slapstick surfaces again and again like the appetizer you accidentally dropped in the egg nog at an open house; Baby spittle scenes, UFC takedowns and crude sexist jokes seem to make up this films backbone.A few times throughout Four Christmases the quip ""You can't spell families without lies"" appears. If this is what the Christmastime spirit is going to embody in the future of Hollywood, then you might as well just shove the ol' tannenbaum in the trash right now, which coincidently, is exactly where this piece of dreck belongs as well.View all my reviews at Simon Says Movie Reviews: www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
18,"The movie has all of the potential to be a great comedy classic, but it seems to have to much Vaughn influence in the writing. Jon Favreau should have taken more control in creating this movie because his character was the best and funniest and we all know he can write a screenplay. Vince's shtick is getting really old and I didn't find him funny at all, Vaughn is becoming very very predictable.Reese Witherspoon is withering and her cutesy faces are not so cutesy anymore. Her lines are humorous but she is not. Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight, and Sissy Spacek have solid performances. Duvall was hilarious.However, since Favreau & Duvall have minor roles in this movie, this movie is weak in the laugh department.Usually, I tell people to wait for the movie to come out on DVD or HBO. In this case, don't buy it; if you miss it on HBO or Showtime, TBS or ABC will have it on in 2 years.Too make a long review short, if you miss this movie, your life and your wallet will have more to give."
19,"This movie is unwatchable.With the impressive cast, this movie promises to entertain, but instead annoys and disappoints. You at first begin to dislike the scenes, and then as it goes on, you begin to dislike the characters, and as it goes on further, you begin to dislike the actors, even if you've liked them in other movies. The movie is so bad, that it makes even the movie house popcorn taste bad.Even after the movie moves on to a watchable scene, the reappearance of a minor character from a dreadful scene brings back the feeling of dread and spoils even the watchable scene. And as a Christmas movie, it has as much charm as listening to a tone deaf singer work their way through all your favourite Christmas carols. You find yourself hoping that you're able to suppress the memory of this movie when Christmas does come around.Bah, and humbug."
20,"I always thought that all films had to contain at least one character you could like or at worst empathise with. When a film begins with its 'heroes' lying to their parents I found it impossible to 'bond' with them. This film then spends the bulk of its airtime showing us how awful Witherspoon & Vaughn's families are ,and how little Witherspoon & Vaughn know about each other. The presumed payoff is that they become (partly) reconciled to their families and (we assume) keep them in their lives. It was, therefore, a cynical surprise that the last scene made it obvious that Witherspoon & Vaughn's characters had reverted to type. This film has a 12A certificate in the UK, meaning that small children can see it; it has several unsuitable scenes, including the sex in the toilet opening and Vaughn destroying the Santa Claus story. All in all a romantic Christmas comedy that was neither romantic, nor Christmassy nor funny."
21,"My husband and I attend a movie at least three times a month and I believe we have a good sense of humor, but this was the most humorless movie we have seen in a long time. I laughed more at the new Kevin James movie preview than I did at this movie. It was so bad my husband almost went to sleep during it. I kept hoping something really funny would happen, but it never did. I feel like Reese Witherspoon was wasted in this movie. I have loved most of her movies, but she should have bowed out of this one. As for Vince Vaughn I keep wondering why he is so popular. Also the scene in the church was disgustingly bad and for those who know the true meaning of Christmas it was an insult."
22,"I don't know why everyone hates on this movie, I laugh through the entire thing. I have seen it probably 5 times now, and still enjoy it. It also has a stellar cast with Robert Devall, Tim McGraw, I mean come on, it even has Dwight Yoakam in it. It's funny, light hearted, and sweet at the end. Anyway, I just thought people should give it a chance. It had bad reviews when it came out, and my mom and I saw it in theaters and disagreed with the reviews then."
23,"I thought this one had promise.Yet, I almost walked out in the first 15 minutes to ask for my money back. Unfortunately, I stayed until the end.This movie was not funny at all. It had bad acting (from people who really should have known better and who, in other films, actually show that they do have some talent - you wonder why they even wanted to associate themselves with this one). It was a waste of my time and money.I was really hoping for a good Christmas movie to get in the mood for the holidays. This one wasn't it."
24,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon are Brad and Kate ... a couple who are so happy with their relationship that they don't ever want to spoil it by getting married. Besides, both of them are children of divorce and thus they're in no hurry to tie any knots themselves. So after they've fornicated before the credits (always suitable for a Christmas movie), they decide they'll skip Christmas by going to Fiji, but give their parents some b.s. excuse every year about traveling to help orphans (""You can't spell 'families' without 'lies' "", Brad rationalizes). When it turns out all airline flights are cancelled due to fog, their problem is made worse when they're interviewed ""live"" at the airport by the news, and their families see them. So they have no choice but to make four trips in one day to visit each of their divorced parents on Christmas. All the families in the film are weird to one extent or another -- Brad's two brothers are wrestlers who beat him up mercilessly; his dad (Robert Duvall) is a redneck ol' cuss. His mom (Sissy Spacek) is now shagging her son's younger best friend. Kate's mother (Mary Steenburgen) is sex-starved. Jon Voight is in there somewhere as Kate's pop. I could go on, but the point is that there's a good deal of crude and toilet-type humor on display here (a lot of babies with projectile vomiting, for example) and not that much of it is humorous. Doesn't feel very ""Christmas-y"", either. I always thought the idea of Christmas movies is to want to re-view them annually each year with the family as tradition. But why anyone would want to see the majority of ""holiday"" films of this decade over again is beyond me. ** out of ****"
25,"It's as if these comedians had a bunch of random family-related scenes that got cut out of other things and decided to cobble them together into a movie. It didn't work.This movie has two good points. The very first scene, which introduces the two protagonists, is sharp and original. The very last scene is neat and funny. Almost nothing in the middle was any good.The most crippling problem is probably one conversation that Vince Vaughn's character's has with his girlfriend. It's supposed to represent him coming to terms with the issue behind their last fight, but he does so by making a series of sarcastic jokes that are not meant to be taken literally and have no emotional depth. In other words, the scene is trying to tell us that the character can be serious but it's showing us that he can't. It just wasn't well thought out."
26,"Okay, come on, this story line has been recycled a few times, so let's not expect that you won't be able to predict what will happen. Once you get past the high expectations, you'll be able to relax and actually enjoy the humorous points that in this movie.The actors/actresses did a good job of playing their characters and there were only a few scenes when it was just too painful to watch, but the laughing out loud with the crowd at some of the scenes just out numbered those painful points.Vince delivered as expected and so did the rest of the star-studded cast. Worth a watch in theaters or on DVD."
27,"Ah the Christmas movie, is there anything more fitting and resembling of its subject matter when it comes to big screen adaptations? Much like the holiday season itself however, one can't assume absolute objectivity; Christmas is undoubtedly a holiday that is about family, joy and celebration and yet there are hordes of people who anticipate the ringing on sleigh bells with about as much excitement as a turkey waiting to be put into an oven. Four Christmases surprisingly accommodates this somewhat polarising aspect of the holiday during its initial stages, but then promptly spirals into clich√© storytelling for the sake of proving a warm and fuzzy ending to melt the bitter snow in our hearts. What's most surprising however is that the movie's sugary latter half actually works a whole lot better than its former, as director Seth Gordon never quite hits the ball on his intended edgy comedy routines. In the end what you end up with is something akin to a dangerously half-cooked turkey dinner that has its moments and yet fails to satisfy because of the amount of picking you have to do. It's standard Christmas-time affair that will be sure to mildly please those who are into such a thing, but for the rest of us, it's just another thing on the list to avoid.The name of the game this time around is, yes, you guessed it; family. Well, that, and dysfunction (of course). Four Christmases, a movie about finding out about the real joys of life ¬ñwhich resolve to be not exotic holidays or gifts, but real, honest companionship- never goes anywhere new with what it has to say; if you've seen any number of cookie-cutter Christmas movies, you've pretty much seen this. To its advantage and at times disadvantage, the script penned by a whole array of writers I'm not even going to bother listing does broaden its horizons with comedy that stays true to the sub genre's a-typical formula but branches off with a little more risqu√© material. As to whether or not the risks reap any rewards is something of a mixed bag; there are moments when Four Christmases is genuinely funny, and the performances do well to get this across, but with far too many misses and an overwhelming lack of such instances, the movie certainly isn't going to have you out of your seat. That of course doesn't mean that there isn't fun to be had here, because there is; this is a feature that is bound to lightly amuse more than cause a ruckus of laughter, and for that there is a certain amount of praise warranted.Where Four Christmases slips up quite often though lies in the tepid romance that is supposed to be getting some analytical treatment here. The story of Brad and Kate is not a new one; madly in love for three years, the two have been sharing a life of luxury together for a long time now, and yet never really got to know each other in the process. The movie opens with a rather striking sequence that even shows the two role-playing in public as cooked up personas, which is interesting considering how little time they have spent getting to know each other. Of course, this is an interesting premise, but little is done to capitalise on it script wise. When it comes to the performances of Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, the dynamism and chemistry is just as rigid and dead; there is no believable spark present and no genuine moments of heart-warming romance. In fact, the most believable moments that occur between Vaughn and Witherspoon is when they are at odds with each other; again this plays into the movie's much more engaging comedic edge, but does little to pad out the silliness. On their own, the two thespians provide great performances respectively, but brought together there's an imbalance that never quite allows either of them to connect.If there's one thing that the movie does get right however, it's conveying the frantic chaos inherent to the holiday, especially when it comes to family celebrations and get-togethers. Of course it's standard fare that has been done countless other times in far greater features, but in amongst the many problems that Four Christmases suffers from, such moments of awkward and often slapstick family confrontations fulfil their purpose of tickling the audience far greater than any of the other lacking elements. For a Christmas movie, it's not bad, but it's not great either; throwing in sporadic comedy and fun with lukewarm romance and lazy plotting, Four Christmases isn't anything new for holiday movie lovers to soak up, but it certainly isn't anything to loose any sleep over either. Instead it simply exists as a throw away for a couple of hours of silly entertainment to lighten the spirits; it may not do its job coherently, but it does so enough to satisfy those that target such affairs.A review by Jamie Robert Ward (http://www.invocus.net)"
28,"Couple Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) have been dating for three years but have no interest in getting married or having babies. They avoid their families (4 of them--both of their parents are divorced) by saying they have some charity mission to do. However they're caught on camera one Christmas and have to promise to visit all their 4 families that one day. Naturally all their families are somewhat strange and familiar (but funny) complications ensure.I saw this for a few reasons--it got good reviews from critics; it's been an OK hit (so far); I like Vaughn and Witherspoon and it's hard to resist a movie with FOUR Academy Award winning actors in supporting roles--Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight. It's not a great movie at all but it had a few good laughs and--at 88 minutes--it doesn't wear out its welcome. Supposedly Vaughn and Witherspoon didn't get along at all while working on this but you'd never know it from the film. They have some great chemistry and their comedic timing is right on target. The rest of the cast is as good as anyone could be and they all act well enough to make the entirely predictable story go down smoothly. It's not perfect. I could have lived without the TWO instances of projectile vomiting and Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw were too vicious and unfunny as Vaughn's brothers. Some people find seeing other people beaten up hysterically funny but I'm not one of them. Still these are small parts of the movie. All in all a good enjoyable holiday film."
29,"Java Man Reviews ""Four Christmases"" (PG-13) Directed by Seth Gordon. Written by Matt R. Allen & Caleb Wilson and Jon Lucas & Scott Moore. Starring Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughn, Jon Voight, Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, Sissy Spacek, Jon Favreau, Carol Kane, Kristin Chenoweth and Tim McGraw. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com November, 2008.OVERVIEW:Brad and Kate (Vaughn and Witherspoon) are a happily UNmarried San Francisco couple who have a unique holiday tradition: Every year they embark upon a Christmas vacation to a sunny locale after fibbing to their families about where they are bound. This year they say, Burma for charity work, but it's really Fiji for frolicking. As they head for the airport, we see the Golden Gate bridge shrouded in fog. All flights are canceled, and worse yet, they get caught on camera when the nightly news does a segment on stranded passengers. They're busted . . . and expected to show up at each of their four divorced parents' homes for Christmas. If you are part of a dysfunctional family (and you know that you are), then just imagine your worst Christmas ever, and multiply that by four. REVIEW: 2.5 out of 4 Java MugsYou would think that when Brad and Kate find that their flight to Fiji has been canceled, it would arouse sympathy in the audience. Well, forget it! If we have to live through another family Christmas, so do they. In fact, we want to watch them suffer, because, as it turns out, their Christmas Day is going to turn out much worse than yours or mine. The story is simple, and we have seen much of it before. With four divorced parents, their partners, and an array of siblings and step-siblings, every archetype of family dysfunction is on display. Brad gets ambushed and assaulted by his cage-fighting brothers (Favreau and McGraw), as Kate looks on in shock. Kate is humiliated about her childhood eating habits by her sister and mother (Chenoweth and Steenburgen), as Brad looks on in shock. There are children behaving badly and projectile vomiting babies. You get the idea.There are a few truly humorous scenes, such as a family game of Taboo, during which Brad and Kate discover that they really don't know one another that well. Performances are lively, and much of it seems improvised. The four parents are played by academy award winners Duval, Steenburgen, Spacek and Voight. While each did a respectable job, I don't think they need to figure on limousine-pooling to the Oscars next year. One of the most memorable characters is created by Chenoweth, as Kate's stressed-out big sister. After a day of quadruple Christmases, Brad and Kate will surely decide to NEVER get married and NEVER have kids. But what's that I hear? Tick . . . tick . . . tick."
30,"Brad is full of toxic masculinity and acts unbearably childish the whole time. He not once apologizes for anything, he does neither help his girlfriend cope with her anxiety nor even does as much as acknowledge it. Instead he selfishly puts himself into the spotlight arguing it was necessary for the show.
I'm usually not one to complain about a rather traditional relationship with traditional roles but this is not traditional but frankly abusive.
When she tries to talk to him about how she maybe does want to change their relationship after all he firstly ignores her and then refuses to even have that conversation, effectively denying her to have an opinion and needs.
That guy is not at all likable or even somewhat reliable. He is the impersonation of everything anyone could possibly do wrong in a relationship. He is psychologically abusive.
Sure, kate does allow him to be that way and does not question his behavior in the slightest.
But I'm not arguing someone should save that poor imaginative woman but rather for noone to ever watch this horribly written movie and god forbid never ever watch it with children who are not yet able to reflect this toxic behavior of Brad."
31,"This is essentially a propaganda piece (with two or three bits of humor, mostly in the first 15 minutes) for chicks to pressure men who will not buckle under their demands for marriage and procreation.Most of the attempts at humor are so clich√©, you've undoubtedly seen them many times before: family members who physically assault one another (with comedic intent) and vomiting babies.I left the theater feeling I had been mugged by Hollywood. Bye bye $20 and time that could have been spent doing -anything- else.Marketing strategy paid off with this one. Use ""Christmas"" in the title with big name actors and it'll make money. Substance is not necessary.What a foul, disgusting creation ""Four Christmases"" is."
32,"Vince Vaughn really needs to stop doing holiday movies. Why would anyone want to see the cynical and sarcastic comic do a Christmas movie? Considering this is his second one in as many years, someone has it in their head that holding Vaughn back in a wasted opportunity of a comedy like this is the way to go. Four Christmases does nothing to showcase the talent of both of the leads, as well as the high profile supporting cast.I found that the most annoying thing about the movie was the laziness behind it. It's a good idea for a movie, no doubt - there are many families and people that experience this exact same thing every Christmas...but how an idea so original can play out so unoriginally is beyond me. It's your typical romantic comedy that ends happily - and therein lies a problem. Our characters don't really change much from the beginning, and I was literally laughing at how clich√© it was.Vaughn and Witherspoon...well to me, it felt as if almost any actor and actress could've played the parts they played, and these were the two that the studio wanted. They certainly play off each other well - the film is no doubt funny in some parts, especially those featuring Jon Favreau, who remains awesome no matter what he does. It was nice seeing Robert Duvall in a bit of a light hearted role again as well, and Sissy Spacek was great.I'll finish my Four Christmases review in Four Paragraphs - it's a cheap, lame, formulaic, yet oddly funny comedy that will give you what you expect. It's not groundbreaking by any means, but if you want a light hearted holiday experience, Four Christmases might be what you're looking for."
33,"There are some good moments in this film - eg the family board game. But most of the time it just shows the poverty of the Hollywood comedy in the hands of all-male writers and producers (I am male and straight)who feel gross out, male fantasy, and a so-called star like Vaughn, Stiller, Ferrell, Carrey, and Rogen prattling away on an improvised in-joke script are the winning elements of cinema. Sorry, lads, you're c**p. The formula is tired, predictable, and a complete blind alley. Ms Witherspoon is always game to experiment with new genres, but she could have given this one a miss, rather than trying to rescue it two thirds of the way through with some serious acting, as she begins to wish for some normality in her character's life (indeed some of the script is a bit too close to home for the star). In fact, if you look closely at the final shot, when a terrible gag is repeated, her face shows complete boredom and disillusionment with the whole project! I can take the plot set up, the misuse of good actors, but definitely not an unfunny script and over-inflated egotistical male performances!!"
34,"This is movie is Hilarious it has now worked it way into our Family's always watch during the Holidays up there with Planes Trains and Automobiles and NL X-mas Vacation.This is Vaughn on his A-Game, in my experience, You either love or hate Vince.. I personally have been a Fan since Swingers and Made. Witherspoon is decent and holds her own, but this is Vince's Movie for sure.The scene where they visit Vaughn's Dad (the Amazing Robert Duvall) along with life long partner in crime Actor/MEGA Director Jon Favreau and the surprisingly natural actor Tim McGraw alone is worth the rental of this movie alone, and Mother Visit with Sissy Spacek and a Cameo from Swingers as her new Husband is also Fantastic.If youre not laughing out loud during these 2 scenes you dont know what Comedy is..Check this out if you wasnt to Laugh... a Fan of Vince Vaughn/Jon Favreau etc.Vaughn's performance is on point here.. just as ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""The Breakup""For some younger great VV performance's Check out ""Clay Pigeons"" and ""Domestic Disturbance"""
35,"Four Christmases is another in a long line of Hollywood comedies that rises and falls on its premise. A good comedy premise is usually based on a stark contrast that grabs the audience, creates the comic story engine and generates the laughs. The idea of this anti-Christmas movie in which a couple is forced to visit all four of their nightmare families in one day promises a laugh-filled comedy from beginning to end. But that's not what the audience gets, and the cause of the failure is embedded right in the premise.I have long pointed out that the great weakness of the ""high concept"" premise, on which much of mainstream Hollywood pictures, especially comedies, are based, is that they only give you two or three good scenes. These are the scenes where the big twist, the story flip, the stark contrast first occurs. Unfortunately a movie has anywhere from 50-70 scenes. If you don't know how to extend the premise to the full 100-120 pages, your comedy is going to die after about ten minutes.This problem with the high concept premise is exacerbated by comedy writers who think you write a good comedy by stringing together as many jokes up front as possible. The comedy dies because the writer has not created a comic structure - a comic engine - that produces the jokes organically and builds the comedy steadily to the climactic endpoint.Four Christmases exhibits both of these classic mistakes. Notice that the premise in which the couple visits four nightmarish families dictates that the contrast with the first family will produce an initial set of laughs as the audience sees the fundamental contrast for the first time. But from then on, every new visit to a family is essentially the same beat. Each subsequent family may give a slight twist to the idea, but the contrast has become old hat.Four Christmases uses another technique found in most Hollywood comedies: the writers try to string jokes for three quarters of the story and then devote the final quarter to character change. This is both unbelievable and dull. For one thing, the character change here - the couple is supposed to see the value of having a family - is the opposite of the horrific families the two encounter on their tour. For another, the change isn't set up structurally. Each time the couple gets to a new home, they are forced to have as many contrast comedy scenes as possible before moving on the next home. The couple has little time alone as they experience each new nightmare of a family. So it is a jolt when suddenly, at the end, they have a self-revelation about great it would be to start a family of their own.You can clearly see the serious flaw at the heart of the Four Christmases premise if you contrast it with Little Miss Sunshine, the best movie comedy to come along in a few years. Simply put, where Four Christmases, and most high concept comedies, are front-loaded, Little Miss Sunshine is back-loaded. Little Miss Sunshine gets funnier as the movie goes along, until the final scene at the beauty pageant when the audience is screaming with laughter. Instead of stringing a bunch of jokes together at the beginning and blowing the big contrast of the film ten minutes in, Little Miss Sunshine writer Michael Arndt creates a comic journey line that gives the audience the big contrast of the film last. They have ninety minutes to get to know the characters, with all of their weaknesses, so the comic contrast at the end has much more pop. And the character change, when it does occur, is not only believable, it happens simultaneously with the biggest laughs.If you would like to learn how to write a comedy film that builds steadily to the end, consider taking the Movie Comedy Class, or look at the Comedy Add-on to the Blockbuster software, which includes a detailed breakdown of Little Miss Sunshine. Comedy is hard, but it gets a lot easier when you know the techniques.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"
36,"I rather liked this movie to be honest,, light comic fare from Vince Vaughn,, nice touches from Reese Witherspoon, Jon Voight, and Sissy Spacek. this story is about a couple who every year avoid Christmas time and decide to take fancy exotic vacations to get away from family and all that goes with it. well this year they plan their annual trip , except for one major problem.. snowstorm,, airports are closed,, and film crews are at the airports,, so their faces are plastered all over TV so their families know that if they try and get out of Christmas visits they would be lying,, so the couple have no choice but to visit his parents,, and her parents,, four different Christmas's , this movie is full of laughs,, tender hearted moments,, and some definite awkward moments,, and a few crude ones as well.. all in all though I definitely liked this movie, as the couple get's to learn about each other and their families."
37,"This was not only the worst Christmas movie ever produced, it could possibly be the worst movie of any kind ever produced. The story is quite simple, it tells the tale of a couple that sneak away during the holiday season in order to not spend time with their respective families. Once you meet the families, you might understand the reason for their yearly exodus. The problem, however, the couple themselves have very little personality to win your heart. The jokes, if jokes they are, are stale, mean spirited, and most un-Christmas like. We would be embarrassed to have our names associated with a movie that will yearly remind movie goers that actors will do anything for a buck. There is no Christmas spirit here, please don't plan to show to a child. In fact, please don't plan to show to anybody. I would be glad to tell you that the ending had some saving grace but I cannot. I left the theater as the couple was being entertained by family number three. My wife, on the other hand, remained to the bitter end, not one to waste the money for a partially seen movie. According to her critique of the ending, she wishes she would have. Leaving when I did was one of the best gifts I received for this holiday. To be fair, I'll admit, there was one moment, one scene, when I laughed. Conceding that, there were two enjoyable moments in Four Christmases, that scene and the leaving early."
38,"While we were watching this movie, and Lord knows it was God awful, we noticed in several scenes later in the movie, that Reese Witherspoon had a body double in several scenes. After watching it, it was obvious it was not the real Reese Witherspoon. Different facial expressions and different hair, absolutely was not Resse Witherspoon. I am ashamed I wasted over an hour with this non funny attempt at humor. Terrible says it best. It starts off with this lovey dovey mess where they spend all their time telling people how great not being married is, how wonderful it is to live without kids. They progress on to telling a story to others on how good it is not to be married. From there they lose a flight and have to spend time at their 4 parents for a Christmas with each one of them. It has two or three funny lines in the whole movie. Reese Witherspoon having an acting double in several scenes, made the movie that much worse. It was so obvious."
39,"This film was a bitter disappointment. Not even the usually wonderful Reese Witherspoon could save this holiday turkey. Vince Vaughn was his usual self: nauseating and ham-fisted, and had zero chemistry with his co-star. To be fair, neither Vaughn nor Witherspoon had a lot to work with, script-wise. The opening scene is crude and strange, and seems very out of place in what is being marketed as a ""holiday movie"". The closing scene just rehashes one of the main opening jokes. The remaining middle of the film is a mess of crude, Farrelly Brothers type ""humor"" mixed with hokey sentiment. I found the church scene particularly offensive and I'm not especially religious. I'd hate to think how offensive other viewers may have found it. Not even cameos by Jon Voight and Sissy Spacek could save this film. I don't think I've been as bitterly disappointed by a movie since ""Wedding Crashers""(which I walked out of - I wish I'd had the sense to do that with this movie!) There are a wealth of really wonderful holiday movies - this isn't one of them. Please save your $$ and go out and rent a tried and true holiday classic and stay away from this utter turkey."
40,"My husband and I saw this movie Thanksgiving night. We had high hopes since Reese, Vince and a lot of other big names were in this movie. Well, we rated it a one(1) and we are being generous. It is awful.My husband said ""Mistletoe"" to me(you'll get it if you saw the movie, and we almost left the theater a few times during the movie but wanted to give it a chance. It is really bad. Our local paper rated it a 1 1/2 out of 5 and we should have listened. Don't waste your time and money on this holiday movie and definitely don't bring your children. It is vulgar in several places, disrespectful to Christianity and simply not funny. There isn't any chemistry between Reese and Vince. The scenes are overplayed and there is a sense of desperation to make you laugh; which you don't....like when Grandma makes her comment about pleasing her husband. Most of all, it leaves you with an uncomfortable feeling when you leave the movie, not upbeat at all. My husband and I were talking on the way home and we felt like we witnessed an embarrassing and hurtful family gathering, a dysfunctional and mean-spirited family getting together for Christmas with no resolution and no closure. You are left hanging with these uncomfortable feelings and this isn't what a good holiday movie is supposed to be about. Bottom line, save your money and time and watch a rerun of ""Its A Wonderful Life"" or better yet, ""A Christmas Carol"" but only the one starring Alistair Sim, the 1958 version."
41,"Even a stellar cast can't do anything for this horrible mess. It may be The Fokkers At Christmas but it plays out like a damp squib.With four families to visit, ranging from mad Southern white trash (Oh so hilarious) to horny mothers and even weirder churches this just about misses every target it sets up by a mile.It is not even funny embarrassing, it just ain't funny.Given all the amazing talent on show here something good out to have come out of this - preferably the shooting of the script editors - but nope, absolutely horrible.Reeks of the taste of two week old turkey...."
42,"I had mediocre expectations for this film, hoping that it would exceed them...no such luck. While Vince Vaughn does get me to chuckle on occasion, he couldn't seem to do it in this movie. I actually found myself sighing at times because I was apparently expected to laugh at so many gags which weren't funny.The script was lazy. It's almost like the producers didn't really have any idea what sort of film they wanted to make when they started, they just pieced it together as they went and hoped it was funny. There is absolutely zero chemistry between Witherspoon and Vaughn. My wife explained to me that there was some conflict between the two on the set due to the differences in their approaches; this was clear in the film. It looks as though Vaughn is just on a continuous rant, and Witherspoon doesn't know what to say half of the time. These two were just not right for each other.I don't understand why there were so many Oscar-winning actors in this film--Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, John Voight, Mary Steenburgen. Did the screenplay really seem that funny? These actors may have had thirty lines between them. And why did Carol Kane even bother showing up for this project? When I first saw her, I fully expected her to play a pivotal role. I can't remember her saying a single line. Surely, her 'speaking' scenes had to have been cut for some reason. Have times really been so tough that she had to take a non-speaking role? Then again, if you had to be in his movie, maybe that was the best strategy.Hollywood: If you feel you have to shock the audience to keep their attention, try something creative...we're not amused by telling a small child there is no Santa Claus. I didn't hear a single laugh from the opening day audience in the packed theatre on this joke. In fact, I only heard the same five or six women laughing at any joke. Obvious Vaughn devotees.Bottom line: wait for the DVD"
43,"Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Brad (Vince Vaughn) are a typical ""modern"" couple. Professionals in the San Fran area, they are determined to hold off on marriage, for co-habitation suits them just fine, and they certainly don't want kids. For starters, they each have relatives who seem to indicate that their gene pools are flawed. Therefore, for the last several years, they have avoided getting together with ""the family"" over Christmas, jetting off to exotic locales instead. To make it work, they tell their parents they are performing acts of humanitarianism in far off places, such as distributing food and water to the poor. But, alas! Although their destination this year is Fiji, a thick fog grounds all planes in Frisco and, unfortunately, a news reporter blasts their photos and plans over the tube. Busted, the young twosome have no recourse but to visit their relations. First up is Brad's father (Robert Duvall), who lives near the desert, where they will also meet with Brad's eccentric brothers (one is Tim McGraw) and their families. From choke holds to cheese whiz snacks, this proves a wonderful sharing time. Then, its on to Kate's mother's (Mary Steenburgen) house, with other happily deranged siblings (Kristin Chenowith is one) and a trip to the newfangled church run by Pastor Kevin (Dwight Yoakum). Nearing a place where they begin to pull out their own hair, will Kate and Brad make it through a journey to Brad's hippie mother's abode (Sissy Spacek)and Kate's distant father's mansion (Jon Voight)? Here is a ""fourmulaic"" film that draws heavily from other movies, such as National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, but still ends up being fun. This is mostly due to the terrific cast, as all of the performers mentioned above due great work with limited material. Especially noteworthy are Witherspoon and Vaughn, for their comic talents are so large that it would be difficult to see any other actors doing these roles as well. The scenery is a mixture of lovely city sights and rustic holes in the wall, while the costumes are quite nice and the photography just fine, also. Although the script has its moments, it also sports some banalities so it is good that the direction never lags. All in all, if you are a fan of the two stars or you are in the mood for a ""feel-good"" holiday movie, with no heaviness, this is a nice selection. Although it is lighter than a soap bubble, it still has its charms to soothe the savage beast in all of us."
44,"This dreary movie feels like a scriptwriting committee had a nice brainstorming session, and then transferred it all directly to screen -- without anybody checking whether any of the ideas were funny, interesting, or made any sense.Part of this movie's problem is its incoherence. The movie's whole premise hinges on the airport being wrapped in fog so thick that no planes can possibly take off all day. Pea soup fog! Everywhere! Making national news! The entire remainder of the movie then fails to contain any fog. Apparently this Fog of Damocles hangs only over the airport, leaving the sun free to shine everywhere else. And so it goes, a string of strained premises, incoherent segues, and eye-rollingly predictable outcomes. The movie's sequence of events, which I will generously call a ""plot"" for the sake of discussion, serve only as a meager vehicle for the lame jokes.This can, of course, be just fine. For example, the ludicrous and incoherent plot of ""Airplane"" works because the movie knows how ridiculous it is. The second major problem with ""Four Christmases"" is that it takes itself seriously. It tries, genuinely tries, to deal with serious issues -- about conflicting desires in relationships, changing cultural expectations about marriage and family, and the importance of family in spite of personal differences. It fails miserably. Its treatment of these issues manages to be simultaneously predictable, tone-deaf, and mildly offensive.The offensiveness is the movie's third major problem. I'm not easily offended. Language? Sexuality? Violence? All fine if they serve to tell a good story. No, I mean the people themselves in the movie are offensive: mean-spirited, shallow, unlikeable, offensive people. As the movie grinds along, I don't find myself rooting for anyone -- or loving to hate anyone, for that matter. No, mostly I find myself wishing that I will never, ever have to interact with anybody like any of these characters.The movie's fourth and largest problem, however, is that the vast majority of the jokes simply aren't funny. Watching the movie is like having a drunken stranger at a bar telling you an endless stream of idiotic jokes, each of which elicits only a blank stare from you, all the while breathing rum and cigarette in your face. You want to leave, but you're afraid they'll follow you home. You want to tell them to shut up, but you'll afraid they'll punch you. So you sit, glare, and nod your head, hoping it will end soon. That's what this movie is like.I gave it three stars because there were two or three lines that were actually funny buried in there somewhere (though I can't remember now what they were), because the camera, set, and costume work was entirely competent -- and because, let's face it, this movie just ain't ""Manos: Hands of Fate."""
45,"It could have been a good movie but so many of the jokes seemed to be written by 12 year old. I found the jokes to be to childish to be funny. Stringing together crude or stupid jokes do not make a movie. If your looking for a movie to skip this is the one. Some of the actors were completely wasted. It was sad to see the flat characters. Many were propped up by bad jokes. Really good actors wasted. Why did this make it to film? Because the leads were picked to keep it from falling flat. Try something else. My wife and I were the only people in the theater. It should have shown what we were getting into but I thought having the whole theater to ourselves would be very nice for once. No phones going off, no baby or children in an adult movie, no jerk talking all the way through. I was wrong it was not worth it."
46,"I can't help but to chuckle at how Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) got busted on national television no less, for having everyone whom they have lied to, see exactly where they are - at the airport trying to get to their vacation destination rather than accepting the invitation from their families to spend the season's greetings with. After all, as far as Brad's mantra goes, you can't have families without ""lies"". Anyway it is a situation that I'm fairly familiar with, and his reaction when the television camera gets poked in his face, brought back the memory of my own busted moment many years back.As the wafer thin story goes, here is a couple who have spent the last three years in their ""honeymoon"" period, where everything is fine and dandy, and they seem to be A-OK with their commitment-less agreement and enjoying life as it is with each other. But a fog-ruined holiday meant they have to spend their one-day delay in San Francisco, and play tote the politically correct line in visiting all their divorced parents - that makes it four pit stops to commemorate the festivities, and hence the title - and this led to various inevitable hilarious situations.Such as revisiting the ghosts and skeletons hidden in the homes they each grew up in, and for the first time, for both Brad and Kate to really discover who they once were, and who they are now, warts and all, for the other party to see. In fact, the first two house visits did just that, in presenting their worst nightmares and their attempts to overcome them. Sounds clich√© I know, but that's the gist you get from the entire movie, that it's nothing more than a generic holiday movie where things that can go awry, do.Given that it's a compact under 90 minute film, you'd come to expect that the latter half of the visits suffered from haphazard editing in order to make a mad dash to the finale. And this tells from the way characters magically appear one moment, and disappear the next. Reese Whiterspoon just pales herself against the gigantic Vince Vaughn, and it's quite a curious case of what the filmmakers actually had in mind in casting a really tall Vaughn against a really short Witherspoon, that you can check out those heels she had to deck just to reach his erm, armpits. Vaughn definitely stole her thunder here (in what was reel reflecting real - you just got to love his rendition of Joseph) although some of the usual wisecracks did get toned down, and he seemed to be muted for the most parts, instead of being able to run riot with the role. Perhaps the much publicized tiff with his co-star did take its toil after all?Four Christmases doesn't offer any gifts to the audience, and you're likely to stay one step ahead of the characters all the time. Genuinely funny jokes are rare, and moments of contemplation on the greater good gets mentioned only fleetingly. It's still quite amazing though that the film managed to get on board as supporting characters, the likes of Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen, Kristin Chenoweth, Tim McGraw (!) and even the director of Iron Man Jon Favreau! So it's enjoy the moment with the supporting characters (almost all of whom their characters seem a little sexed up), in what would be a rather plain film."
47,"Four Christmases (2008) ** 1/2 (out of 4) It's hard to believe that a comedy like this would feature five Academy Award winners but that's the case and the end results aren't as bad as some critics made them appear. Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn play the perfect couple who enjoy their lives together, which doesn't include their family. After a lie they've been telling is blown, they're forced to visit all four of their divorced parents in one day. This comedy is certainly as light weight as they come but the terrific cast makes it worth watching even though you'll still be scratching your head wondering how so many Oscar-winners ended up in one film. You have Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight and Mary Steenburgen playing all the parents but you also have famous faces like Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw and Dwight Yoakam filling out supporting roles. With all these famous faces you can't help but stay mildly entertained throughout the rather short 89-minute running time. The jokes are all rather childish but this is a family comedy after all. We get several jokes with Witherspoon not liking children yet having to hold them only to get screamed at or puked on. We have other small jokes like Vaughn's brothers being wannabe wrestlers. We get jokes dealing with showing pictures that all parents show to embarrass their kids. Some of the humor is a darker, sexual related but it all gets minor laughs. There's certainly nothing here that's going to make you fall on the ground laughing but if you enjoy cheap humor then you'll certainly want to check it out. The cast has Vaughn leading the way giving his best Vaughn performance that only Vaughn could give. Witherspoon once again proves to be better than the material at hand, which is something happening quite a bit. Spacek and Voight doesn't get too much screen time but Duvall ends up with a pretty good role as the redneck dad. Again, this isn't the greatest comedy in the world and I'm sure it'll soon be forgotten but if you have a Redbox near you then it's certainly worth a dollar."
48,"I feel like I've seen this type of movie before, ""Meet the Parents"" comes in mind. I don't really like Vince and Reese together, I didn't think that they have the greatest chemistry as a couple. In some ways it was cute and in other ways I just felt that it was overdone. It was just a one time movie for me. I wouldn't want to re-watch it.I just felt disappointed by this movie, because I feel like it would have been a cute and funny movie and it just wasn't. And Reese wasn't as charming in this movie as in her previous movie. In this one she just acted very bland. I think its just because she didn't really have much chemistry with Vince. Save your money, get it on rental when it comes out on DVD."
49,"Four Christmases is stupid and there's maybe one laugh in the whole movie and it might not even have been intentional we're still arguing over that. I still can't figure out why it is that Vince Vaughn is a movie star when all he does is the same sarcastic/smug act and he's not that funny and he's not good looking either, he's always the same character and I am not entertained by him at all. I liked him in Dodgeball but that was pretty much it. I am a big fan of her though so I can't stand seeing her in this movie. I hoped it would be really good but it looks at Vince Vaughn's character too much and it really is just a series of poor jokes and gags, the characters are too dimensional and the movie doesn't even have much to do with Christmas."
50,"Now, there are some bad Christmas films,but this one was better than I expected and I was in the mood to see a bad film. But I was surprised. The characters of Kate and brad had some good chemistry with some screamingly funny lines:the opening sequence,the dance class etc., and their families,through a bit over the top,are great. The film goes for mushy predictability by the end but it was fun. Now,it will not be a big memory when leaving the theater but it stands out amongst the group of famously terrible Christmas films. So if you want to kill an hour and a half with a supply of laughs,it's what you might like. Give it a try."
51,"Any movie with Reese Witherspoon, you think is going to be some cute film with some laughs. Well, this isn't funny unless you find a baby vomiting milk on someone hilarious. As a matter of fact, Kate and Brad are rather oblivious to their families. When they visit, the parents say they haven't seen them in years. And apparently they live in the same area since they drive to all 4 homes in a day. They don't seem like grateful kids. The only person I liked was Sissy Spacek as Brad's mom. Her hitting the buzzer because she didn't understand the game was amusing.Also the plot wasn't that good. Like Kate and Brad come to this understanding about their relationship in a day, then it flashes to a year later and they have a baby.FINAL VERDICT: Not worth your time."
52,Romantic comedies are just going downhill these days. It's disgraceful for me to see this top the box office when it's not only lacking humor but completely lacking any moral fiber.Vince Vaughn tries to pull of some comedy with his typical rants but honestly they just don't work. This movie brings nothing new or original and relies on humor from situations we've seen over and over again now.If it were a cheery Christmas movie then at least it could pass as a decent family movie but that's all ruined within the first five minutes.
53,"i wrote up my review on my site. it can be found here http://www.thejonnyfilm.com/theaters/2008/12/8/four-christmases.html there are spoilers in the article thoughi'm bummed because the film in no way felt like Christmas. here's a quick excerpt from the reviewJon Favreau is awesome as Vince estranged brother, a trained UFC fighter, who rules the Taboo circuit. but almost everyone else, Robert Duval, Sissy Spacek, mary steenburgen, and Dwight Yoakam is completely wasted.the movie's not terrible, it just...whatever. i laughed. not hard. i'm not sure this is either here nor there but the part that effected me the most was a scene where Reeses family discuss her youth and keep hammering home how fat she was. they accomplish this by showing pictures of actual little girls, who are supposed to be ""baby reese"" but are really just fat little girls being made fun of in front of a national audience. i'm not above making fun of people, but something felt just mean about it."
54,I love all these negative reviews by morons. This is a comedy and attended to just be stupid humor. People make such negative comments. Guess they are expecting the God Father.
55,Reese Witherspoon should be a shamed of her horrible perform in this movie.Everybody in this movie were phoning in their performance even the babies. Even the babies!!!There was a scene where Vince and Reese were smiling together. Those were the fakest smiles I've ever seen. The jokes just flat and flaccid just like Reese Witherspoon.Do not watch this movie.
56,"This was schlocky drivel. There was a rumor that Vince Vaughn & Reese Witherspoon did not get along during filming. I don't know if that's been verified or not but it wouldn't surprise me because there's very little chemistry between the two of them and this movie really lacked heart and warmth.I go hot and cold with Vince Vaughn. Sometimes his shtick is really funny and then other times he's just annoying. He doesn't seem to be able to play anybody different than someone who yammers on non-stop. It gets irritating after awhile. He's basically one note.Reese is a good actress but she's really not given much to act with here. She just seemed like she was sedated throughout this film.Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Dwight Yoakam, Tim McGraw, John Favre & Kristen Chenoweth are wasted in this.The bouncy house scene was so stupid. Adults just don't go into a bouncy house where kids just start going MMA on them. All she would've had to do is to tell the little girl to give her the pregnancy stick and be done with it. I hate it when they try to make these things so over the top-it's ridiculous, cringeworthy and stupid.Finally I am married with a child-however I hate the message of this movie which seems to be trying to insinuate that the childless or not married cannot possibly be fulfilled or have meaningful lives. There are lots of people that are in committed relationships that are not married and don't have kids that manage to have meaningful fulfilling lives. I really don't like it when movies try to portray these people as soulless sadsacks on the outer edges especially when the divorce rate is so high. Just because you choose to go the traditional route does not guarantee a successful positive outcome. Kids are a lot of work and oftentimes bring a lot of stress to already fragile marriages and relationships. Those that are mature enough and intelligent enough to recognize that kids are a big responsibility and sometimes a hindrance should be commended for their self-awareness. There's nothing wrong with realizing that kids are not something that would fit into one's lifestyle or that one just doesn't have a desire for. There are all kinds of different ways that people have families. It doesn't have to be the traditional ""everybody's married with kids"" thing because usually most people that are married with kids are miserable. And again this comes from someone who is very happily married with a child that I love dearly. I just don't think we should marginalize those people who make different choices than the traditional roles. Clearly tradition has shown us that it doesn't always work best.This was a movie the world could have done without. It was truly nothing special and a waste of money and talent.Skip this and make your own positive Christmas memories."
57,Vince and reese put in solid performances and plot is ok but - it really doesn't have any heart and it is a shouty film. If you are looking for a Christmas film go and watch almost Christmas or family man.
58,A lot of serious reviews. This film is a light hearted poke at a Christmas film with a great cast. If you want a film you can have on and smile at then this is for you
59,"This movie annoys me so much every time I watch it, but I still watch it every year. I really hate all the people fighting in this film and the plot is kind of odd. What saves this movie is Vince Vaughn and his fast talking ramblings. Also if you stay to the end you will hear a Tom Petty Christmas classic."
60,"Four Christmases attempts to be a humorous heartwarming holiday movie about modern-day scrooges, but it ends up being too negative for its own good. The predictable ""lesson learned"" ending seems too short and tacked on. There were some funny moments, but I don't think I'll watch this one again."
61,"A festive holiday explanation of why terrible people have extend their terrible tendencies to then have (probably) terrible children. Other than a couple of funny Vaughn moments (which are nearly as rare as a Santa sighting here), I hated every single moment and non-authentic character in this angry, cynical, mean-spirited, nonsensical, and stupid Christmas cash grab. And as much as I love a good take down of the Evangelical church, that scene is offensive and unfunny in every way possible...I guess it fits right in."
62,"The beginning you would think could lead to a funny modern family movie. Not this time.There is not much too say really,a very unoriginal script,fancy and refurbished actors,unrealistic settings...and I could go on.This is just a mediocre holiday movie,that if on TV is worth a watch,but not necessary. Some may find it similar to the Focker's or Meet the parents,but not nearly as hilarious. There are a lot more better and funnier Christmas movies out there,even if you have already seen them before.My rate is a low 4,maybe 5 on a snowy day."
63,"Christmas eve and seemingly happy couple Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reece Witherspoon) are at the airport on their way to Fiji to avoid their families over the holiday period, when weather conditions scupper their getaway and are forced to visit each of the divorced parents houses on Christmas day. Unfortunately for a movie called four Christmases apart from the opening 15 minutes when they are at a work Christmas party i felt there isn't much of a Christmas feel about it. I've liked Vince Vaughn since Swingers, which is a fantastic film, but lately he has been doing the same thing in all his is in and with his latest efforts has been struggling. The leads do not make a convincing couple with no real chemistry between them with the main laughs coming from the smaller roles. There are some good comedic moments and its worth a watch as long as you don't expect too much, but when there are so many better Christmas comedies out there I would rather watch one of them.I give this movie 2 out of 5."
64,"Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, and a ton of Oscar winners star in Four Christmases. Perhaps I am a tad too late to review this one also. But it took me this long to watch it. So that is clearly why I am late reviewing it. How can you review a film that you haven't seen? I'll tell you how... you can't.Like a lot of Vince Vaughn comedies, Four Christmases has obvious humor. Baby barf, people getting hit in the balls(that one is just an example). I must say this though. Though I haven't seen Couples retreat, this is the best Vince Vaughn comedy since The Break up in 2006. That movie wasn't art. Though neither is this one, they're both pretty humorous.Vaughn and Witherspoon star as an unhappy-like couple named Brad and Kate. Each year, they lie to their parents to get out of visiting them. They come up with some ridiculous excuse, and take a nice vacation. Until on one Christmas, all of the flights are cancelled, and all of their divorced parents see them on the news. So, the couple is forced to visit all four homes in one day. And you understand why they try to blow them off each Christmas.The film has a great cast. Including Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voigt, Sissy Spacek, and Robert Duvall. The movie has hit and miss humor. A lot of hit, but some of ti is miss. Jon Faverau stars and is absolutely stupid. Also, the parents may get under your skin. Because they got under mine a little bit. Of course the movie has cheap gags. It's a Vince Vaughn film for God's sake. Considering that I haven't seen the new Christmas carol(Oh I really want to), Four Christmases is the best Christmas film in a long time. The movie ain't art. I don't think that anything Vince Vaughn is in will ever be art. Everyone else though... well, they have already done that.Four Christmases:**1/2 out of ****"
65,"An Average comedy that felt way too much like Meet the Parents and Just Married. Sadly they showed most of the funny scenes on the trailers. A constant thing showing up in movies. The best part of watching this was the hilarious Yes Man trailer before the movie.There were some scenes that had me laughing out loud but there just wasn't enough to satisfy a comedy lover. Jon Favreau stole the show. I didn't know Favreau was going to be in this but was pleasantly surprised. I loved him with everything his done, Starring in Friends and doing a great job on Iron Man.I don't recommend this. It's a total waste of money and should only be rented. I give Four Christmases(or Four Holidays).....4/10"
66,"Vince Vaughn is in another Christmas movie since Fred Claus(2007), but unlike that movie, Four Christmases mainly goes for zany sight gags, and edgy humor, but not enough to get an R rating. It's funny, but don't count on it being just another warm holiday comedy, like The Santa Claus trilogy, Elf(2003), and Fred Claus(2007).The film centers around Brad(Vince Vaughn) and Kate(Reese Witherspoon), a happy go lucky couple, both have parents who are divorced, and during the holidays, Brad and Kate avoid there families at all cost, by coming up with a series of lies, and taking a trip to Fiji, but there lies soon catch up to them, when there flight has been canceled, and they both end up on T.V., for there families to see. They both realize that too make right, they half to visit all four families in one day, but will there relationship make it before Christmas ends? Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon are quite a funny pair, they play off each other so well. Vince Vaughn once again shows his perfection for comic timing, his long funny sentences, are quite funny and charming. Reese Witherspoons funny reactions to things and situations are also very funny. It's funny, but not the greatest of all comedies, cause some of the jokes are few and far between. The supporting cast are enjoyable, like Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Mary Steemburgin, and John Voight. It was amusing, but that is all."
67,"I originally had no intention of seeing this file at all; especially since Fred Claus felt like a lump of coal in my proverbial stocking. But I'm glad I did. I agree with some comments about it lacking Christmas spirit but seeing as how I'm a big Scrooge at heart, that's one of the reasons why I loved it. I laughed a lot at the darkness of their anti-Christmas humor.The shining light in this film is Vince Vaughn himself who's fast talking wit is incredible. Like in Wedding Crashers (a fav of mine), he's mouths off a million words a minute. It's hilarious. Vince's on screen family is a total crack up with the whole MMA fighting and spray cheese. Love it.Reese Witherspoon never disappoints either she's got the personality to keep Vince on his toes. Snappy and smart.Don't go into this one looking for heartwarming, yuletide cheer, but if you want a good laugh at some crazy characters and snappy dialog then this is the one to see."
68,"'Four Christmases' is a tad different from the usual boring Christmas flick. Much of the humour works thanks to the stellar cast that includes, Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughn, Robert Duvall, Jon Favreau, Katey Mixon, Tim McGraw, Kristin Chenoweth, Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight and Sissy Spacek. The producers probably thought, ah, lets get a bunch of A list actors and we'll have a holiday hit. Vince Vaughn plays the goofy dude that used to be fun to watch but now he's whinier and it's getting a little old. I wonder why Witherspoon chose this movie. She appears just as whiny as co-star Vaugn. Yet, in spite of having such a stellar cast, 'Four Christmases' is mainly let down by poor writing. The characters and story lack development. The film itself uses a too many comedic clich√©s. Morover this was released about the same time as the far superior 'Nothing Like The Holidays' and it is bound to be forgotten over the years to come. I'd say at most it's only worth a one-time watch (mainly because of the cast)."
69,"I enjoyed 'Four Christmases', even if it does gradually drop in quality throughout.I found the premise and set-up of it entertaining, the execution may not be perfect but it leads to a satisfactory Xmas comedy. The plot does get slightly repetitive, but there's enough in there to keep it watchable. They also, smartly, keep the run time low at 88 minutes.Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon are a fun pairing, I felt the necessary chemistry between the two. Elsewhere, the likes of Robert Duvall, Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen and Jon Favreau all make noteworthy appearances.It's good. If it kept up the strong start then I'd be rating it a tad higher."
70,"I don't expect much from Christmas movies, and this one had pretty dumb and dumber humor (which is not my kind of humor, but to echt their own), but whhhhyyyy are people who chose to live childfree always portrayed as shallow and self absorbed? or as in J-Lo's Second Act have a trauma that causes them to avoid the subject but deep down she really does want to become a mother.There are couples out there who do not want children and have a fulfilling and happy life. And it would have been more believable that the Brad and Kate decide they want children amd what not if their families were actually nice and loveable! But they are horrible!This movie just annoyed me...."
71,"I love this movie so much. It's so funny a d very relatable. Sometimes being with families during the holidays can be the worst. I love both Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon and then though there were rumors that they didn't get along. The fact that they pulled this off, shows they are professionals. Recommend."
72,"A funny and heartwarming little christmas flick, Four Christmases may suffer from moving into dramatic territory too soon too fast, but it has enough funny moments and gags to keep you satisfied along the way. First off I want to recognize Vince Vaughn, who truly puts his all into his performance. His comedic talents are truly unrecognized, and he always gives the role all he can, no matter what film. Him and Reese Witherspoon play a terrific pair throughout the film, even with rumours of them apparently not getting along on set. The cast is big and fun, from Jon Favreau to Jon Voight, and Mary Steenburgen to Sissy Spacek. I particularly liked Favreau performance as Vaughn's character's brother, as he stole the scene every time. The film is a bit uneven at times with its dramatic counterparts, trying to find a point and eventually a conclusion to this irregular christmas tale, but when it finally figures out its pacing, it proves to be really sweet, and something I wouldn't mind watching around the holiday more often. In the end, Four Christmases is a fun little christmas flick that really harnesses its talent and provides for some truly funny little moments.
My Rating: 8/10"
73,"I'm dumbfounded by the horrible reviews for this movie and the below 6/10 rating. Four Christmases is a funny movie to watch during the Christmas season which delivers a pretty good message: intentionally childless, entertainment focused, urban couples aren't the best at appreciating the struggles and joys of family, yet their avoidance from such a lifestyle doesn't itself meet anticipated fulfillment. You'll be disappointed if you'd expected a romantic comedy, for Vince Vaughn to star in a lead role yet somehow not act in his usual fashion, or something your toddler would enjoy. Instead, you'll get light-blue comedy one-liners, and ridiculous situational comedy."
74,"The premise has the capacity to be a Christmas Classic but between the few really funny moments there's a lot of draggy, not so funny ones, Considering the movie runs at less than 90 minutes they pack a lot in and scenes that are dragged out like Reese contemplating near the end - and others- they could have packed more humour especially with Vince Vaughn who will go there. Misses the mark."
75,"12 December 2008. This movie doesn't know how to successfully blend comedy and drama and uses some pretty intense mean scenes that bordered on cruelty not dumb humor. Within the plot and script there were opportunities for some rather brilliant enlightening scenes, but they were mostly passed over quickly. The ending however was rather good, having the nice touch (however traditional) of nicely tying the beginning and ending together. Many of the characters were not very sympathetic and more outrageous caricatures than likable, funny people that the audience could attach to. The balance was off and wavered. Overall the movie started off balanced, stabilized rather startlingly well, then moved onward with some snapping dialogue and promise but then descended into slapstick and pratfalls that didn't seem to mess with the underlying more deeply moving themes. Five out of Ten Stars."
76,"... and I have no idea why. This is one of dozens of holiday films made over the last twenty years, and I don't get quite why that is true when Hollywood makes fewer films overall than they did in studio days before TV, yet there is a glut of these kinds of films versus the 30s through the 70s.It is completely predictable in its outcome. And that doesn't mean the fun is in the journey either because that is paint by numbers too. What you have is a yuppie couple played by Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon who spend every Christmas on Fiji to avoid their dysfunctional families, but this year they are fogged in and stuck at home. A news crew interviewing them alerts their families to their availability and so they are forced to trudge to ""four Christmases"" since every parent is divorced and having their own Christmas. Both moms are oversexed in spite of being postmenopausal. Vaughn's dad is a lonely old man. Well, I should say he is a man alone because he seems quite happy in his solitary hermit existence.And in spite of the fact that the first three of these four gatherings are disasters, Witherspoon reveals to Vaughn that she probably does want to get married, that she does want to have kids. Vaughn quips that if anything should say they were right in traveling light through life it was the disaster that was today.I could say watch and find out what happens, but 98% of you will write the ending that happened without even seeing it.Why does Hollywood make these kinds of movies in the modern era? Maybe to make people feel better about themselves because their families couldn't possibly be this outrageous? To say ""Everyone else procreated and it was a disaster and so should I""? Maybe just because a sloppy script with cliched plot devices and Christmas lights pack them in during the Holidays and after all, isn't that the point?You won't be the worse for watching this because I guarantee you've seen it before under a different name, but I wouldn't seek it out if you can find a better film to watch."
77,"An amiable if not outright funny Christmas-themed comedy with Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn as an unmarried long-term couple so set in their ways that they role-play nights out in bars to add spice to their relationship. This scene is probably the closest to laugh-out-loud funny in the whole movie as we move on to discover that their four mutually estranged parents are apparently so awful that they'll contrive imaginary charitable holidays to avoid meeting up with them. En route to an exotic holiday to Fiji, their ruse is busted when the flight is cancelled, they're caught off-guard in a TV news piece and inadvertently beamed into the homes of their families who all wonder why they never get to see them over the holidays. Shamed into the Christmas spirit, they make the rounds of their four crazy parents, well, three of them anyway before broody ideas hit Witherspoon's as she finds herself interacting with a succession of babies and infants. Vaughn of course doesn't want to give up their carefree child-free lifestyles but there are no prizes for guessing what makes up the happy ending.Obviously taking ""Meet The Parents"" as a major reference point, the film mostly manages to avoid crassness (apart from an episode where Witherspoon tries to get back a stolen pregnancy test from her young niece). There are amusing scenes where the hapless couple get roped into playing Mary and Joseph at a school nativity play and participate in a truth-telling board game.Vaughn and Witherspoon play well together and there's lots of celebrity support with Robert Duval impersonating De Niro's latter-day elderly curmudgeon schtick, Mary Steenbergen as a born-again yummy mummy although Sissy Spacek seems miscast as Vaughn's mother who's taken in her son's best pal as her live-in lover.The ending, where the duo apparently find the true meaning and happiness missing in their relationship by eventually having a kid of their own seems to cock an uncharitable snook at other couples who either can't or don't want to have children in their relationships but I'll chalk that one down to holiday sentimentality.""Four Christmases"" won't go down as an enduring Christmas classic, but with lots of Christmas decorations around and a variable quality soundtrack (Bing Crosby crooning ""White Christmas"" to a disco beat at the start of the film is a definite no-no) I found it a pleasant enough diversion this particular December as the big day approaches this year."
78,"This happened to be on Film 4 last night. And since there was nothing to look at on TV I decided to give this movie a go since I have never seen it before. The film is about an unmarried couple named Brad and Kate(played by Just Like Heaven's Reese Witherspoon and Dodgeball's Vince Vaughan)and they met at a night's out during the Christmas period. Of course they dream to go to Fiji together but since there was a fog,all the destinations were cancelled including Fiji so the couple decide to celebrate Xmas with their extended families by trying to go to both set of parents(as both of their parents are divorced) So will they go to Fiji and can they stick both set of their parents during the Xmas season?Now I just watched this like I said last night because I am a fan of both Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughan I liked Vince in Dodgeball I thought that was hilarious and Reese in Walk The Line,but they seemed very aloof on screen,I can't put my finger on it but they were very distant and cold with each other it just didn't work at all. Granted if the actors were getting along it would have been better but that was the major problem with this movie. The backgrounds were nice in fairness but the movie as a whole was just a so so movie.Average"
79,"Directed by Seth Gordon, ""Four Christmases"" stars Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn as a couple who visit the homes of four relatives during the Christmas holidays. As these relatives as ""quirky"", much hilarity ensues.When it's attempting to be ""dramatic"", ""touching"" and ""sweet"", ""Four Christmases"" is mostly inept. When it's attempting to put forth a message ‚Äì our lead characters teach us the importance of marriage and procreation - the film is even worse. Elevating things slightly are some funny moments by actor Vince Vaughn, whose improvisations and dead-pan ramblings help breakup Gordon's formulaic script. Jon Favreau steals the show as Vaughn's bizarre sibling.5/10 ‚Äì Worth one viewing."
80,"FOUR CHRISTMASES would be nothing without Jon Favreau dry-humping Vince Vaughn's twisted arm. Best part of the movie. I laughed out loud. Then the movie kept going. Unfortunately.In this uneven comedy, Brad (Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are a boisterous, adventurous young couple who studiously avoid visiting their dysfunctional families every Christmas, opting to take wild vacations - and lie to their families that they are instead doing volunteer work for underprivileged kids overseas. This year, they get busted, and must visit all four of their divorced parents (and extended families) in one day.Now if this were a wonders-of-Christmas movie, it would be bilious enough, but FOUR CHRISTMASES combines the nausea of a Christmas movie with the gut-belching dementia of a marriage-is-awesome movie. Ultimately, Christmas is just a device to drive the unmarried couple into the cloying proximity of family and married life. And to discover the wonders therein. Cue shining rainbows and angels singing.At first, the couple resist the insidious madness. In Brad's words, ""You can't spell families without lies."" We soon learn he picked up that axiom from his cantankerous dad (Robert Duvall - like Favreau, could carry the movie on his wild boar performance alone!). Brad and Kate have no desire to tie the knot and end up like their dissatisfied and divorced parents. But this movie doesn't leave well enough alone and allow Brad and Kate their fun-loving life of taking impromptu dance lessons or role-playing picking each other up in bars. In the process of visiting their varied families, they come to realize truths about each other and - so the movie tells us - how dysfunctional THEY are for not wanting to end up married! (Nuance: It may be missed by the Great Unwashed, but the message of the movie is not EXACTLY ""to be married"" but to ""be together,"" which is tantamount to marriage, in gutless modern pc parlance.) I spit on this movie's message! Written by - surprisingly - four guys (Matt Allen, Caleb Wilson, Jon Lucas and Scott Moore) and directed by Seth Gordon, all of whom we can be sure have been pussywhipped into marriage and are now suffering cognitive dissonance, as they promote ""married bliss"" even whilst showing us every parent in the movie unhappily divorced! To top it all off: disrespectful, unruly kids! Every child in this movie is a brawling, loudmouth brat that deserves to be abandoned in a parking lot. Yet the cognitive dissonance in full swing: Kate gets all swoozy with the desire to have kids after being browbeaten and physically beaten by them. I spit again! Ptuh! Like Mighty Mouse, Jon Favreau saves the day. Favreau is Denver, one of Brad's thick-necked brothers, a tattooed, redneck wrestler who takes every opportunity to bodyslam Orlando (Brad's given name, from the city where he was conceived). Favreau's scenes, along with Duvall's scenes as Brad's father, are like the magic of Christmas and kwanzaa and chanukah and martian-snow-day all rolled into one.Other parenting roles feature Mary Steenburgen and Jon Voight as Kate's separated parents. Then there's Sissy Spacek as Brad's mom, now sleeping with Brad's best friend Darryl (Patrick Van Horn - Vaughn's and Favreau's pal from SWINGERS, 1996!).FOUR CHRISTMASES does have its hilarious moments - installing a satellite dish on Duvall's roof, Brad playing Joseph in a Nativity Scene that he saves with his latent Community Acting talent, Brad's delectably uncomfortable meeting with his mom and her lover - his best friend/step-dad. And any scene that Jon Favreau is in. I love that man!--Poffy's Movie Mania"
81,"Four Christmases is the case where the inherent jolliness of its cast may disguise the film's lack of sense, consistency, humor, tone, and purpose. Similar things can be said about a number of romantic comedies nowadays such as Friends With Benefits and No Strings Attached, and on an unromantic note, Bad Teacher. Out of that lot, this one is probably the least impressive; it's too bad it can't assemble a great line of jokes and character situations as it can a heartwarming cast.Our story lies with Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon), a happily unmarried couple with divorced parents they never see to avoid contention. For recent years during the holidays, they've vacated their hometown of San Francisco in favor of luxurious paradises instead of staying in the state of California, where they could be bothered by their parents. This year, their vacation to Fiji is cancelled because of an abrupt storm that grounds all flights in and out of the state, and because Brad and Kate were featured on a news report due to the massive cancellation, they must go visit all four of their parents in one day.Keep in mind, being the unmarried people they are, they've never met each others' parents and for good reasons. We find out that Brad's brothers (Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw) are a bunch of narcissistic neanderthals and his father (Robert Duvall) does little to better them, while his mother (Sissy Spacek) is a sweetheart, but so consumed and needy ever since being a brand new relationship. Kate's mom (Mary Steenburgen) is easily smitten, being so taken with Brad's attractiveness, and her father (Jon Voight), in the little time we see him, seems to be a standup father. There's little minor problems in each one of these visits (or vignettes, whatever) but few of them are maximized into central issues.The only one I can see is that Brad and Kate learn that they don't know a whole lot about each other after playing Brad's mother's cockamamie ""Newlywed"" style game that is supposed to test how much you know about your partner. Brad sees that his knowledge on Kate is unusually thin after three years of being together, and Kate realizes that her biggest fear, having kids, may not be such a crippling thing after all, since she gets much experience with children on this trip.Certain instances are cute and generate laughs; take for example the scene in the church, where Brad and Kate are volunteered to play Joseph and Mary, respectively, in a scene replicating the birth of the baby Jesus alongside Dwight Yoakam's energetic pastor. The scene is lively and good-natured, but these seldom scenes that generate a smirk or a small chuckle come sandwiched between mediocre material that serves as story-filler for much of the picture.I'll give Four Christmases credit for a couple things, however. It assembles a talented cast that, for once, handle a romantic comedy in ways that do not seem like a ""phoned in"" job, and the fact that the film is concise and time-managed, not sticking around for another thirty minutes like the ending could've allowed it to. But if there's any reason to endure this eighty minutes of genial filmmaking, it's to see a pleasantly effervescent and charming Reese Witherspoon efficiently handle her material. Her and Vaughn (who has unfortunately been victim to rather mundane material with this and Couples Retreat recently) strike up a solid, likable chemistry that can sustain the film for the most part, even with corny lines and a rather tired line of jokes.On a final blessing, Four Christmases doesn't center around shallow Christmas materialism. Unfortunately, its message is hazily concocted showing a couple seemingly reconnect with each other in a meaningful way, while at the same time attempting to avoid their family during the year's most wonderful time. But I've gone too far in analyzing this picture. From mentioning Dwight Yoakam's pastor to trying to extract a theme I must say, ""mistletoe!"" Starring: Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen, and Dwight Yoakam. Directed by: Seth Gordon."
82,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon star as a career couple who never want to spend Christmas with their families. A trip to Fiji goes awry due to weather problems and they are interviewed on live television which blows their cover. So the two agree to visit their various families on Christmas day which leads to all kinds of unforeseen disasters. Robert Duvall is Vaughn's tough dad, Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw his trained fighter brothers who love to bully him, and Sissy Spacek as his mom ""robbing the cradle"" married to his childhood friend. Reese has a foxy mother(Mary Steenburgen)dating a preacher(Dwight Yoakam who has one of those giant congregations), a sister-in-law(Kristen Chenoweth)who tells Vaughn all sorts of uncomfortable details about his girlfriend's past, and a father(Jon Voight)who has never been fooled by her excuses on why she hadn't visited him over the last few years. This mega-cast appear in light-hearted bits, each incorporating their minor parts with enough quirks and personality to leave a decent impression. Vaughn's mishaps putting up a satellite dish for his disapproving father(and the damage resulting to his house) and performance as Joseph(to Reese's Mary)are highlights, as is Reese's incident inside a ""Jump-Jump"" trying to commandeer a pregnancy test while the kids gang up on her(playing keep-away). There's nothing particularly memorable which beckons repeat viewings at Christmas time, because even the supporting cast have such limited time to truly work their magic--while their star power is quite an asset, and certain individual scenes give the characters some moments, the film really never quite utilizes them to the fullest. The ""conflict"" regarding Vaughn and Reese feels rather forced(as if the filmmakers needed to include complications to have them return to each other having ""learned a valuable lesson""), but I think they have some good scenes together. I didn't buy the ending where the couple decide to ""add a third member"" because it seems they aren't keen on ""being tied down"" as if it was the only way to keep them together after what they endure throughout the movie."
83,"This is a story about a couple who love each other and are very compatible, but they don't intend to get married. All of their parents are divorced and, rather than spending time with any of them for Christmas they always take a trip to a tropical destination and tell a tall tale of doing volunteer work.Vince Vaughn is Brad and his girlfriend is Reese Witherspoon as Kate. (They make an odd visual pairing, he is tall and large while she is short and tiny.) But this holiday, as they try to fly out of San Francisco the fog rolling in grounds all flights out. The local news crews arrive and guess who they find at the ticket counter? And guess who all the relatives see? Not somewhere doing volunteer work, but still in SF.So, to somewhat save face they decide to visit each parent, thus the ""Four Christmases."" At each location many things best described as ""slapstick"" happen to the couple, some are really funny while some are downright stupid.Robert Duvall is Howard, Brad's father. Dad isn't too bad but his two brothers are to be avoided at all costs.Sissy Spacek is Paula, Brad's mom who now is in a relationship with a young man who was Brad's best friend growing up. That gives us a few awkward moments.Jon Voight is Creighton, Kate's dad while Mary Steenburgen is her mom, Marilyn. The jokes there tended to be unflattering accounts of Kate's growing up.But in the end Brad and Kate find a new meaning in their relationship."
84,"Perhaps I was in an overly good mood before bed, or maybe I was just so tired that I'd laugh at anything, but Four Christmases ended up being a pretty good time despite my trepidation and warnings to steer clear by friends. It was cute, somewhat innocuous, and had its fair share of big laughs. By no means is it great cinema, nor intelligent storytelling‚Äîits sub 90-minute runtime shows us only the craziness spending time with the four parts of two divorced marriages and nothing else‚Äîit does its job well. The characters don't evolve, no matter what you think at the end each person is really as selfish as they were at the start. A little dialogue and ""talk"" about the future does nothing to change that. However, that is what makes the movie fun. We don't want them to be kind or gentle, we need them to be cruel and hurtful because that is what makes it funny. We laugh because no matter how bad our own families are, they, hopefully, don't come close to the circus on screen.Our leads, Vince Vaughn's Brad and Reese Witherspoon's Kate, are the biggest culprits involved. They like to tell themselves that they want to stay as far from their parents as possible, not get married, and not have children, because they'd only continue the cycle of dysfunction. Really, though, they are being as selfish as their elders, in the opposite way. Rather than grow to hate each other and separate to hopefully give the children a chance, they stay as close to each other as possible by not letting anything else in to ruin their equilibrium, even withholding facts about their childhoods, like being named Orlando or going to fat camp. One could even say that this duo is worse than the misfit parents/siblings, at least they want to see each other and celebrate Christmas amongst other life events, it is Brad and Kate that forsake all to share a boutique joy that is more of the moment than anything lasting.The story basically is told in the trailer, our couple is grounded from their yearly tradition of lying to the family, (you can't spell families without ""lies""), and going on tropical holiday. While bickering with the airline attendant, a camera crew comes over to ask their opinion about the fog ruining holiday plans, and the next thing you know their phones are ringing and the jig is up. Now they must stay in town and visit two mothers and two fathers separately, along with the motley crew of blood relatives. They discover their love for each other may not be as strong as previously thought and that maybe family is more important to them after all, whether it be theirs together or with the extended lot. Blah, blah, blah, they find things out that make them see each other for who they really are. But, honestly, none of that matters, the plot is thin at best and serves only to loosely connect all the comedic skits together. It is in the supporting roles where this film shines.Don't get me wrong; Vaughn can make even the most inane script entertaining with his seemingly improv-laden schtick. His sympathy pukes are hilarious and his rendition of Joseph at Witherspoon's mother's church a knockout performance, but it is what the families do to him that brings the biggest laughs. Between his UFC-trained brothers beating him up every opportunity or the henhouse consisting of her mother and female-centric clan hitting on Vaughn and touching him whenever they can, his resulting facial reactions ultimately shine. Jon Favreau, as usual, steals most scenes he is a part of. Built of testosterone and machismo, his tearing down of brother Brad is pretty hilarious. And the scene with the game Taboo, it being a staple with my friends and I, just rung true‚Äîthe sequence is orchestrated to perfection with the nuances to playing and how frustrating it can get. The other brother, however, is great too, played by a very underrated singer turned actor in Tim McGraw. He is able to express this sense of vulnerability that surprises me every time once I remember who he is.Everyone else is memorable too. It's nice to see Kristen Chenoweth getting more roles and I always enjoy a good Dwight Yoakam bit part. Mary Steenburgen has seen a sort of renaissance in the past few years of comedy, not disappointing here as Witherspoon's mother, and Robert Duvall plays his crotchety best as deadbeat Dad to Vaughn. Sissy Spacek was entertaining as Vaughn's mother, a bit of a hippie and out of touch with the times, which adds humor to her use of the buzzer in Taboo, and even Jon Voight does an admirable job with the smallest role of the film from a name player. What's Christmas without the true meaning of the holiday being relayed through that guy's mouth? There are moments from them all throughout that got me laughing pretty hard; and I'm not ashamed to admit it. Nothing reaches the level of the opening scene, though, Vaughn showing Witherspoon's Connecticut sexual being how they grow men in the mountains of North Dakota. It's a great piece of role-playing that got me interested real early, making me forgive the weak story that I knew was to follow, by loosening me up for some laughter."
85,"Vince Vaughn funniest film yet and he brought the house down in this one!!! Witherspoon was good, too & probably her funniest film since the first Legally Blonde. As mentioned, there's five Oscar winners in this film: Witherspoon, Duvall, Voight, Spacek & Steenburgen. The only ones that did their part well Duvall (was very funny!!), Spacek (did her part very well), Steenburgen (did OK) & of course, Witherspoon. For the rest of the supporting cast, Kristin Chenoweth (always been a big fan of her) and Jon Favreau were absolutely hilarious!! Four Christmases is NOT your typical Christmas movie, it had lots of crude dialogue & definitely not for kids who are under 13. Sure, this movie had a crazy script, too much gags and a few plot holes but it worked for me and anything with Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon & Kristin Chenoweth, I'm all right it!! Four Christmases is a extremely hilarious and fun holiday flick to watch, it's a must-see!!! 9/10!!"
86,"In reading previous comments, I have to believe that the majority of the IMDb user public are either stuffed shirt Oxford Scholars or are all amateur directors waiting to burst onto the scene. So I'll clarify on what this movie is.This movie comes out the gate by saying ""Hi, I'm a mid-level romantic comedy date movie that is all about a different kind of look on relationships both family and significant others."" It hits that mark perfectly. It's not trying to make you burst out of your seat laughing like a Mel Brooks production. It's also not trying to send you some ""Reason for the Season"" message. This movie is not ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" meets ""Airport"" so don't try to make it be something it's not.It's a campy, playful, and at times satirical take on relationships and the fears we have in them. This one simply takes the fears of a couple who both come from broken homes and the beliefs they share about them. if you take the experiences with the first three families, and then see what happens at the house of the fourth, there's an understanding of what the movie is. Calling this a Christmas movie is like calling Serendipity with John Cusack the same thing. Both are good in their own respects and succeed in being exactly what the set out to become.And yes, EVERYONE knows that Vince Vaughn is a poor actor. He plays the same character in almost EVERY film. When the film needs that type of character, he works out well. When it doesn't, he bombs it. He actually kinda works out well here. Reese Witherspoon is one of my favorite actresses, and does a really nice job acting, even if it's obvious there's no chemistry. They aren't Clark Gable and Vivian Liegh...nor are they trying to be such.Simply put, this is a mid-range romantic comedy that's not trying to be anything more than it is. It's not going to win awards, but it's not trying to either. it's a wonderful little movie that's perfect for what it is.Also, to one of the people blasting the movie, if you're going to take the time to drag down the film, at least try to get one of the main character's names right. It's not BEN, it's BRAD. The character's name is Orlando ""Brad"" McVie."
87,"FOUR CHRISTMASES (2008) **1/2 Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight, Mary Steenburgen, Kristen Chenoweth, Jon Favreau, Tim McGraw, Katy Mixon, Dwight Yoakam. Frequently amusing holiday themed comedy with couple Vaughn and Witherspoon faced with a forced road-trip to visit their 4 divorced parents and family with many personal pitfalls and secrets unearthed along the merry way. Motormouth Vaughn and feisty Witherspoon make for a cute couple and their chemistry drives the at-times unwieldy comedy but get some laughs along the way including a game Favreau and McGraw as Vaughn's wrestlin' bros. (Dir: Seth Gordon)"
88,"this was just an average type movie. it made me uncomfortable in some of the scenes with all the crazy members of each family. but i guess thats what they were going for, the crazy families everyone has to visit during the Christmas holiday. i could of just watched the trailer and got all the funny parts, there wasn't much after I saw the trailer and Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon kind of got annoying after while. also this could of taken place on any holiday... or weekend get away, if you think about it. i think they used this because there hasn't been many holiday movies coming and they decided to do this on Christmas and make some money because people will go see this movie just because it takes place at Christmas time. nothing special here and if you want to see it in theaters, go for the matin√©e or just wait for it on VHS!!! OWWW"
89,"This very funny, very sharp little comedy is fast becoming the underrated cult film of the year. Though a couple of high-profile critics have embraced its sophisticated blend of funny lines, great performances, and occasional forays into dumb-ass slapstick, the majority of folks seem to reject it. It will be a classic in years to come, however. Vaughn and Witherspoon are an odd couple for the ages, and the all-star supporting cast boasts at least two incredibly accomplished performances, Sissy Spacek's and Jon Favreau's. Seth Gordon fulfills the promise of ""The King of Kong."" I expect fantastic things from him in the future.The movie is a criminally underrated gem. Not great, but very, very good. And a keeper for sure."
90,"I had no idea what to expect when I went to see Four Chistmases. I had never heard of it before the day I saw it. To be honest, I actually thought I was going to see Transporter 3. That's what I (thought I) bought tickets for.Why did I stay and watch a movie other than the one I was intending on seeing? Well, for the first forty minutes or so, I thought I was watching Transporter. Then I thought to myself, this setup is going on way too long. Why was Jason Statham buying a Christmas tree? Then I realized, it wasn't Jason Statham at all. Who were these strange people on the screen? And... what were they saying? Their language sounded like English to me, but for some reason I couldn't make sense of the words.A feeling of overwhelming panic and dread began to rise, like a loaf of bread, in the pit of my stomach. I looked around, to see if other members of the audience were having a similar incomprehensible, disorienting experience. If they were, they gave no outward signs of it. They all stared, transfixed, at the screen. Looks ranging between mild amusement and mild boredom across their ugly, complacent faces.I tapped the person next to me, and asked if he knew what was happening. He turned and responded in that same, distinctly familiar nonsense- language they were using in the movie. My neighbors' face was contorted, as if trying to communicate some non-verbal message to me, as the normal avenues of communication had failed. Others were looking too, I realized. The feeling of dread, temporarily forgotten, now returned tenfold.I had to get out of there. Now.But how?I'll do it the normal way. I'll just get up from my chair, and run to the exit. However, my legs gave out beneath me, like two useless loaves of bread. I collapsed. There was talking, either from the movie or from the audience, I could no longer distinguish the difference. And of course I didn't know what they were saying, but I knew it was about me. On the filthy floor of the theatre, I pulled and slithered my way to the exit.Read more reviews at http://guywhoreviewsmovies.blogspot.com/"
91,"That's probably why I thought this movie was good, because I didn't expect much out of it. Instead, the opening scene was what caught my attention which encouraged a sequence of laughter throughout the entire plot.This movie portrayed the misery of family and the foundation of love with a good definition of what happiness could be... and it all came in different packages.It didn't really center on the 'Holiday' theme, but mainly focused on what a 'Family' was. There were occasional parts in the movie which were entirely hilarious.If you're in for a good laugh and occasional belly-rolling performances, then this movie is it, but there would be some silly moments in between shared among the most bizarre characters in the movie.It still left a smile hanging on the end. So get your boots ready, you're in for a wacky show. I certainly enjoyed it."
92,It was overall great comic sketch of two people prospective of staying together while experiences from their families earlier. All the actors did a fantastic job with their roles and made this worth the watch.Although this is not a LOL or LMAO movie but will sure do give a smile on your weekend boring faces.
93,"Can't understand negative reviews....Not sure what people want these days....This movie had it all....Love, family dynamics, jealousy, pregnancy, hardship.......> AND shows very talented actors and actresses at the end of their career and those just beginning having no idea they would get their own very successful sitcom.
What's NOT to like about this movie?
Perfect real life Christmas movie."
94,"So I'm rewatching this on Christmas Eve, always thought it was a funny film and I've suddenly realised what a total a**hole Brad is to his girlfriend and to everyone really. He's a complete big child.The first being when Kate was on the phone to her mother when their flight was cancelled and she had no choice but to say they would visit on Christmas. He interrupts her while on the phone rudely first off and then gets angry when he discovers she said yes to visiting even though he said yes to his dad as well. Yet says don't compare my situation to mine and then blames her for it all and gives her the silent treatment until she breaks it even though she did nothing wrong!They visit Kate's mother where he completely throws her under the bus, ignores how anxious she is, takes the spotlight and humiliates her in front of everyone at church and selfishly praising himself for it because ""quite frankly he brought the show home"" Urghhh!They visit Brads mom where they play Tabboo (great game, we play it every year at Christmas) He's rude to his mother with his spiteful comments. He plays Tabboo with Kate where he goes mad because he feels like she's not playing properly (she is, not her fault he doesn't know the answers) He says he's ""shutting down"" because she obviously doesn't know how to play again no doubt embarrassing her in front of his family.Even worse when Kate realises she does want children and he rudely ignores her wishes and doesn't even stop to consider her feelings above his own. In the end I was rooting for Kate to dump his A**...She completely ignores his behaviour and puts up with it. Great film but man the main guy character was soooo unlikable"
95,"We have watched 4 Christmases every year since its debut in 2008, and laugh just as much as the first time."
96,"This movie is a solid flick for laughs. Vince is classic, full of laughs throughout. Please don't pay any attention to these other reviews, those are the same people that think Jurassic world was amazing."
97,"Let's see. Vince Vaughan, Reese Witherspoon, John Favreaux, Sissy Spacek, John Voight, Robert Duval, et. al. A cast like that deserves a better movie."
98,"Four Christmas is in my opinion, a very futile and poor attempt at a comedy movie. Reese Witherspoon, who I usually love, I didn't care for here, she just didn't suit in her role and in this film overall. Vince Vaughn was just being his usual silly self throughout the entire movie. Mary Steenburgen was enjoyable in here, so was Kristin Chenoweth. They were really the only performances I liked. The segments in the movie were not funny, and they were annoying. Tim McGraw was the most irritating here, Vaughn's family was mediocre and just over the top with the annoyance. The film is uneven and the pacing is sort of off in my opinion. This ""comedy"" just falls flat and doesn't give us any laughs really. 3/10 :/."
99,"I love this movie. I first saw it over Christmas time, in Hawaii, whilst on vacation. I only saw half of it, and finally finished it a few weeks later, when I was at home. I thought it was going to be about four years worth of Christmases, not four different family get-togethers in one Christmas season.In this movie, Kate and Brad, longtime couple, always tell their families that they're doing something really important, like feeding the hungry in Africa or helping children in poor countries. Instead of actually doing those things, they go on a vacation. Whilst in the airport, waiting to catch their flight, the fog in San Francisco is too bad to fly in. The news asks them questions about how they're feeling, which airs, and their families find out that they've been lying for years. They get roped into going to see their families. We see Kate's Mother, Kate's Father, who are divorced. We also see Brad's Father, and his brothers, who are really big red- necks, and Brad's Mother, who are also divorced. Don't worry, everything works out in the end.Overall, I give this movie an 8 out of 10."
100,"I give you Four Christmases. The Reese Witherspoon, Vince Vaughn film that has no heart, no laughter and will not be remembered among the Christmas films to watch on the holiday season.Brad and Kate, Vaughn and Witherspoon, struggle with the fact that they have to meet their families on Christmas Day, once their vacation flight is canceled. The big problem is that their parents are divorced, so they need to make four stops, in one day. Cue the odd family antics and we have a winner.Witherspoon looks great in this film, that's the first thing I noticed. She looks really fantastic. Vince Vaughn gives us his usual fast ball comedy dialogue to get us to laugh. His comedy is something that is seen in everyone of his films, it's the same every time. You either like him or hate him. I thought he was the best thing in Wedding Crashers, here, not so much. The two leads are outdone by every single supporting cast member there is. Robert Duvall plays Vaughn's father. He's man's man and adores his other two sons Denver and Dallas. Why do his brother's have names that are cities and Brad doesn't? Well, he changed his name to Brad because he didn't like his city name. Tim Mcgraw and Jon Favreau play the many brothers. The next family sees the always lovely Mary Steenburgen as Witherspoon's mom, Kristin Chenoweth as her sister and Steve 'Donkey Kong' Wiebe as her husband. Fans of Seth Gordon's previous film, King of Kong will notice that Steve Wiebe was in that film going after the Donkey Kong high score. A much better film, even though they are totally different.So we are then onto Sissy Spacek, Vaughn's mother, who is dating one of his childhood friends, cue more laughter. This is the shortest of the get togethers, probably because the one note joke wasn't working very well. During these family visits, Kate and Brad are learning more than they wanted to about each other. They at first did not want to get married or have a child, but things have suddenly changed for one of them and the other simply can't do it. They had an agreed upon strategy, their relationship was working, now one wants to throw a wrench into the mix. The last house has Jon Voight, no funny moments here, just serious pep talk. Of course by the end of the film the two get back together and start a new plan, a family plan. Cue the awe moment. Four Christmases is not only a bad Christmas film, but it's a bad film all together. The film has two lead characters you won't like or care for, the film has some forced humour and some wasted talent. Do I need to run down the cast list again?"
101,"I don't normally write bad reviews, but this one deserves it.First off, an actor like Vince gives Hollywood a bad name considering all the movies he's been in have been extremely raunchy and crude. The only good movie he was ever in was The lost World; Jrassic Park.Secondly, there are countless remarks of unsettling opinions to the other characters - excluding the fact that Vince's best friend in the movie, basically marries his mother. That in itself is more than twisted - that's gross! The scenes that include Mary Steenbergen are a complete mockery to the Bible and she doesn't even make much of an effort to pretend to be much of a quote on quote Christian.In the long run, I hope the movie comes back to the producers to haunt them for ridiculing the most sacred holiday that mankind has ever known. It was a waste of m y money and I would say that there's nothing good about this film, even though the producers are tying to get an important message across."
102,"A very disappointing film despite the big name cast. At times it uses rather vulgar humour that doesn't fit the festive season at all. To call this a classic Christmas film is laughable as this doesn't compare with the magic of It's a wonderful life, Elf or the Santa Clause. This is everything a Christmas film should not be.I like Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn but they seem to move from one manic set piece to another in a trance and are not helped by a weak script.On the positive side the nativity play scene was mildly funny but it's just a shame the rest of the film was not of the same standard."
103,"Some movies become Christmas traditions, and the holiday season wouldn't be complete without watching them. This is definitely destined to become a Christmas tradition - but in reverse: year after year you'll want to avoid this like the plague lest you ruin whatever enjoyment the holiday season might hold for you.This was dreadful. As Kate and Brad are forced to give up a Christmas vacation in Fiji to visit all four parents homes for the holidays, we end up seeing a revolving door of entirely dysfunctional people, and yet it plays on the fantasy (more ridiculously syrupy in this movie than in any other Christmas movie you'll find) that everything works out in the end, and all these dysfunctional people will come together and make nice with each other, and Kate and Brad will even in the end join their parents and siblings in having a family of their own. There really should have been a law against allowing these two to reproduce.There are perhaps a couple of smiles involved. One that I recall was the devastation wrought in Brad's father's home as they try to install an unwanted satellite dish, but a couple of chuckles can't save a train wreck of a disaster."
104,"Well it's a highly predictable film, in every way, and every character and situation is a stereotype of the sort of things and people you'd expect to find in the US.So it's deeply depressing - from one point of view. From the other, like reading the book of Job, it's funny, not in the way intended, but because it shows just how utterly ghastly life can be for some people.There was virtually no humour in the whole film - tons of humor, though, with all the actors clearly thinking that they were being deeply amusing.In the 'Celluloid Closet', Quentin Crisp remarks on how people who travel to America return to England and remark on how it is so exactly like the films - and, he adds, 'it is'. This film has the hall marks of accuracy."
105,"This time of year brings a few Holiday theme based movies, the first to arrive is ""Four Christmases"" a comedy about family ties and the Joy of the Christmas Holiday. When unwed couple Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) get stranded at the airport in San Francisco, the couple have been lying to their parents, about where they spend the Holiday so they wouldn't have to spend it with any of them. When a newscaster tries to interview the couple they are seen on the local news, and when their parents call them up they have no choice but to agree to a visit. Their first stop is at the home of Brad's father, Howard (Robert Duvall), in the ensuing scenes we see that Brad not only left home to go to college he ran screaming. We meet Brad's (Orlando) brothers Dallas (Tim McGraw) and Denver (Jon Favreau). They are trained UFC fighters and as soon as Brad walks in he is on the floor, it seems the boys have yet to grow up. Denver's wife Susan (Katy Mixon) who is pregnant, again asks Kate to hold her daughter as she cooks a Christmas Meal. When its time to open the presents, the family had set a ten dollar limit, brad did not know about this and his first gift to one of his nephews was an X Box. The second family they visit is the home of Kate's mom, Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen). here Brad gets introduced to Kate's grandmother, who leaves little doubt what she would like to do to Brad. Kate's sister asks her to hold her child while she ""Fixes herself"" while she is holding the baby, he throws up all over her, forcing Kate to go into the bathroom to clean up, while there, bored she finds a pregnancy test and takes it, going against everything she and brad think about family and kids. When she is done her niece, comes into the bathroom and runs with the test capsule outside to where they have a blow up ""jump jump"" forcing Kate to go inside. She is man-handled by the kids who play keep away, until she tells them she peed on it. The two join Marilyn and the family at a church service, led by Pastor Phil (Dwight Yoakam) whom Marilyn is dating. Next the couple visit Brads mom, Paula (Sissy Spacek) who is dating an old friend of Brad's. Denver and his wife Susan show up at the mothers house and while they are eating they play a game of taboo, which gets out of hand. The arguments get worse as they go from family to family, as they reach the last home, that of Kate's father Creighton, (Jon Voight) the only sane one of the group. Brad drives off and leaves Kate to go see her father, Brad goes back to his fathers and as they talk, the scene goes from Kate to Brad and we see how alone they are. The scene where Brad comes back is clich√©d but its cute, as the movie ends the couple have a child of their own, which they hide this fact from their family until a news team comes in - their baby just happens to be the first baby born in the new year- and interviews them. The end is like a scene from the exorcist, the baby that Kate is holding throws up on both of them. I give Four Christmases a 3 and on my avoidance scale I give it a 0. Go laugh and enjoy."
106,"I didn't really know what to expect when i started watching this movie, i was just looking for something to kick start my holiday mood. But there is not really any Christmas spirit in the story. The holidays are just the cause for this story's couple to have to meet up with they're crazy family's and get themselves into all types of crazy situations.Nothing really original there. We have seen similar movies done over and over. So..old jokes spiced up in a brand new package, why not? I had a pretty decent time watching it. Vince Vaughn is always great and so is Reese Witherspoon.They made a very believable couple(besides the fact that from a distance or seen from behind you would think that she was a child next to him). I just never noticed how really big Vince is and how really tiny Reese is till now. But they did a good job and so did everybody else. SPOILER:This is just my view but i was actually kinda annoyed with the whole idea of changing they're entire attitudes on how they want to live they're lives regarding having kids. Such a painfully stupid clich√© to throw in there just to try and give the movie some sort of family, value...something,something clich√©. Especially when i am one of those people who chooses not to have children and i know that when i have a good thing going the way i always dreamed, i am not all of a sudden after dealing with those horribly annoying kids in the bouncy castle, getting puked on, and all the talk about messing up your body gonna change my whole view on the subject!Even an angel baby would not change someone who has had the same view for 30-40 years.I mean why,common? They where awesome and funny because they where different.But i guess we all want to be the same deep inside, right? No. Bad Hollywood clich√©."
107,"Four Christmases is at first sight the typical X-Mas movie where a couple tries to avoid to spend X-Mas with their family but because of a series of circumstances they have no other choice to do it, the difference is that they couple will spend four Christmases in one day. The story is good with moments of very good humor and the plot is very well developed and convincing enough. The cast is very good Vince Vaughn in his typical role of a guy who isn't very attached with his family is hilarious, Reese Witherspoon performance is very funny also, she is like very natural with this kind of comedy. Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, Jon Voight complements the cast with very good performances from all three. In conclusion, this movie only purpose is to entertain in this holiday season and I think it really fulfills it."
108,"Walking into this movie with almost no expectations definitely served me well. I've lost quite a bit of faith in Vince Vaughn over the course of his latest films, and I never had much appreciation for Reese Witherspoon to begin with. As a man, I was pleasantly surprised by the performances given by the two respective leads. It wasn't jaw-dropping, heart-breaking, or Oscar worthy, but the characters managed to breathe some life into the dialog they were given, and I can safely say this movie is mostly devoid of the gag-reflex inducing corniness that pollutes movies in the Christmas / romantic comedy genre.As a whole, this isn't a very strong film. That having been said, there were enough unique and unexpected scenes to make this movie worth watching. The first 20 minutes of the movie were very clever and well crafted.I wouldn't purposely avoid this movie so long as you don't have your hopes very high, and don't expect a traditional holiday message. You may even walk out with a few memorable quote-worthy moments."
109,"I really don't know what else to say other than it was a really funny movie, even funnier than I thought it was going to be. Vince Vaughn played a really funny role, and Reese was good as well (although not as funny). The actors had good chemistry together.The only thing that I didn't understand about the movie was how it was obviously set in California (Bay Area), however, for some reason many members from both of their families sounded like they were from Georgia or North Carolina--didn't seem like it fit in with the plot, but whatever. It was funny and that's why I wanted to see it, and I was not disappointed. I love Christmas and I love funny movies so this was a perfect combination for me. This film will probably be the best Christmas movie of the season. So, Merry Christmas!...and see this movie!"
110,"(In the style of the Christmas song ""Twelve Days of Christmas"")On the first Christmas of the film ""Four Christmases"" This film sent to me Slapstick comedy that was too weakOn the second Christmas of the film ""Four Christmases"" This film sent to me A dysfunctional family and Slapstick comedy that was too weakOn the third Christmas of the film ""Four Christmases"" This film sent to me A silly Taboo scene A dysfunctional family and Slapstick comedy that was too weakOn the fourth Christmas of the film ""Four Christmases"" This film sent to me A formulaic romantic scene A silly family reunion scene A dysfunctional family and Slapstick comedy that was too weak (end of song)Hopefully, you got my mingle of the jingle of ""Four Christmases"". I yell FOUR to warn you on the dragging aspects of this film. Vince Vaughn & Reese Witherspoon star as lovers Brad & Kate, whom visit their four dysfunctional families on Christmas Day due to the fact that their planned Christmas vacation to Fuji has been cancelled due to foggy weather conditions. Brad & Kate's respected parents are divorced so that is why they had to go for the quartet visits. The paternal acting clan in ""Four Christmases"" include: Sissy Spacek, Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen, and Jon Voight. All the aforementioned have won Oscars, but their performances here are not going to earn them a repeated Oscar statuette gift. Jon Favreau and Tim McGraw play Brad's fiery combat brothers Denver & Dallas, who part time as ultimate fighting competitors. But my unanimous decision is that their ridiculous slapstick scenes should have been left in the editing room floor. Favreau, who is a real talent as an actor and director, has been Vaughn's longtime collaborator. Their past collaborative projects have been a real chemical charm (see ""Swingers"") but in ""Four Christmases"" they absolutely failed their chemical charm Christmas exam. The slapstick does not suit them; go back to the gab, guys! Cause you guys are money with the gab and not the fists! Although, Vaughn's gabby ""Vaughnisms"" are used wittingly often in the film with other characters. There were various merry Christmases laughs within Vaughn's comments especially a hilarious ""Shawshank Redemption"" reference that had me thinking that there might be ""hope"" after all for ""Four Christmases"". Witherspoon's work as Kate was mediocre to say the least, but Vince and Reese did reach a certain acceptable height in the acting chemistry department. Director Seth Gordon and Screenwriters Matt Allen & Caleb Wilson did not give this Christmas justice with their mindless story and senseless scenes. It was both a ""naughty"" and ""not nice"" cinematic so-called gift to throw upon us in this joyous Holiday season. Nevertheless, the ""Vman"" (Vince Vaughn) was the ultimate savior of ""Four Christmases""; even though it was a ""Vince there, done that"" performance. But it is the holidays, so you would not be scrooging yourself so hard if you take a foursome chance with the ""Four Christmases"". *** Average"
111,"I will keep this much shorter than some others...I think just one thing needs to be said that has not been and that is this: before you go see this movie there is one thing you MUST understand. It is a simple comedy. If you keep this in mind and go in with a light heart you will enjoy it. It is not for the ""uppity"" crowd, but rather the crowd that is there to have a good time, not needing anything too ""deep"". Remember that you aren't going to see Schindler'S List or Letters From Iwo Jima or Babel and you'll be fine. This is a mindless (although this has a negative connotation, I can't think of another word that would fit in so seamlessly) comedy that will brighten your night. Several parts had me literally gasping for breath and doubling over because I was laughing so hard."
112,"Four Christmases will not change the world of comedy, it's certainly not among the funniest movies of this year (such as Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Pineapple Express), but it definitely has more than a few laugh out loud moments. This film does seem to follow a typical PG-13 Reese Witherspoon comedy outline, and, not to mention, the third quarter of the film almost completely falls apart. The first three Christmases are each very original and hilarious in their own way, but the fourth is dull and seems to drag on forever. All criticism aside, Four Christmases is much better than most of the Christmas movies we've seen in the past few years, and will probably be one of the better Christmas movies in the next few upcoming years. Most of the family members have their hilarious scenes (most notably Sissy Spacek and her ""taboo"" scene), so this is overall a completely watchable comedy that is worth the price of an admission ticket.-3 out of 4 stars"
113,"Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Brad (Vince Vaughn) have been together for three years and are still besotted with each other. Neither of them is particularly fond of their families, though (both sets of parents are divorced, so there are four families to contend with), which is why Kate and Brad make it a point to go on exotic vacations at Christmas, while telling their families white lies about doing humanitarian work. However, when fog grounds all Christmas flights and a TV news crew injudiciously broadcasts Kate and Brad, their cellphones immediately go off, leading to unwanted trips to all four households. And, as the trips proceed one by one, we learn why Kate and Brad avoid their families. They learn things about themselves and each other, and not all they learn is good news.First of all, this film is funny. There are a number of laugh-out-loud moments. And, importantly, much of the humour derives from character and situation. The small amount of bad language is mild, the vulgarity quotient is low, and the message is a positive one. It is maybe a touch over-sentimental but hey! c'mon, it's a Christmas movie! Actually, Christmas is merely the backdrop, the film is about something rather more fundamental than simply Christmas, and there is a great deal of truth in both the script and the performances.The cast is excellent, but special mention must go to Brad's Dad (Robert Duvall, very funny) and his two awful brothers, his Mother's boyfriend (an audible gasp in the theatre), and Kate's Dad (a dignified John Voight, delivering probably the most serious speech in the film).Vaughn has this sort of part nailed, and it's good to see his stock character no longer displaying the air of mild sleaze which has followed him in earlier films. Still, he has a wide range, and it would be good to see him stretched beyond this type of part: sympathetic as it may be, it doesn't really challenge him. Witherspoon always impresses, and continues to do so here.This comedy has some meat on its bones, is devoid of the witless coarseness which so many comedies seem to be built on these days, and has some heart - I recommend it."
114,Four Christmases was an extremely funny movie. This movie was perfect for Christmas time and had all the vibe of Christmas spirit in it. I think the story lacked a little bit and the movie really never did have much heart in it. It did have many funny parts in the movie but could've been better. I thought the movie was mostly selfish with all of the characters. If you erase all the flaws though then you will absolutely love this movie. I did love this movie to a certain extent. The acting was very good. All the actors played their parts very well. I thought that the idea of the couple running back and fourth from house to house was great. They easily could've added more to the story then just that though. Overall the movie was entertaining and great to watch.
115,"Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon generate chemistry galore as a couple of cute yuppies who're afraid to get hitched in first-time director Seth Gordon's hilarious new holiday hootenanny ""Four Christmases,"" a raucous, PG-13 rated, romantic comedy of errors complete with Three Stooges style slapstick routines. Although our protagonists think they have it made as live-in lovers, they learn eventually that the road to happiness is paved with marital vows and infants. The source of the wit in ""Four Christmases"" grows out of what this pair doesn't know about each other. They're compelled to cancel an exotic trip to Fiji and endure four episodes with their dysfunctional families. Quadruple the hilarity of the Ben Stiller & Terry Polo comedy ""Meet the Parents,"" and you'll have some clue about how much you'll cackle. The cast bristles with Oscar-winning celebrity thespians such as Robert Duvall, Sissy Spacek, and Jon Voight. Mind you, ""Four Christmases"" isn't aimed at children, but grown-up audiences will guffaw at the misguided misanthropy of the irresponsible protagonists.Although they've been dating each other for three years, neither Brad (Vince Vaughn of ""Fred Claus"") nor Kate (Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon of ""Walk the Line"") have any intention of approaching the altar. Marriage would merely complicate matters for this free-spirited twosome. Anyway, marriage didn't work out for their parents who wound up divorcing. Brad and Kate shy away from that kind of commitment. Every Christmas for the last three years, they send their regrets to their parents that they won't be able to visit because they're performing charitable acts for destitute people in third world countries. Brad goes so far as to research his lies so they contain a ring of veracity. Our couple arrives at the airport to pick up their tickets when they discover to their chagrin that a pea-soup fog has grounded all flights. Matters worsen when a TV news crew captures them 'live' on camera commenting about their Fiji holiday disaster. No sooner have Brad and Kate been exposed as hypocrites than their respective family members contact them and invite them out for a bit of Christmas cheer. Reluctantly, Brad and Kate set out to make the best of a bad predicament with no idea that their lives are about to change beyond anything that they had imagined.The screenplay by Matt R. Allen, Caleb Wilson, Jon Lucas, and Scott Moore turns out to be funnier than you'd expect considering that ""Four Christmases"" is formulaic frivolity from start to finish. Virtually everything that can go wrong for our heroes does, but everything works out for the best by fade-out. The comedy is predictable but nevertheless entertaining. Gordon and his writers depict our couple in the worst case scenarios.Brad and Kate visit Brad's divorced dad who keeps a stuffed skunk on the wall as well as rabbit hunting trophies. Brad has to contend with his two muscle-bound, Neanderthal-minded brothers Denver (""Iron Man"" director Jon Favreau) and Dallas (Tim McGraw), who're semi-professional cage wrestlers. They constantly embarrass poor Brad by pinning him to the floor in humiliating head and body locks and then bringing in their obnoxious brats to slap him silly. Kate learns that Brad's real name is Orlando. Brad's redneck pappy Howard (Robert Duvall of ""Open Range""), who drives a combine for a living, named his sons after the city where he sired them. Brad gives Howard a satellite system, but he winds up wrecking his father's house trying to install it.Things fare no better for Kate when they visit her mother, Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen of ""Stepbrothers""), who reveals the secrets of her daughter's past. Brad learns that Kate grew up as a goofy little fat child who got shipped off every summer to Fat Camp. Brad laughs hysterically at Kate's obese baby pictures and pokes fun at Kate's only friend, a butch gal pal, who wears an incriminating haircut. Worse, Kate's sister Courtney (Kristen Chenoweth of ""Stranger than Fiction""), divulges Kate's mortal fear of being trapped in an inflatable trampoline with the neighborhood kids who accused her of having cooties. Kate relives that horror after Courtney's infant barfs on her after a breast-feeding and sends her off to the bathroom for an apparel change. While she is in the bathroom, Kate experiments with a pregnancy kit, only to have Courtney's older daughter steal the kit and seek the sanctuary of a trampoline teeming with noisy urchins.As it turns out, Marilyn's latest beau is a Pentecostal minister, Pastor Phil(Dwight Yoakam of ""Sling Blade""), who wants volunteers to impersonate Joseph and Mary for their annual Christmas play. Marilyn volunteers Kate because her daughter played a tree in her high school play and Pastor Phil summons Brad to join her. A real child is thrust into Kate's arms, and she is clueless about what to do even when Pastor Phil provides her with instructions in the manger scene. Surprisingly, this church scene is played fairly straightforward with the laughs on our couple instead of what they are doing. Afterward, they visit Brad's mother, Paula (Sissy Spacek of ""Coal Miner's Daughter""), who has married Brad's best friend, collects New Age objects, and bakes marihuana in her brownies. Brad hates his best friend for tying the knot with his momma, and Kate roars when Paula tells her that Brad never wanted to stop breast feeding.Seth Gordon's claim to fame is a documentary called ""The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters"" about a father in the suburbs who struggles to rack up the highest recorded Donkey Kong video game score. The secret of Gordon's success with this hackneyed material is the way he maintains a swift pace so the gags follow each other in rapid succession. ""Four Christmases"" will tickle your ribs and jingle your bells for every second of its comically crisp 90 minutes."
116,"This is one of THE movies you have to watch this year! Its just unbelievably funny. Yes I can see people whining in the forums about it but come on, get a life. This movie is made to make you laugh, not to compare it with your life and cry about it.Vince Vaughn's character is just superb. Acting is excellent as usual. All the characters have acted their best. The story was good, the direction was excellent, overall its a tenner!! Trust me, you have to watch it in the theaters and not at home. There is nothing explicit or hardcore about the movie, no x-rated scenes, no violence, no gore, don't believe what other people are writing about it, just watch it for yourself! I would keep it in my list of funniest movies of all time. If you cant really understand how Vaughn speaks because he is too fast, you probably wont understand his lines and you wont find him funny. But don't whine about the movie, learn to appreciate others and accept their good work! If you think its not funny, how about YOU go and make a movie then? Stop whining! Watch it! Its AWESOME!! 10 out of 10! Kind Regards."
117,"It is definitely not your average Christmas movie, but Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon did the best they could with it. Although it had very Tropic-Thunder-esquire humor and made jokes of some mildly controversial topics, it was not a bad film. It told the story of two people who wanted nothing more than to spend their vacation in Fiji, away from their divorced parents and four families. Personally, I thought that this movie was borderline rated-R. I was a little shocked when I walked out of the film, wondering how it could've gotten a PG-13 rating, when in fact, I would never take my 13 year old brother to ever see this movie.I loved it though! The Joseph scene with Vince Vaughn was the absolute best! Be warned also that almost all of the characters are somehow obsessed with sex or are the center of some sexual joke. Also, although, in the beginning, I did think that Reese and Vince made an odd couple (their height difference was hilariously noticeable, especially when Vince consistently put his hand on Reese's head), I fell in love with them in the end. Very nice movie, but very, very dirty humor. 9/10 stars."
118,"Vince Vaughn at his most typical and irritable. A simply woeful 'comedy' of errors. So miscast with Vaughn and Witherspoon, left me puzzled how they could remain together for four holidays, not alone for four minutes."
119,"I've been waiting for such a long time for this movie to be released on DVD and now it finally happened.This is a movie about a big city couple who want nothing else than to enjoy each other's presence. On Christmas they plan to travel to Fiji away from all their family members but when their flight gets canceled they decide to go visit their families instead, both their parents are divorced so they have 4 different places to visit on Christmas eve.The chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon is great, I would have liked to see more movies with the two of them. There are a lot of hilarious scenes which I could easily relate to. All in all it was a great comedy and an easy to watch movie."
120,"Seth Gordon has made entertaining & memorable Cinema in 'Four Christmases'. The filmmaker succeeds all the way. The concept is interesting and above-all fresh. A couple go to visit their divorced parents on Christmas Day. The 4 chapters, each of them are highly entertaining... never letting the momentum down. Another major plus point of the film is it's running time. It's short and sweet, never making an attempt to drag. Now coming to performances: Vince Vaughn is fantastic. He carries the film on his broad shoulders, his comic timing is impeccable. Watch him in the scene where a TV reporter asks him his view on flights being delayed, or the scene where his newly-born baby pukes. They are simply hilarious! Reese Witherspoon is very good; but why is she looking so old throughout the film? Legends Jon Voight, Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen & Sissy Spacek are superb in their respective parts. On the whole, this one's a must watch."
121,Do yourself a favor this Christmas season and don't add this movie to your holiday watch list.
122,"I thought that I would regret seeing this film because of all the negative reviews it has been getting. But I decided to give this movie a shot because it has Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon in it. During the beginning, it looked like that this movie would be tripe. But the movie got going as soon as the families were introduced.This movie is about a couple who were about to travel to Fiji for Christmas and not visiting families. But their flight was canceled and they were interviewed on TV. Now they have no choice but to go and visit their families.The acting is not too bad as it seems. The cast is probably the best cast a movie like this can get. Robert Duvall was my favorite. He's the funniest of all the characters. I wasn't that impressed with Vince Vaughn. He had much funnier roles in movies like Dodgeball.If you want to see a feel-good holiday movie, then this is the one to see. There are better holiday films out there but I would see this one. I rate this film 8/10."
123,"The actors are great. Plot-line was great. Comedy is okay. Location's are good in it. But i expected something better from this movie. It doesn't stand its name. Meaning that the name is way better without the movie. Four Christmases is a one time watch in the cinema. And not a movie your willing to buy. I guess that's what i think. I went to the movie thinking 'Wow! It's number 1 in the US box office. And for two weeks too. But when i came out, i said to myself that this movie was not that much to stay 2 weeks in the US box office. It's a normal Christmas plot movie that is okay to watch. Well it's what i think any way. Thanks for reading...."
124,"Four Christmases is an occasionally funny comedy. I didn't hate the film I thought it was alright its okay. I mean there are worse ways spending time at cinema and much better too. I did laugh its funny I give you that, I did laugh out loud three or four times but there are some good things about the film. Its occasionally funny, Vince Vaughn was Jon Favreau give the biggest laughs in the movie when they are together there's solid comedy with them two buy the rest of the comedy is pretty mediocre, the story was simply and it entertains you quick I mean the films is only about 1 hour and 20 minutes. It wouldn't hurt watching this in the cinema or watching it as a rental. I recommend it because I didn't mind the film for me its harmless and good for some laughs, its Meet the Parents with more Oscar winners and not as good but still its pretty funny movie.Rating: 6.7 / 10"
125,"How many times can the main characters ask ""what are you talking about"" to each other? Ugh. I can't stand Jon Favreau and he was the funniest part of this movie. Vince rambles as he always does, Reese is beyond irritating and her snooty persona are ridiculous. Skip the movie."
126,"Terrible people lie to family about helping the less fortunate over Christmas so they can go on vacation. Instead they get caught and have to visit 4 relative's houses. Most, but not all, of the relatives are as rotten as Vaugh's and Witherspoon's characters. This gets 1 star for at least acknowledging Jesus's birth.
I guess if you hate Christmas you might like this movie. Or if you just hate humanity."
127,"What can I saw ? This movie had so much potential with Reese and Vince. I'm a fan of both within 30mins, what started off on a high went down super fast. Did the writers lose full concentration? Wow ! That was so bad, I was just wanting and waiting for it to end. Sorry Reese, you're absolutely beautiful but I really didn't enjoy that."
128,"Even by the increasingly low standards of Hollywood romcoms, this was a very poor effort. There wasn't even an attempt at a storyline and the 'acting' was as lazy and cliched as you could expect to see. Even worse, we were subject to various vomit-inducing conversations on the meanings of love and relationships.Vince Vaughn is probably the only Frat Pack member who can salvage this kind of movie, but even he was powerless in the face of this atrocious writing. He had virtually zero on-screen chemistry with Reese Witherspoon, which was essential for this film to be any kind of success. A lazy cash-grab with no redeeming features."
129,"Review:
'Four Christmases' is a Christmas comedy-drama film directed by Seth Gordon.
This movie gets a lot of hate both on its comedy aspect and Christmas. I personally don't get it; I love this movie and watch it multiple times over the Holiday's.
The film follows Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon), who have made something of an art form out of avoiding their families during the holidays, but this year their foolproof plan is about go bust - big time. Stuck at the city airport after all departing flights are canceled, the couple is embarrassed to see their ruse exposed to the world by an overzealous television reporter. Now, Brad and Kate are left with precious little choice other than to swallow their pride and suffer the rounds.
Vince Vaughn knows comedy and he does a great job in this movie. Every time he is on screen, I'm in stitches, especially when he is on screen with his partner in crime, Jon Favreau. Reese Witherspoon on the other hand handles the more serious role in this movie and for the most part does a good job. You also get good comedic performances out of Robert Duvall, Mary Steenburgen and Tom McGraw of all people!
I loved the story being told here. It's original and has the comedic tensions that it needs to have. Where I had a problem with the movie is the chemistry between Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon. Even though they were good on screen together comedically they didn't fit right as a couple.
Overall, the movie has lots of laughs and is a fun time around the Holiday's.
3.5/5"
130,Waste of time. Probably worse film ever watched. Nightmare production with horrible acting.
131,"Yes it's a bit slow and there's no real meaning to it, but the families are all great! The actors are all perfect for their parts too. Except! For Jon Voight. Who nearly ruins every film he's in or has been in since Deliverence."
132,"This was pretty terrible. The only time I actually laughed was at Vince Vaughn's reaction to the baby puke, the rest was just silly and often painful. Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon play a happily unmarried couple who are forced to spend Christmas with the families of their divorced parents... making that yes, 4 Christmas visits in one day, after their annual vacation getaway falls through and they get caught out on the news at the fogged in San Francisco airport. These two have zero chemistry together and the entire movie follows a series of generic gags and misunderstandings. E.g., Reese in a bouncy castle with a bunch of bratty kids trying to get her pregnancy test back that she just randomly took (for kicks) in her sisters bathroom. I caught this on TV, I'm glad I didn't spend any money to watch it. Lots of familiar faces from the parents and extended family helped me get thorough this while at the same time wonder why they were in the movie? All in, nothing special, a Christmas time waster."
133,"Four Christmases (2008): Dir: Seth Gordon / Cast: Vince Vaughn, Reese Witherspoon, Robert Duvall, Mary Steenbergen, Sissy Spacek: Mediocre holiday comedy about getting the most out of life. That could be largely aided by just avoiding this film altogether. Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon try to avoid family at Christmas but when they are unable too, they are put in a position where they must visit both sets of divorced parents in one day. This becomes a headache to them as well as those viewing the film. The premise is rushed but the concept was stale to begin with. Formula storytelling and a predictable outcome also fails to materialize this beyond the list of worst Christmas films. Director Seth Gordon is backed by fine performances by Vaughn and Witherspoon but veteran supporting cast that includes Robert Duvall and Mary Steenburgen are a waste. Vaughn must face certain facts that have the potential to threaten his marriage and other relationships, although one can understand his dismay at the reality of a former friend marrying his mother. Witherspoon now decides that she wants children, as if that must be the ultimate goal for a family. The veteran actors can only relish the shame that unfolds. Sissy Spacek in particular is a shameful waste barely uttering a word, but then again, this is a massive step down from Coal Minor's Daughter. Crammed together mess results in four times the waste of time. Score: 4 / 10"
134,so a film comes along for Xmas as this is kind of reality in a way so this film is 1hr 28mins of fun filled angst if you been through it with this all star cast means that the star couple question each others ideas of commitment as they are test to the limit of their own moral ground they try and get away brad and Kate (resse Witherspoon and Vince Vaughan ) they are brilliant in this relationship issues film but anyway the like going away each Xmas to keep away from their family as their respective parents are with other people so with holidays booked and nature decides that Kate and brad are dealt a severe blow to their ideas and get found out in certain media so they have to meet brad father Robert duvall character Howard who likes to drink and play hard along with his son Orlando and Denver who beat the crap out him and play decides a certain present would be good so this cause havoc so meet their other families in this film like when they play Jesus and brad takes the lead in the nativity play this buts questions into Kate head about children as she had a rough childhood plus brad dis like of spewing from children plus a quiz all the couples seem compatible to each other apart from 2 guess who this film is fun and gross but you will be laughing i saw this in the cinemas i give this 7/10 one of the better ROM com Xmas movies his mother her mother her mother his father all in one day this is my 119 review
135,"Are Vince Vaughn's movies all portraying days in the life of the same guy? I have enjoyed most of his movies that I've seen, but it seems he's always the same character, and this film was no different. He was just with Reese Witherspoon this time, and I can't really wrap my head around this pairing. The idea of going to 4 Christmases on the same day is a funny enough premise (both couples come from divorced parentage, so 2 Christmases per), but these 2 normally skip town on Christmas to avoid their respective whacked out families and are now stuck at home because of weather. For country fans there's Tim McGraw AND Dwight Yoakim. There's just enough heart in this film to make it worth watching, but I wouldn't consider it a holiday classic by any means"
136,"When upscale, happily unmarried San Francisco couple Kate and Brad find themselves socked in by fog on Christmas morning, their exotic vacation plans morph into the family-centric holiday they had, until now, gleefully avoided. Out of obligation-and unable to escape-they trudge to not one, not two, but four relative-choked festivities, increasingly mortified to find childhood fears raised, adolescent wounds reopened...and their very future together uncertain. As Brad counts the hours to when he can get away from their parents, step-parents, siblings and an assortment of nieces and nephews, Kate is starting to hear the ticking of a different kind of clock. And by the end of the day, she is beginning to wonder if their crazy families' choices are not so crazy after all.I would recommend Four Christmases just if you wanna see a cute holiday movie in the theater this year. Vince and Reese had good chemistry and this movie just represents the craziness of having to go to all the families every year for Christmas. There are some really good laughs here and there, I loved the scene where Reese played the Virgin Mary and Vince was Joesph in their church play and Reese just gets stage fright and freezes while Vince just makes a fool of himself on stage. Over all this is a cute movie, there's nothing special about it, but it's worth the look."
137,"Maybe you have to be a man to like this film. I hated most of it, to the point that the best part of the film was the ending.Packed full of wonderful stars that obviously had nothing better to do, or were desperate for the money ... as I can see no other reason to be in this disaster.It was nice to see Sissy Spacek, but the part was totally beneath her as an actress of great acclaim and talent. But that can be said for many of those that appeared in this prelude to a panic attack. I rate this film one star above Pee Wee's Christmas DVD ... which remains my all-time favorite personality to avoid at any cost! This DVD goes in the trash.Well, there you have it ... my opinion about this piece of crapola that literally caused me to be nauseous, as well as to have a panic attack! If I was related to these disgusting characters ... I'd send my Christmas List to the AlQaida network in Iraq!"
138,"Brad (Vince Vaughn) and Kate (Reese Witherspoon) are very selfish people. They both hate marriage and kids. They can't stand their family or quite frankly any family. They lie to everybody about their Christmas plans and try to vacation in Fiji. Only they are stranded when weather shuts down all the flights. Their families find out their canceled plans when they are surprised on a live TV report. The couple is then forced to visit 4 sets of family Christmases.This is not a likable couple, and Vince Vaughn is stuck playing the same annoying character as he also does. He needs to try to stretch his acting skills because this fast talking jerk character is getting old. It's especially bad when the movie sucks as bad as this. For a Christmas movie, it is a joyless experience. At least, Reese Witherspoon tries to tap into her charm. In the end, none of it works. None of it is funny."
139,"I can only think of a couple good Christmas films that have been released in the 2000's, The Grinch and Elf, all the others have been average or terrible, this one was rated very low and I was hoping would not fit the rating the critics give it, so I chanced it. Basically Kate (Reese Witherspoon) and Bradford 'Brad' McVie (Vince Vaughn) have been in love and together for three years, and not being married or having children have their own fun, such as role play experiences, and they plan to spend Christmas coming on vacation, telling their parents they are going to Fiji. But when their flight is cancelled by bad weather and they unintentionally appear on the news, they are forced into having to spend time with their parents, both their mothers and fathers have divorced, meaning that they live separately, and they will have go to four Christmases. Agreeing the safe word ""mistletoe"" if they want to leave, they start by seeing Brad's father Howard (Robert Duvall) on his farm, with brother Dallas (Tim McGraw) and his two children, and brother Denver (Jon Favreau) and his wife and baby, and they reveal that Brad's real name was originally Orlando and they cause high tension and stress when trying to install a new satellite dish. Next they go to see Kate's mother Marilyn (Mary Steenburgen) along with her sister, her two aunts and her grandmother, and they reveal that Kate used to be fat and they run into some problems on stage when replacing the original stars of the local nativity for the overly religious Christian church. Visiting Brad's mother Paula (Sissy Spacek) who is a hippie, more and more things are revealed that Brad didn't originally know about while being with Kate, this is of course leads to a big argument between them because they have known each other three years and not told the truth about everything in their past. With the couple parted while things cool down and they are ready to talk again Kate goes to the last of the four Christmases alone to see her father Creighton (Jon Voight), who seems like just a regular man, but obviously feels bad for his daughter and urges that she tries to make things right between them. In the end of course Kate and Brad reconcile and promise to tell each other everything in the future, they go on their holiday to Fiji, and year later on New Year's Day they have a baby girl, and they didn't tell their parents this, but again they are unintentionally on the news as the baby is the first new-born in the city. Also starring RV: Runaway Vacation's Kristin Chenoweth as Courtney and Dwight Yoakam as Pastor Phil. Witherspoon is beautiful and lovely, Vaughn is okay, and the supporting actors I guess are fine, I will admit I did like the opening with the odd role play getting into different characters for sex later, but this is the only bit that made me smile and laugh a little, the rest of it is utter rubbish, the four Christmases are too cringe worthy that they are not funny, the characters they visit are either irritating or unbearable, and the situations that they get into are predictable and mostly unoriginal, it is a ridiculous and awful seasonal comedy. Pretty poor!"
140,"Four Christmases is funny, but a certain number of flaws make it less appealing to me.First off, Vince Vaughn uses some of the same tricks he did in Wedding Crashers (to be reviewed), but at least he's toned down a bit. For the most part, though, the acting is good, if purposefully over caricatured, even Vince. Reese is obviously leading the pack. Robert Duval is not far behind: you just love to hate his character.Second, the scenario gives us two characters with out of the box ideas at the start, but we loose them by the end. Well, not completely, however, it's enough to put a damper on my appreciation.Lastly, there are some illogical sequences of event in the story, especially at the start.Despite all that, it's still funny, and the premises are quite original. If they could only have continue in the same vein, the final product would have been great.If you wanna a see a positive Christmas story with an interesting setup that requires very little thinking, I think you should go for it."
141,"The point of Christmas movies is to find something that people would enjoy watching that time every year. Sadly, this is not one of those movies. After watching it once, I would not recommend it to anyone. There is no point to it. It isn't funny like it's supposed to be. Nothing interesting happens throughout the whole film. I can't think of anyone who would enjoy this. They are entitled to their opinions, but I don't enjoy this film. If you've never seen it, then don't waste your time with it. The characters in the film can't do what they want to do and decide to spend it with family, which, according to the film, is a bad thing. I really don't get it. Both parents are divorced and there are four separate Christmas celebrations to one day. But that really doesn't make a good movie. Nothing in it was funny and I would steer clear of junk like this."
142,"I'm pretty easy going when it comes to comedies , it doesn't take too much to get me to laugh, and I usually enjoy a good Christmas movie but this was just bad! The premise for the movie interested me but it wasn't too far in, that both my husband and I were saying how dumb this film was! The chemistry between Witherspoon and Vaughn was terrible. Their personalities were not exactly likable. The jokes were not very funny. The only scene I actually enjoyed was the wrestling scene between Vaughn and his brothers. I always enjoy Jon Favreau. This movie did nothing to get me in the Christmas spirit. With such an all star cast, very disappointing!"
143,"A young couple who is leading a perfect life is forced to spend Christmas with families of their divorced parents.This is a Christmas movie that had a lot of potential. First of all, it had 5 Oscar winners and the rest of the cast are great actors as well. So the performance was on a pretty high level.In addition it had a pretty funny storyline and great jokes. No, I am not trying to say that it was a movie for deep thinking. And one knew exactly how it will end. But it was hilarious nonetheless.Unfortunately, the movie got ruined by trying to include a moral lesson. And this is the lesson that I saw many times in the movies and am already tired of. It tells us how no couple can be really happy together if they don't get married and have babies. And it is done so poorly. Why should I believe that a couple in love that spend all the time together didn't know each other's habits and didn't communicate as well as the redneck brother of Brad and his super pregnant wife? Why would I believe that Kate who had a perfect life, fully aware of what nonsense marriage is changed her mind after spending time with their dysfunctional families and their annoying bratty kids? Sure, it is a perfect message for Christmas where all movies are supposed to be cheesy, but it didn't fit into this movie at all. They started it is an over the top comedy and that was the way to finish it. I almost feel like it wasn't part of the original script and for some unknown reason they decided to add it It took me some time to decide if I should give it a 6 or a 7. The problem I described in the last paragraph pretty much ruined it. But it is hard to give anything less than 7 for a movie that has some brilliant and funny scenes. Some of my favorites was them being caught on camera at the airport, Kate throwing kids around in the blow up castle and of course the Joseph scene."
144,"Brad and Kate have been together three years, in love, having fun, doing all sorts of things together with no intention of marriage or children.Christmas morning, they're on their way to Fiji, having told their two sets of divorced parents that they're off to do charity work.Through a fluke, they have no choice but to visit each of their four idiosyncratic parents.As the day progresses, Brad and Kate remember growing up, each learns more about the other And Kate realises that her life may not be as good as it could be...Pretty much everything you could expect from a Christmas movie starring Vaughn is in here. From his sarcastic tone, to his cringe worthy moments, nothing is left to the imagination. Vaughn makes the movie, and everyone else is along for the ride.Witherspoon has a look on her face as if to say, I can do funny as well as Oscar, but doesn't convince, so we are left with the notable actors playing the parents to notch up the laughs, as this is the fundamental part of the films story.It's a bit hit and miss. Thanks to Favreau, Duvalls segment becomes irritating very quickly, But Spacek and Steenburgens segments are by far the funniest and realistic. Voights is okay, but just a tad too late, and a little boring.So all in all, it's a typical Christmas movie, easy to watch, with some soppy message about family put into the mix."
145,"After reading good and bad reviews regarding this movie, I see now where the discrepancy lies. If this movie is reviewed on the merits of a classic, feel-good holiday flick, it is going to come up short. If it is viewed as a romantic comedy about a couple having to endure their displeasing family members for the sake of Christmas, I think it works well and is enjoyable. Vince Vaughn and to a lesser extent, Reese Witherspoon bring their usual charm to the movie. Vaughn's usual swagger is present and keeps the movie fresh and fun. Only in the last 20 minutes after some classic, romantic comedy soul-searching, is there some drag. As a romantic comedy goes, this is a movie you can sit down with your girl and it not become a painful experience. For that, it gets a good rating."
146,"WOW? One would think that a cast of Oscar Winners, in a film set at Christmas time would be a pleasurable movie. I really wanted to like this, BUT it was so lame, it just was not that funny or enjoyable.The director was Seth Gordon, there were four writers of the screenplay,Maybe if it was all 'ad libbed' it would have been funnier.The cast are all top draw persons. Vince Vaughn & Reese Witherspoon are the leads, Robert Duvall, Jon Voight, Mary Steenbergen Sissy Spacek,are their parents, Jon Favenau & Dwight Yoakum are featured..With this cast, we should have been treated to a gem of a movie,.We never feel the joy of the season.The best thing I can say is that the movie is short only 82 minutes before the credits roll.It really should have been a much better film.Ratings: **1/2 (out of 4) 72 points (out of 100) IMDb 6 (out of 10)"
147,"I originally was flipping channels on HBO and nothing good was on so Isaw that this was coming on so I was like, what the hell....I was drawn to the beginning of it and kept watching it, and I liked it a lot. Itsnot a movie that I would watch over and over again like I do my other movies or would buy, but I liked it....I thought it would be more related to Christmas but it was more about a couple that had to figureout what they wanted as far as long term commitments but it was funny. Oh and also if you don't want your kids finding out about Santa notbeing real, don't let them see it, LOLcheck it out Its really just a comedy with a theme..."
148,"Im giving it a 6 because it made me burst into uncontrolled laughter on 3 occasions, especially the scenes with Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn where the ones that made me laugh, they were well made and well acted. The scene where Jon's character suddenly without warning hits Vince Vaughn's Character in the stomach was by far the best scene of the movie for me, it made burst into laughter, and afterwards left me craving for more, which I got only 5 minutes later when Vince's character comes out from the room after talking with his wife about setting boundaries. Also the scene with Jon Favreau and his Wife, in the guessing game was quite entertaining.I really cant see where all these negative comments are coming from, I personally was pleasantly surprised by the movie and I really enjoyed the first 2 quarters of the movie. The last 2 quarters were a bit boring and lacked comedic relief, especially the scenes with Reese Witherspoon were sometimes god awful, the scenes in the rubber jumping castle, were predictable and just very poorly acted, I mean I guess it was suppose to be a traumatizing child memory, but Reese really didn't seem to grasp this traumatized side of her character and that ruined the whole 10 minute sequence with her, and also killed a lot of my excitement for the movie. The ending and the last quarter was boring, the sequence from Vince character's moms house was the only uplifting moment until the end.Still a good movie, don't expect a whole lot of Christmas spirit if your going to watch it."
149,"Four Christmases is a movie I avoided for a while mainly because I'm tired of the whole Christmas type Comedy, they are becoming really redundant, but I love Reese Witherspoon so surely it couldn't have been that bad. There isn't one likable character in this movie, each one one of them all have their selfish tendencies, especially Vince Vaughn's whose character grated me to no end. I'm not a religious Christian or anything but I do believe in God, and I found some of the jokes very offensive, it's almost as if the Director couldn't stand God and cracked on him every chance he had. Witherspoon and Vaughn's chemistry is forced for starters and the only true laugh in the movie for me was at the start where they go and visit Duvall's family and Vaughn is setting up the satellite dish, I won't spoil it but it's pretty funny.Performances. Vince Vaughn is OK but to say his character is selfish is an understatement. The way he treated Reese in this film, I wanted to slap him on numerous occasions. Reese Witherspoon tries her best to be her usual charming self, but the script let's her down completely, she is better than this movie and I think she knows it. Robert Duvall looks bored with his character, and I didn't care for his character either. Sissy Spacek, Mary Steenburgen, Jon Voight,Jon Favreau, Dwight Yoakam, Tim McGraw make a great cast, but can do little with their respected parts. Kristin Chenoweth's character is annoying and despicable.Bottom line. I may be overly harsh with my evaluation of this movie to some, but I really did dislike this movie on a lot of levels. Christmas is supposed to be good-natured and fun, and while I enjoy devious humor, heck I even encourage it to go past the line, this was taking it way too far.4/10"
