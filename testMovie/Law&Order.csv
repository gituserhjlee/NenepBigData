0,"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is one of the best and most underrated shows on TV. It stars Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler, a tough-as-nails detective who makes his hatred of pedophiles and child molesters well known many times throughout the show. He has another side, a vicious side, that Criminal Intent's Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) lacks. I'm very pleased that he's been nominated for an Emmy. Mariska Hargitay won an Emmy for her performance as Olivia Benson, another fantastic detective. Benson has more edge than CI's Alex Eames (Kathrine Erbe), but is revered for her ability to communicate to troubled witnesses and gouge confessions out of suspects. Her life is put in danger at least twice a season, yet she continues to be strong. Next is the sarcastic detective Jon Munch, played by the excellent comedian Richard Belzer. Munch may seem annoying at times, but his ability to relate to witnesses is excellent, and he plays the ""good cop, bad cop"" role very well. The final detective is Finn Tutuola, played by former rapper Ice-T. Ice-T plays the character reasonably well, but I think we'd all like to see a meaner side of him. He was very good in the episodes entitled ""Rage,"" and ""Rooftop"". They are led by Don Cragen, played by Dann Florek, and Cragen is as good a captain as any, as Florek reprises his role he held on ""Law & Order"" for a few years. Adam Beach recently joined the show, bringing something new to the table in youth and his almost 'surfer dude' approach to detective work. The ADA now is Casey Novak, played by Diane Neal, who could be better, but she gets the job done. She's been better of late, and the contrast between her and her predecessor is really helpful to the show. Her predecessor, Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) was great also. The team is also aided by an FBI psychiatrist, George Huang (BD Wong), who aids them in finding out the true horrors of a person, witness or suspect. His best performance was in the episode called ""Coerced."" The members of this unit investigate sexually based crimes (rape, rape-homicide) and child based crimes (school shootings, child abuse, child molestation). The show has had extraordinary guest stars, from evil (Johnny Messner, Reg Flowers, Asio Highsmith, Jeff Kober) to touching (Leland Orser, Jerry Lewis) to lost (Brittany Snow) to famous and legendary actors (Jerry Lewis, Dean Cain, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Henry Winkler, Robin Williams, Matthew Modine, Alfred Molina, Cynthia Nixon, John Ritter). This is a truly great show that not only shows the line of work in this graphic department, but shows the emotional stress a detective goes through. 10/10"
1,I have never one been that big of a fan of the original Law & Order. I would watch it for time to time and it was an alright show but never really had anything jump out at me to make it one of my can't miss shows. Then this show came on. I watched this show when it premiered back in 1999 and was impressed from the get go. Sure it followed the basic premise of it's original cousin but was much more loose on it's format and execution. Some episodes hardly ever involve the court room at all where the original week in week out follows a distinct pattern. First half hour is the law then the next is the order. This show although does sometimes follow the same pattern like i mentioned it is much more loose in how it executes it. Mariska Hartigay is excellent as her portrayal of Det. Olivia Benson. The whole cast as a whole is magnificent. Now I know a lot of people will disagree with me that this show is in no way better than the original but for me it is. It has given me something that the original never did.
2,"Quality is the foundation that ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" is based upon. With compelling storylines, great performances and a first-rate cast; ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" radiates from the screen each hour it is on every night. Dick Wolf has combined quality writing with quality casting in the second of three series' in the ""Law & Order"" franchise.Mariska Hargitay, Christopher Meloni, Ice-T, Dann Florek, B.D. Wong and Richard Belzer all share one thing in common: they star in one of finest series on television.Mariska, Chris, Ice-T, Dann, B. D. and Stephanie March are a well-rounded cast that bring great depth to their characters and compliment each other very well. Furthermore, the cast portray their characters so well that I have to remind myself that they are actors not detectives.Quality writing and outstanding performances set ""Law And Order: SVU"" apart from the other dramas on television. Each episode is riveting, written with intelligence, and character driven. It is a privilege to watch ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.""The writers' ability to draw viewers in and make them care about the involving storylines and characters help to make ""Law & Order: SVU"" one of the finest legal series on television."
3,"When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.The thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.Also all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).The reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. 9 out of 10"
4,"Ok let's start by saying I use to love this show. However this new season that has come out 2017/2018 is absolutely ridiculous. It has so many political views and bs left/right motivation in it that it has lost me as a viewer. I don't even live in America, I'm Australian, I enjoyed it for what it was. ""Law"" and ""Order"" I enjoyed seeing the crime and then the person hopefully being punished for it. Now though, well according to the last episode I watched. 2/2/18. It would appear it has gone all political. I understand keeping with the times but its a law and order show, none of that stuff needs to be in it. Show some sort of rape/abuse etc and then the investigation and court proceedings like you have been doing since 1999, why bring all this alt left, alt right bs into now??? Personally I recommend skip anything new from this show and just go back to the original episodes where it was about the crime and solving it, not trying to push an agenda into your minds that in reality no one really cares about."
5,"After watching tonight's new season episode, I am thoroughly disappointed by the direction the show is taking. Tonight's 'ripped from the headlines' episode is an unnecessary and infuriating rehash of much of what has been wrong with 2020. With the last eight months being the most difficult time this country, not to mention the world, has known in most of our lifetimes, this episode seems like a feeble 'me too' and 'aren't we woke' attempt to be relevant."
6,"This used to be my favorite of the L&O franchise, until Stabler left. The last several seasons have done nothing but shamelessly pander to a political agenda, rather than focus on engaging plots, as they once did. It's regrettable that this show has become such a disappointment. It feels like I'm watching a sinking ship."
7,"I used to adore SVU, watched it religiously, but regretfully this series should have retired gracefully instead of giving us endlessly telenovela illogical plots, based on emotions and nothing to do with the law. Law and Order it certainly isn't."
8,"She's the executive producer, and now the ""executive actor."" She dominates every plot, every action, every aspect of the show. The rest of the cast has been reduced to less than minor roles. Moreover, this ruins the show's previous ""police accuracy."" ""Cragen"" ran the unit; Benson runs the unit, personally conducts the investigation and interviews, makes the arrest. Too much. The show needs to restore its balance."
9,"I hear on tv that apparently America's favorite Law and Order is the original. I personally think this is the best one out of all of them. It tackles some pretty intersting sides of society and humanity within an hour. I've been watching it for awhile and fell in love with the cast. They all have that hard edge that comes from doing a job like their's. Marishka is great and Ice-T is amusing. The storylines are very interesting and groundbreaking. In my classes, I've heard about the Down-Low phenomenon amongst black males in the U.S. This is the first show, aside from Oprah, that dealt with this issue. I was amazed and pleased that they'll take on any topic within their framework. Their guest cast should be praised as well. They have a great casting director. I don't know about their history with Emmy nominations, but they should definitely be in the running. The show has a very easy going nature despite the hardness of the cast that works well and acted beautifully.  It gives a real look at society's imperfections and discriminatory ideologies. Nobody on the show is perfect and even the lawyers manipulate the law beyond the usual scope people think they do. Instead, they are manipulating it to see justice done and not avoided. I would urge anyone to watch this show. Give it a look."
10,"Leave the left partinship out of it. I want to be entertained when I turn off the news, not watch a scripted make-believe version of an op-ed."
11,"The acting is haphazard, the characters are one dimensional and loathsome, and the writing is predictable and trashy. I hate this show so much, the only reason I joined IMDb was to communicate to the world how odious this show is. Please, if it is remotely within your capacity, take this show off the air. If you have a positive view of the world, of humanity, the government, or the criminal justice system, do not watch this show. It not only communicates the sensationalized myth of the need for fear, but it also depicts public officials as sinister, self- righteous villains for whom if violence could ever be justified, it would be justified against the characters portrayed as protagonists in this show."
12,This show is such a disapointment-political agenda and neverending pans of the characters faces mostly good old mariska and tired understanding feel good dialogue-it used to be a great cop show now it should be shown about two oclock in the afternoon with the rest of the soap operas.
13,Another crime show that is being ruined by propagandistic infiltration.
14,"I started watching this on Netflix as a binge show. I fell in love with the original cast from the beginning. Stabler kept Benson in check, and Capt. Kragen kept them both in check. Then comes season 11 (i think it was) that ends with Stabler shooting the kid in their squad room. So no more stable to keep Benson on track. Then one of the best characters retires - Sgt. Munch. and the show needs a new Sgt. so who else but Benson gets it. Oh and then Kragen retires, and now they need a new leader, so obviously, this show is now The Olivia Benson show. It's stopped being about the SVU, it's now a drama about Benson. Her kidnapping, her torture, her adoption, etc.They need to get back on track and involve the rest of the cast more, like they used to do. This 1 man (or woman rather) team of Olivia Benson and her wishy washy law enforcement is getting really old. I finally made it through season 20, I'm finding it very hard to make myself start watching Season 21"
15,Used to tune into law and order every now and then growing up. Tuning into the newer seasons has ceased secondary to the blatenetly obvious bash course it chooses to take in all conservative values whilst pushing leftist garbage. No thanks and no thanks.
16,I watched SVU a lot before but now it's just soap all the way. Just sad to watch really.
17,"I used to love this show but now it is just so far fetched, asinine or far left liberal storylines that it is just no longer enjoyable to watch. I think it has over stayed it's welcome."
18,"I have watched every episode, and I have been disappointed to see more politically charged episodes during the last 4 seasons. They clearly take sides, and they end up being disrespectful and undermining the very difficult jobs of law enforcement agencies including the police and ICE. I will not watch another season."
19,"I watch SVU from beginning, even though I liked the original Law and Order better. But since CPT cragen retired and Olivia Benson assumed as lutenant, show took a wrong turn and there's no law nor order in the show. It's just all about left-wing political bs all the time, and feminism, and all that crap.
Should've retired the show gracefully.
Now it's just another show starring a boring, delusional SJW who sees bad in everything (oh Olivia, what have they done to you?!) and about political correctness and all that bs.
0/10 nowadays.
Not for our surprise, the ratings from law and order SVU are dropping hard."
20,"This show has gone consistently WAY downhill since Stabler left. What I really dislike about it now is that everything seems to revolve around Olivia. Her character portrays herself as a saint, week after painful week predictably fighting for the victim in this annoying holier-than-thou temperament. It's the same lines over and over and over and over: To the victims: ""You didn't do anything wrong."" ""You""ll feel better if you testify and stand up to your rapist."" ""You have nothing to be ashamed of,"" etc. ad nauseam. In every courtroom scene: Cut to Olivia in the gallery with the same four expressions on her face: anger, disgust, fear, shock. Since when did a Captain have that much time to spend in court? And forget about court, when did a Captain ever have that much time to spend each case one-on-one with a victim? Ever since Hargitay became executive producer this series has pathetically revolved around her. When Christopher Meloni was on the show it was more of an ensemble cast. Or at least it felt like one. Now everyone just goes to Olivia. They have no personalities except as they relate to her. Sometimes I don't even know why I keep watching because it's so painfully predictable. And don't get me started on the forced, and in my opinion, unnecessary storyline with her son Noah. Why does he have to pop-up all the time? The kid is not even a compelling actor, and adds nothing to each episode except...oh I know...to show Olivia's growth. See, again...all about her. This is a police procedural. Keep it that way and let's not have family issues getting in the way of serious rape cases. Also, every show must have a bold, in-your-face statement and lesson, as evidenced by a recent episode where protesters were standing outside the courtroom holding signs supporting a victim. We get it. #MeToo is front and center these days, but don't preach to me. So why do I keep watching? Well, my husband and I finished last weeks episode and I looked at him and said, ""Let's just be done with this travesty of a show and take it off our Hulu list because all we do is groan and moan and interrupt like the robots on Mystery Science Theater 3000."" And he turned to me and said, ""We've come this far, we may as well watch it out until the end."" I just may leave him to it. Without me."
21,"I don't know why they had to start making this show so political? I use to love this show. Last season (2017) I almost gave up on it, but pushed to the end hoping they would give us an evening of entertainment instead of putting our minds right back on the problems we are watching TV to forget about for a few minutes. They can't seem to do it anymore. They lose the crime plot now for the political plot. Not the kind of show I like to watch. It you do then you will love it. For me I am no longer watching the show."
22,"Quality is the foundation that ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" is based upon as it illuminates from the screen each hour it is on every night.Dick Wolf has combined quality writing with quality casting.

EVERYONE MUST WATCH."
23,"In the dictionary of American TV jargon, this show is featured next to the phrase, ""Jumped the shark"". Here's why:The last episode of the current season--Benson and the ADA (don't remember her name) perform a surgical procedure on the Medical Examiner while she's conscious and directing them, screeching in alleged pain, after the M.E. been shot in the chest.Get real.This travesty is clearly aiming for syndication on the Lifetime channel or Oxygen. Better to kill it off now and put us out of our misery.Richard Belzer and Ice-T ought to have their own spin off show, but a comedy this time-- they'd be much more at home. This is not to say that they're not good at their craft, but simply that they've been given such wretched material over the run of the show. I could see them in their own ""buddy cop"" show--I might even watch it. The rest of them can rot in syndication, and Dann Florek can keep doing his gold commercials--apparently what he's paid for them has ""never been worth zero"". Unfortunately, this show has outlived its usefulness.January 2012: I can't believe I'm writing this. Harry Connick Jr. has joined the cast as an ""Executive Assistant to the DA"". Isn't ""Executive Assistant"" an overpaid secretary? The first thing that sprang to mind after I saw him in character on screen was ""Elvis movie"". As a huge fan of Harry Connick's music, I am equally disappointed in his choice to take on this role. Stiff and stumbling don't even begin to describe it. Stick to jazz, Harry."
24,"Each episode is now about the personal liberal views of the cast. I remember a day when it was creative or mirrored real life events. It's too bad, I used to like this show."
25,This was an amazing show when it had a bigger ensemble cast. Now its less than a handful of regulars?!?!!! Just not as good as it used to be.
26,"SVU used to be one of my favourite shows. There's been some incredible, edge-of-your-seat episodes like ""911"", but now it's mostly he-said she-said's and statutory rapes between two willing participants (i.e. 15 year old girl and 16 year old guy). Yes, it's more realistic and true to life, but that's not why I watch TV like this. If I wanted realistic crime shows I'd watch Highway Cops or something - not Law & Order.The political agenda pushing that's become central to the show is beyond aggravating. As the most liberal, feminist, pro-immigration, anti-racist, anti-fascist person around, having the views I already believe in forced down my throat every time I'm trying to chill out and watch TV is frustrating. It's also even more frustrating knowing how pointless it is - SVU is a crime show, it's not going to make anyone reconsider their politics, and it's dumb to isolate people from a show they've enjoyed for decades just because their politics differ to yours. The way it's all approached feels really patronising and tacky too - and the ""my way is the right way"" attitude is unhelpful in creating any positive political discussion.Season 19 has been better than the past few seasons - there's been a few more engaging plot lines. It's still not even close to how it used to be though, where virtually every episode was an 8/10 with 9's being a common occurrence. Now it's more like every episode is a 5/10, and we're lucky if we get a 7.I don't watch the show regularly anymore; I just resort to it when there's literally nothing else I can think of to watch. It sucks because it was so good, and I don't even think the new cast is too bad (yeah, they're not the OG's, but I can deal with it if the plots are good). It seemed to get a lot worse when Mariska Hargitay took over as Executive Producer.Bring back engaging plots please and stop the political tripe. :("
27,"My how this TV crime/drama series has deteriorated over the past several years to only surviving on its great reputation from a decade earlier of Emmy winning seasons. Now the show in its tired 20th season has fallen to a new low.The series should be renamed the ""Mariska Hartigay Show"" with the opening theme song being the old Mary Tyler Show theme song. Remember that theme songs lyrics? Let me recite the first paragraph of the Mary Tyler theme song and you tell me if it doesn't remind you of Olivia Benson's current overbearing role on Law and Order. So here we go.......
Who can turn the world on with her smile?
Who can take a nothing day, and suddenly make it all seem worthwhile?
Well it's you girl (Olivia Benson), and you should know it
With each glance and every little movement you show itblah blah blah and on Olivia Benson goes, she is the Captain, she is the prime field detective oozing over with phony empathy for the victims, and she is also the soft spoken loving mom of her adoptive son Noah. Olivia, Olivia, Olivia, give it up already. PLEASE!This series is done my friends!!! So sad and sorry to say but it has become nothing more than a vain attempt by Mariska Hartigay to ensure her face is the ONLY face of the 20th season of Law & Order SVU. Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!I have dropped my original series rating from an envious 9 to a deplorable 2."
28,Once was an alright show. Now it's all political. Nothing but liberal rhetoric. Stopped watching after last season. All the storylines are repetitive. Terrible writing. Nothing to hold the viewers interest. Time to archive SVU. Maybe future generations will dig this out of the scrap pile and wonder why in the world anyone would waste their time watching this garbage.
29,"I have just finished watching the 2-hour season finale of this show. It will be the last time I watch this series. This show was, for many years, a solid police drama, focusing on bringing attention to the horrors of various kinds of sexual violence; and the hard work of the police to bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice. Over the past few seasons, it has become increasingly dominated by scripts which continuously push the liberal agenda down the throats of the audience. It is no longer entertainment with a strong message that every American can accept. It is pure liberal propaganda, like so much of the trash coming out of the ""entertainment"" industry today. ABC leads the parade for this kind of preaching; but NBC is gaining on them; and this show is one of the worst. Week after week the permanent cast is shoving liberal talking points at us; showing us how ""wrong"" we are if we don't openly and blindly accept transsexuals, illegal aliens, killers and rapists who were abused as children, all Muslims, and every other liberal excuse for a human being that walks the planet. Well, NBC, you have every right to your opinion on such matters. But you are violating the concept of ""entertainment"" when you push your beliefs at me, and expect me to accept is as such. I'm done with this show; and I'm dropping a lot of other shows across all networks this year as your industry continues to attack MY beliefs, and blatantly shove YOUR beliefs at me in your scripts. I hope that many Americans will also recognize your disgusting propaganda, and stop watching your network!"
30,"L&O: SVU is by far the worst of the L&O franchise, and one of the worst shows ever to appear on TV, any network, any language: It suffers from the late-MASH syndrome, where all minor characters have to have a part and are all buddy-buddy. The writers can't use jargon without immediately defining its social meaning. Benson: ""He's a pedophile."" Ice-T: ""Yeah, 32% of pedophiles rape kids under 8, yo, word.""Mariska Hargitay has one basic expression: shocked horror. And what's with Benson's one cure-all for everything? Talk therapy. No, dear, some things should be bottled up and never spoken of again.They have something in for prep kids. What, was Dick Wolf turned down by the Philip Exeter Academy or something?It's a bizarre combination of far-left socializing plus far-right tactics, yielding an overall effect eerily reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution in China.Why is Richard Belzer on this show? Munch was a great character on Homicide. They don't write to either his character or the actor's capabilities at all.Are these cops supposed to be NYPD cops?! *NEW YORK?* Playing social worker? No. New York cops solve crimes, they don't play social worker. Victims are chumps, perps are prey. Bizarre.Where is the real ""SVU"" horror of the welfare mom in a roach-infested hovel starving the kids while hubby rapes them? It's an incredibly ""clean"" show."
31,All of the other Law & Order shows have had realistic cast changes except this one. It is the same old same old. Benson and Stabler go running around and grab the wrong person. Benson always looks like she smells rotten fish and Stabler roughs up the suspect. They catch the wrong person within the first 15 minutes and then the real person strikes again. Benson stands slack jawed with her tongue poking out of her mouth and Stabler looks insulted that he arrested the wrong person.They are never held accountable for their mistakes and cop and attitude that they were wrong. The writing got so predictable a few years back.Maybe I am just sick of seeing that face of Benson and Stabler all the time. It is funny... in the first season one of the characters makes a comment that because the job in SVU is so stressful that they have to rotate out after 2 years to keep their sanity. It stuck with me because I thought they were setting things up for frequent cast changes... BOY WAS I WRONG. I stories were interesting but not in the last couple of years. I miss the show when it was good.
32,"This is absolutely the best cop show on TV. There's less time in the court room and more with the detectives, which I enjoy. I think there needs to be more time with the detectives off the job. My favorite detective is Olivia Benson, the child of a rape who is played by Mariska Hargitay.Olivia is one of those detectives who would be really awesome if you knew her well, but you wouldn't want to get on her bad side. She is also very stubborn. She and Elliot Stabler (a family man played by Christopher Meloni) make a great team. Christopher and Mariska are great actors.  I often forget that these are actors, not real people. I think Olivia should have a boyfriend. It might help her stop being so stubborn. This is just the best cop show ever to be on TV and I hope it stays on for a long time."
33,I used to love this show first 10 seasons are so were great. Since Christopher Meloni left the character of Olivia Benson has become almost unbearable. She has lost whatever charm she used to possess. It's time for this show to end.
34,"After years of watching this show, we decided (after watching less than half of the first episode of the 2020 season) that we're done! We watch TV to relax and get away for the 24 hour news cycle. My blood pressure was up 10 minutes into this show!! Delete, delete, delete.......... When will Hollywood learn?"
35,"I really and truly use to love to tune into this show every week. This whole season(and last season to be honest) has done nothing but push liberal propaganda down our throats!! Must everything be political??!! Dick Wolf should start every episode with ""I hate Trump"" and ""I hate Christians"" Each episode is now geared feeling sorry for Muslims and hate crimes against them or Christians are crazy loons. I am serious!! Anyway..this loyal viewer was just lost. Turning the channel."
36,"Back when Law & Order: Special Victims Unit was truly an ensemble show, it was excellent. Each week would focus mostly on one character - the best episodes being the Munch-centric ones - showing us a case from beginning to end.Then the show became the star making vehicle for mediocre ""actress"" Mariska Hargitay. Every week now we're treated to her wooden acting and Olivia's constant whining. ""I'm the product of rape! I have a political opinion and I'm going to shove it down your throat! I'm going to cry over nothing! I'm going to be kissed by a woman!"" Hargitay has so little acting talent she makes Paris Hilton look like Merle Streep. Yet every week we have to see her character poach a case from the far superior Finn or Munch, then we're have to put up with The Benson & Stabler Prime Time Whining Hour. If it's not Olivia whining, then it's Stabler and his unnecessary family problems. Munch and Finn whom have much more chemistry and Richard Belzer & Ice-T have a ton more acting talent then Hargitay, get shoved to just next to non-speaking extras.Of course Christopher Meloni's acting is not all that stellar either. Though he did improve when partnered with better actors and actresses.Perhaps if the producers get their heads out of their tuchuses and fired the talentless Hargitay the show would improve. They also need to stop with shoving their political opinions down the viewers throats. But mostly fire the wooden Hargitay and make more Munch & Finn centric episodes. Also a few Cragen centric."
37,"Same old story every week ...""rape""... Rape victims aren't the only... ""special victims""... With all the money the show supposedly reels in from sponsors, you'd think that they could possibly tap into something other than rape. They once said that they take real world situations and put their own spin on them. In the real world, more than rape happens, and there are special victims created because of them."
38,"I still do not like the character of Olivia Benson being in charge of SVU as she is not good at it at all as she strictly is all for the females every time as far as victims go but then she doesn't trust or get totally along with Rollins maybe she sees her as a threat or something because Rollins sees & hears both sides males & females. They need to bring in somebody else to be in charge of SVU & bust Benson back down to just being a detective. The last & latest episode I'm on the fence or almost over the fence because the ""victim"" liked the guy when she first seen him telling her cousin he is hot & then the whole bathroom scene & other witnesses from the party said she was all over him even as they went outside. I do not think it warrants rape. Also in this episode Benson makes it sound like before we have sex every time we have to ask permission & wait for a firm definitive yes or no whether it's our wife or girlfriend or whomever & that way off point & wrong. Rape is or should be when somebody says no or is fighting you off while at the same time the perp doesn't care what the female is saying & forces it on her anyway."
39,"In the past I liked it often, with the New York dark side and continuous relevant references, though of course solving every crime with the right culprit was always hard to bare. But now I'd say please ignore the worst police shows ever.In the first episode of season 17 they took their story from Silence of the Lambs, with a psychopath that is willing to give information for benefits and only wants to meet the girl... Even the transvestite reference resembles Buffalo Bill, the transvestite psychopath wanting to be a woman, AM I THE ONLY ONE WHO NOTICED THIS? They keep putting at least 5 cops on every small case including the lieutenant who has less tasks than a hot-dog vendor, while she constantly keeps hovering above the one investigation, SHE DOES NOT HAVE MORE THAN ONE CASE! This many cops does not compensate for cheap story lines, a soapy soundtrack and this fluffy story about crime on planet earth. I can't watch this anymore, nor can most people that can think, cancel this show already!"
40,This has metastasise by season 18. It was supposed a series about police and legal procedures but it turned out to be preaching with seriously unbelievable plots that basically pushing social agenda instead of showing things as they are in factual sense. Sad end to a great concept. No need to watch anymore.
41,"Show was great with cragen in charge, and even when Olivia became lutenant in the beginning
But now they made her views so extreme. She is always crying, and over-dramatic, and every female in the series IS, no matter what, a victim to her and to Carisi aswel
The serie, one of the most liked by me, is pretty much ruined by that.
Don't watch it anymore on regular basis, specially the new episodes. Now I only watch the old ones ."
42,"This show used to be good. If you watch it now, I'll give you a hint. The white male did it."
43,"The show has never been good since the character Elliot left the show. The character Olivia is old, comes across brass, manly at times. Her weight fluctuates terribly season to season. The Olivia character has not been enjoyable to watch since the character Elliot left the show, sh3 seemed to perform better with Elliot than she does by herself. I no longer watch the show.
👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎. 10 thumbs down out of 10."
44,"First: And there is only one reason why I don't say that about CI(Criminal Intent) and that is because they do not offer D'Onofrio's partner, Katherine Erbe, some juicier involvement. Otherwise, I believe that both SVU and CI are the best in crime shows on TV.CSI/CSI Miami has nothing on the wonderful grittiness, the compelling stories and the fabulous acting in both programs.After every show, I let the breath I have been holding since the beginning of the hour. This programs pulls me through the ringer in so many ways not always mentioned, the legal implications of decisions made by the police, captains, the doctor, forensics, the ADAs, legal counsels and that horribly bitchy Judge Petrofsky.Some of the stories contain conventional crime stories, but more than is normally frequent, the stories contain rather important issues, moral, psychological and legal.So many good shows, this is the best crime show on TV."
45,"Law and Order SVU was a staple show the wife and I looked forward to each week.
The key work here is ""was"". Now it's 2019/2020 and the same thing is happening to this once great TV show as to so many other shows and movies.We have been watching this show out of inertia from the many previous years we had spent watching it. 15mins in to the last several episodes the wife is napping, and I'm trying not to cringe/laugh at this serious drama. The wife wakes up once in awhile to ask what is happening, I grunt ""show said, all men not good, stupid"", she drifts off back to sleep.Go watch the earlier seasons, stay away from this new tripeWe now have a new slot available for a different tv show in our limited tv time."
46,"You would think that the writers of this liberal hog wash could come up with a better story line or something but NO, it's the SOS just wrapped up in a bigger, thicker, fuller bag of ....Now they just push the #Liberal nonsense harder and harder, could be that it takes place in NYC where there are so many clueless & crazy liberals to begin with...Tired of this show, Happy 20th years, hoping it's your last."
47,"I don't really have anything to say; read George Orwell's essay on ""No Orchids for Miss Blandish"" and discover why it's all been said before, better than I could say it.Obviously the show is cruddy enough on aesthetic grounds: I don't know whether to blame the wooden acting or the 100%-exposition dialogue, so let's blame both. But people are willing to overlook such things on TV in the interests of fantasy. I am too. What's depressing is that people are willing to overlook the lousiness of the production in the interests of what they're really getting out of the show: the chance to watch the hounds chase the fox for an hour, until the latter collapses of exhaustion.What's also depressing is that this show is part of a trend. In the past, a leading-up-to-the-trial kind of TV show would have focused on the defence lawyers; it's a shame that we're now getting a kick out of siding with the prosecution, especially when it's this bunch of deeply unpleasant people.Perry Mason didn't have a mean streak."
48,"This is the BEST show! Mariska Hargitay (Detective Olivia Benson) and Christopher Meloni (Detective Elliot Stabler) are great for the 2 parts and work so well together. The cases are based on real cases and if I didn't know they are all actors i'd say it IS real. The show is my inspiration for wanting to join the NYPD sex crimes. I recently found out about sex crimes in my home town (San Diego, CA). I want to intern there before I go to NYC and join.I have learned a lot about law and all that from the show. There was an episode about FAS (Fetal Alcoholic Syndrome) which became my topic for my health project. In general I learned about law and prosecution and it is a great show to watch! 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, EXCELLENT!"
49,"I used to watch this on netflix. I decided to skip ahead a few seasons and see what's going on in the later seasons (last year or 2). Wow. It has become so liberal, and so ""#metoo"" and the Lt. Benson character has become totally unbelievable - that character needs to go. I am not going to watch anymore. It's garbage now."
50,Law and order svu was one of the best police drama series for years. now that season 20 has begun I had to make myself watch all 3 episode while asking Mother Mary for help to make it thru. I love the cast but it is time to end ..this are the worse storylines ever. I mean they are digging deep to fill an hour episode with nothing but trash...SVU sorry but it's time to turn the light off and leave the station!!
51,This was an incredible show. Now it's just BS. What a shame. Stopped watching. Won't ever watch again. Nothing but liberal trash.
52,"I just finished watching ""Turmoil"" and I am aghast that those two have not been drummed out by the IAD. That squad has lost more detectives to ""bad"" behavior yet Stabler, especially him, continues to lose his mind and all manner of control in every situation, make terrible judgment calls and is basically a ticking time bomb every week. And can we figure out how to write some kind of dialogue that is appropriate to the job? Calling child rapists scumbags went the way of NYPD Blue and grossly inadequate. And can we stop nominating Mariska Hartigay for Emmys and Golden Globes? She's got only one expression that she uses for when she's confused by the evidence, taking a witness statement or placating ""El"" when he's gone off the deep end. I don't know why I continue to watch this freaking show. This is has gone the way of CSI:Miami. Straight up parody."
53,"I started out liking this. But by season 5, it started to go very idiotic and on a warpath against religion. It is also full of ridiculous lines and plots.In the episode ""Popular"" (which was among the last that I watched), they are discussing a 13-year-old girl who was allegedly raped; Benson says she wants to check out mom and dad because ""the father seemed very upset about his daughter having sex."" Well, duh! ANY parent would be upset at a 13-year-old having sex! How ridiculous!!! (It's a shame; I do like this episode, mainly because I like Ned Luke; but that was a ridiculous thing to say; obviously the one who wrote it must not have a daughter of any age). In ""Slaves"" Benson points out; ""She's not even his real daughter. She's adopted."" Now THAT is a serious insult to ALL adopted children, including myself. I am just as much this family's daughter as blood. DNA alone does not make a family. Love does. Then, the writers have the audacity to write in (a few seasons later) that Benson was planning to adopt, but was denied. Serious hypocritical behavior for a woman who says that an adopted child is not the ""real"" son/daughter! I am now planning to adopt and I will treat that child no different than if I did indeed have her/him. Get a clue, people!!!In several episodes, paramedics will say things like ""it's likely he'll die"" or ""they will never walk again."" My brother is a paramedic. They do NOT diagnose, do NOT determine if you will live or die, do NOT say things about possible disabilities you will have. The DOCTORS do the actual diagnosing. Paramedics are NOT doctors. They transport you to the doctors and the docs do the rest.Episode ""Competence"" was the worst ever! Whoever wrote this should be ashamed! First, NOBODY at all takes care of a baby all alone! There are many many many disabled women who are even SINGLE mothers!!! As a disabled person myself, I was INSULTED by this!!! Are you going to say that I cannot be a mother? I do like Andrea Faye Friedman and Lois Smith, but this episode was complete stupidity!!! Episode ""Coerced"" was badly thought out during the rescue of the missing boy. They are searching for a missing boy in an abandoned boarded-up building. They tell him to bang on something and you hear metallic banging, like a pipe hitting another. When they locate the boy, his hands are tied behind his back and there is no pipe next to him that he could have used to bang on something. As far as religion is concerned, the show cops (in real life, I say ""police"" out of respect) deal with extremists or cultists and not actual religious people. Benson often says ""I blame religion."" Only extremists and cultists feel the need to kill (or harm) the people they believe are in the wrong. TRUE Christians believe that we pray for them! Christianity does NOT ever condone violence! We do NOT just pray and do nothing. We pray and take action and believe that God guides us! I wish these writers would at least research! There are many differences between a religion and a cult. Religion is about guiding the people. Cults are about control. Ever notice they never bad-mouth scientology idiots? Plus, TRUE Christians do not just pray and do nothing. We pray and then take action. We believe that God guides us, not does everything for us. I have been dealing with a condition since I was aged two. My family, religious, prayed AND followed doctor's instructions and made sure that I took my medications. This is what real Christians do. We believe that God granted people the intelligence to learn, research, and use that research to our benefit. Why would God grant humans such intelligence if He didn't expect us to use it? It is the extremists that refuse medical attention. But the people who make this show just refuse to get that and they put real religion in the same category as cults and extremists.I detest the new detectives intently. That blonde woman (cannot remember her name) is a lousy actor. Why not bring back Dani Beck? I actually liked her. Instead they give us a lame actor and lame character.SVU deals not only with sex crimes. They deal with ANY crime against a child. ANY. Children are considered special victims.There are almost no new surprises anymore. ""Oh no; he's really a woman!"" ""Oh no; she's really a man!"" ""Oh he's really a pedophile!"" Same old, same old.Why do ALL the children and young girl/boy characters have the SAME names? It's ALWAYS Henry, Molly, Sophie, and Katie! Where are the REAL names, such as Stephanie? Or Travis? Or Trevor? Or Charlotte? I hate these ""cutesy"" name being used all the damn time. The only ones I watch now are the ones that guest-starred Naveen Andrews, Ned Luke (except ""Surrender Dorothy""), and Jeremy Irons.Finally, Mariska Hargitay has the most ridiculous haircut. Does she know how awful she looks? I cannot stand looking at that haircut that looks like she cut it with a weed-whacker.I will stay with the ORIGINAL ""Law & Order""! That was (and still is) the best ever crime-drama TV series!"
54,"Around 2000, Law & Order had become one of the longest-running television shows based on a fictional premise, although it still has a long way to go in order to catch up with the record holders. Such was the continued popularity of the series that creator Dick Wolf saw a market for a spin-off, and was obviously glad to oblige. Hence, over ten years after Law & Order burst onto the airwaves, Special Victims Unit was born, so to speak.Of course, the show had a little problem finding its feet at first. This is only natural, even for a series spun off from a successful formula. The challenges Special Victims Unit faced included a major deviation from the normal Law & Order structure. The segment dealing with the trials of suspects was dispensed with, emphasising for the most part the efforts of the detectives to bring victims a sense of justice. As the series progressed, work with a District Attorney began to find its way into the plots, but in a manner more complementary to the work of the detectives.As in any series, the key ingredient is finding sympathetic leads that the audience can relate to. Where the original Law & Order eventually found solid ground in the form of Jerry Orbach, Special Victims Unit more or less got this element right from the start. Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni play so well off one another that it is certainly going to make life difficult for the unlucky actors who get to replace them. Another side benefit of the reduction in emphasis on the legal dealings is that we get to see more of the personal lives of the detectives, without them necessarily having to be worked into the plot. Every now and again, insight into the impact the job has on Stabler's family life in particular is offered, and it works wonderfully.The fundamental weakness in Special Victims Unit to date has been the supporting cast. Richard Belzer's schtick can get tiring, but adds the ironic comic touch (delivered so brilliantly by Orbach in the original series), which Meloni seems incapable of delivering. One has to wonder, however, whose bright idea it was to cast Ice-T as a replacement for one of the early detectives, as no matter how hard he tries to sound the part, one cannot believe him as a detective. Especially not one in this particular squad. The relative underdevelopment of most of the support characters does not help.Another challenge faced with every episode of Law & Order in any form is to come up with cases interesting enough to grab the attention. The original series is faltering slightly on this score, but when it does succeed, it succeeds enough to more than make up for all the average stories. Special Victims Unit, on the other hand, sets a consistent level for each episode. Because of the extreme nature of the crimes being investigated, they each become alike for the most part. It is the little details that make the big difference. This is, of course, a much better deal than the other spin-off, where the stories are consistent in how uninteresting they are.In all, Special Victims Unit is a well worthy follow-up to the original Law & Order. It is not recommended for sensitive viewers, but as an insight into the lot of those who have to clean up the mess in one of the modern world's most sexually violent societies, it works brilliantly. It even has potential to get better."
55,I love the SVU series. I'm watching every episode from the beginning. It helps me so much to think about something other than my cancer pain. So thank you for saving me from that!
56,"I use to watch the series and gave up on it during Season 13 when Elliot was no longer on the show. But a few months ago I decided to give it another try when I saw that the entire series including current season, is on Hulu. although I do like some of the new characters, it's not the same without Elliot. The show use to be decent but now it's a waste of time.. Two things; The show is centered around Olivia. Which seems absurd given the fact that she's not that great anymore, at least not great enough to be constantly centered on her, and there are other characters worthy of the spotlight. But one thing that gets really tiring is Olivia crying literally almost every episode. I imagine early on it was something she was praised for but now it's just way too much even annoying at times. Some episodes it's 2 or 3 times. Give it a rest already. And the episode where she was told Elliot wasn't coming back she had to go in another room and sob and hyper ventilate. It was too much of a scene for what happened. Her crying is over the top, overrated and overexposed. It has also gotten too political , and has a clear far left agenda. And I call fake post on the reviews that are raving about what a great show it is. The wording is obviously just to combat the negative reviews. And the ""so healing"" reviews are just as fake. Yes the characters say they are rape victim advocates, but there's nothing at all therapeutic about the show that would be considered healing. It's someones lame job to come on here and post good reviews."
57,"What is going on with television this Fall? People watch shows like Law and Order to take them away from daily routines and drama. Always loved this show UNTIL last week. Why oh why must you inject your obvious political bias against our current President's policies? News flash ... about half of the people in the United States LIKE his policies. SO decide what's more important...continuing on with a long-running exceptional show, or turn people off with your biased storylines. Show BOTH sides of things or lose long time viewers."
58,"Although this started out as a promising show, a better title for what it quickly became would be ""Law & Order: Liberal Lecture Hour"". Each episode of the show is a transparent allegory or a direct presentation of some liberal crusade in which the dialogue completely focuses on the detectives, lawyers, clerks, victims, and random passers-by reciting some left-wing diatribe. At first they had the decency to at least include a cardboard cut-out of a figure to respond to these arguments. Now they don't even bother with that; it's a straight lecture, complete with occasional raps on the knuckles with a ruler for not caring as much as these fictional characters obviously do.Many times the stories won't even involve 'special victims'. The writer might throw in some crime that at first appears to be under their jurisdiction, but this will quickly be discovered to be false. Yet the detectives just care so much (and so should you!) about the tenuously tangential political/social issue that they are compelled to make it their crusade. And laughably they are always able to secure some meaningless, fictional victory over it by the end of the show.If that's not enough to drive you away, there's one other major problem with this series: the completely overbearing and ridiculous way the show worships Mariska Hargitay. Not only is her character completely preposterous - she has, in turn, been a cop, a detective, a computer crimes investigator/hacker, an undercover agent with the FBI (while making sure not to insult the hippies she's spying on, and making a point about police brutality), and so on - but also has an overbearing, sanctimonious back story and has to be told she's ""beautiful"" every third show. It becomes really preposterous when she decides to take one of her many vacations; while she's gone the show does nothing but mourn her absence, complete with shoulders-up close-up static scenes of her randomly inserted into stories so we won't go into deep withdrawal.Chris Meloni doesn't fare very well in a role that has been almost entirely phased out. He was originally the 'muscle', but left-wingers don't like muscle, so now he's morphed into kind of a touchy-feely, whiny crybaby who pines for his cardboard cut-out of a wife and family and apparently feels bad for being the necessary tough guy. His role is unintentionally hilarious because the makers of the show have no idea what to do with him. They want a tough guy so people who like cop shows will watch (because enforcing the law requires tough guys), but if they make him too tough they'll lose the left-wing audience who likes the sermons and thinks violence is icky. So one show he'll punch a guy, and the next show he's in therapy for it. There's an episode where he takes down a combative perp using a choke hold - the only action sequence in the show - and is then castigated for the rest of the episode for 'excessive force'. On the ridiculous 'Abu Ghraib' episode they had him utter the completely laughable lie that he had ""used force"" to compel a confession, but ""9 times out of 10 is was counterproductive"". Makes one long for the halcyon days of Andy Sipowicz.The rest of the cast are increasingly irrelevant, pencil-sketch background characters. Though there have been abortive attempts to flesh some of them out, they're almost entirely ignored except to occasionally throw in a line representing their one dimension of characterization. Is there a pimp in this story? Bring in Ice-T! Does anybody use the word 'conspiracy' in this one? Bring in Belzer! And there's usually not much courtroom drama in an episode - the cops generally browbeat the audience for at least 45 minutes, minus the occasional chase scene - so we generally only see the pretty ADA give her speech. Which always reflects the lecture we've been given all episode and comes to the obvious conclusion: everybody who doesn't agree with the left-wing point of view on the issue is evil and should be in prison. But not executed! They're against that.So basically if you want to worship at the temple of Hargitay, believe everything sent to you in an email by MoveOn.org and love the Daily Show, and think the best entertainment is to hear your own opinion regurgitated to you based upon the latest opinion poll, this is your show. If you think Hargitay looks a little mannish, actually want to see a good cops/lawyers show, or find trite presentations of important issues tiresome, there's better to be found."
59,This show was good years ago now it have become on the side of illegals. And very political. Also Mariska it has become a show about her which has become boring! I have taken it off of my DVR!
60,"I watched the original one - all thru the 20 episodes - in real time (& then any number of times more). I was a big fan of this one, by default, but what the hail happened?! It's the OLIVIA BENSON show!! And, UGH: Could you be ANY MORE OBVIOUS about inserting your socio-political ideals and agendas?! Oh, yeah...so hubby noticed one time (maybe about season 16) that Maritska Hargitay is the producer of many of these later seasons...NO WONDER it's now the OLIVIA BENSON Show! *BARF* How many freaking sharks do you have (to try) to jump before you realize IT'S OVER, PEOPLE?Get THE HAIL off your high horses & CLEAR political agendas!!"
61,I'm watching this on Netflix and started on the 13th season. With just watching this season I feel that this show showcases how corrupt police departments can be. The detectives have lied on the stand and make up bogus charges so that they can frame people they think deserve to be in jail with no evidence. The detectives believe every case is a holy war and believe that their opinion is all that matters without any supporting evidence. They even try to tell the defense teams that they shouldn't put up a fight or even defend them because we are right even though we don't have evidence. In one episode the male detective claims a gun was on the scene yet there was no evidence of one and the other detective claimed there never was one. The next scene the male detective is upset at his partner because she refused to lie for him on the stand. The detectives are only out for their own opinions and don't give care about justice.
62,"This series is painful to watch.  ""Oz"" and ""Homicide"" alumni wander around aimlessly through endless, boring tripod shots, looking confused and with little to do. Inappropriate music cues intended to accentuate suspenseful scenes destroy the tension instead.  The dialogue lacks all subtext.  Much time is wasted on the uninteresting personal lives of the characters, further dampening tension.  Figures from the original series appear far too frequently to give the show some much needed juice, but in vain; were it not for their presence, I would be inclined to ignore this show entirely, but using them to breath life into this corpse weakens their impact on their own series (especially when 'surrogate' characters empowered by them behind the scenes arrive, only to use said powers inappropriately), leading me to deride it in this manner.  Worst of all, the show focuses entirely on the work of the detectives, when the defining characteristic of it's parent was the separation of powers between detectives and district attorneys.  When prosecutors do appear, which only occurs in scenes where a detective is the primary focus anyway, they are chosen seemingly at random from an unrealistically ethnically diverse group of bad actors.  Basically, nothing that made ""Law and Order"" great has been retained by the SVU; this is nothing more than a make-work project for ""Oz"" and ""Homicide"" actors worried about the imminent cancellations of their day jobs.  Don't waste your time; this is just another mediocre show."
63,"Sad, because i've watched every episode of this show since it began, and has always been my favorite show. it's sad that this show has turned into a vehicle to spout of liberal agenda nonsense...
wish shows would remember that half the population are conservatives, evidently they dont care and have clearly chosen a side... the wrong side.
wont be watching anymore."
64,"We lovingly refer to Law & Order: SVU as Single Villain Unit. Regardless of the ""setting"" the show follows the dame path. The ""guilty party"" will end up ALWAYS being a white hetero male, an evil corporation run by white hetero males or a corrupt government official that is......a white hetero male. In the unicorn rare episode when the ""criminal"" is not an aforementioned white hetero male, there is a mountain of mitigating circumstances due to.... a white hetero male.The show would make a great drinking game if it wasn't so predictable. The best ""cleverness"" are the blatant red herrings: a ""person of color"", woman or anyone that isn't....... a white hetero male. eventually the red herring is cleared but not after a predictable tribulation of racism/bigotry/misogyny from... white people.Interesting how in a city the size of NYC the portrayals of the ""criminals"" is so far removed from reality (and FBI crime statistics) that the show is more akin to fantasy than a crime drama.Also, for the record I am not a white hetero male (Native America/Hispanic), so my review is based on unbiased observation of a show that is predictable and boring."
65,"Dick Wolf expounds his liberal cross eyed superiority with this on sided ""law"" show, has no more to do with the police or courts than a Daffy Duck cartoon. My disabled sister watches this inane propaganda on the 24 hour back to back rerun TV, where the merely stupid and gatling gun dialogue becomes unendingly excruciating. I never thought a show could get so repulsive that I would look forward to the commercials."
66,"I've seen all 19 seasons of this police show and am disappointed that season 19 places so much emphasis on Mariska Hargitay""s character, Olivia Benson.I also have purchased all 19 seasons on DVD and found in Season 19 that a couple of episodes on the second disc are out of order, which makes it hard to follow. Obviously during the editing little interest was taken in putting the content in the correct order. After Brooke Shields' character ""loses"" Noah while shopping the next episode has him as if nothing transpired. Its only in the following episode Noah's kidnapping evolves with all hell breaking lose to find him!All in all quite disappointing. I hope that if there's another season the show focuses on victims of crime rather than Olivia Benson and her son Noah!"
67,"I watched this show from the beginning, enjoyed most episodes, and even enjoyed SVU marathons on rainy weekends. Sadly, this season I decided to turn the show off for good. This show has always been a liberal love fest, but in the last few seasons it's become unbearable. Christians are often referred to as crazy religious fanatics who belong in mental hospitals. Every time there's a crime against a gay character, a Muslim, or an illegal immigrant, one of the cops yells, ""this is America"", ""there's so much hate"", ""it's 2017!"" In case the directors haven't noticed, the world is not a safer place to live, it's getting worse! Things don't get better just because it's a new year, and since when do cops not report people breaking our laws? I didn't realize cops get to choose the laws they want to obey. We know NY is a sanctuary city, we don't need it rubbed in our face! Keep up your hard core liberal agenda SVU! Continue to alienate more of your audience with your continuous liberal agenda and hate for people who love this country, and are tired of seeing our laws broken, and referred to by dried up politicians as deplorables! Let's just continue to rag on conservatives values and blame Trump and all the other crazies in D.C.! This show has really jumped the shark and should've been cancelled along time ago! Olivia Benson needs to stop making promises to people, she knows she's not about to keep most of them, Sadly, this show has been renewed for another season. And in case no one heard, Obama was known as the ""deporter in chief, for good reason!"" Guess SVU forgot about that one! Maybe Olivia will take her boyfriend's advice and retire. She can take her hateful liberal mouth with her!"
68,"This show used to be OK, but over the last couple of years it has lost the plot. It demonizes all men. It portrays men as abusers, and women as victims. This is not the real world. Instead of a balance in drama that reflects our world, it's nothing more than ratings hype. My family are about to stop watching this show.The departure of Elliot Stabler was a blessing. This man played a man hater. He was violent and should have been removed from the police force a long time ago. The new guy seems, so far, to have a more balanced approach to police work. Hope he stays that way!It's disappointing that Dick Wolf and his associates have pushed the show down this draconian path. We have enough problems in society with men being discriminated against, the last thing we need is this sort of irresponsible TV reinforcing the false paradigms of our brainwashed society.From an entertainment perspective, it just isn't. There are many more TV shows out there that have a better entertainment content. I gave this show a 2 because the new guy adds more character to the show than Stabler did."
69,"At times Law and Order keeps you on the edge of your seat with its fast paced action. However it's painfully unrealistic, and most of the stories are hamhanded and ridiculously unbelievable. Half the things and procedures shown would never happen in a special unit, let alone normal police. They try way too hard in most episodes to ""shock"" the viewers and it just comes off as goofy."
70,"I've watched every episode of Law & Order SVU. I enjoyed the ""escape"" from life and was entertained by the creative and thoughtful storylines. The actors are incredibly talented as well.However, the first episode in 2020 was an absolute train-wreck. My wife and I couldn't even finish it. There has been an incredible amount of tension in our country this year, and it is very sad that the director thought we needed more of the ""current events"" in this show, especially all at once.Like many, I really looked forward to this season. I was excited for a favorite show of mine to come back and restore a tad bit of normality to life. These hopes were dashed within the first 5 minutes of the episode.I do not plan to watch any more episodes this season if this is how it's going to go. Please, just give us the show we love, the show that has had huge success over many years. I hope to see a future article that says the team realized they went in the wrong direction with this one and they will give us back the show we enjoy. If not, you can count on me not watching anymore."
71,"I knew it was a bad sign when Christoper Meloni walked away, but man...this show has become absolute crap. The past few seasons are literally unwatchable. Ever since the #MeToo movement started, the writers gave up on writing anything original like when the show first started (and featured guest stars like Robin Williams, Carol Burnett, Judith Light, Martin Short and countless others)...instead, now EVERY episode falls into the ""men are bad, women are victims"" motif that is way too safe and ""woke"" and unfortunately totally bereft of anything that comes close to entertaining (compared to the early days which were all over the place). So sad to see such a great show become such dreck (and the cast obviously having no problem with it, as long as the show gets renewed and they keep getting a paycheck). What a shame. When I saw the preview for the 2020 season debut and the theme was a ""Karen""-inspired episode, I thought my God...they've just completely given up."
72,"At first I was hesitant to start watching this show. I am a survivor of rape and sexual assault, so I was afraid that this would be triggering for me. However it has actually been the opposite. Watching SVU has helped me heal and find closure with my past. I love that they are always actively combatting rape culture, and reminding that every one is worth a damn."
73,"When a show loses the main chemistry, it's not easy to go back to how it was. The right thing to do is try, and if the new plan doesn't work, give up. Unfortunately, SVU still tries things that were already done a long time ago, done better.The main problem with the show started when they lost their main character, the partner of Det. Olivia Benson. They tried several times to recreate that chemistry, but they failed. So, the new strategy was to focus on Olivia.Now the show is completely different from what it was ten years ago. Back then, it was a show about police cases with a little bit of background stories for the detectives. Today, the show puts the cases in second plan and focus too much on the detectives. I'm tired of watching Olivia, or those other characters with weak stories. I'm also tired of the cases that are so predictable. All of the Law & Orders had a very basic plot: a crime happens, the detectives go see the crime scene, the investigation starts with a very good suspect, some other suspects are shown and they find the guy, but then, in a plot-twist they find out that the one who did it was the first suspect all along. Now, when you do that for almost 20 years, even a kid can find out how the story ends. And there's only a limited number of ways to rape and hurt women and children.If anybody wants to watch this, go to the first seasons, they're amazing. Since 2012, the show turned into a circus, it's everywhere and too much is happening for us to actually care."
74,"I watched every episode of law and order, the makers of this show gives too much credit too mariska hargitay when meloni was in the show she pulled herself up but now al the show centeres around this bad actress the rest is pulling down also pls cut down her screen time she is really bad making the show bad, munch has been kicked off the show i liked that man with his conspiracy theori ice t ain't getting a real part the new ones they just don't kick it This show has so many potential but not with mariska the good interaction has gone away and i do not like to watch to the old and fully botoxed face with no expression on it get some new fresh good actors and write again don't write just read the news like u used to do but do something"
75,"I've seen every episode of the original Law & Order, Law & Order LA, a lot of Law & Order CI and every episode of Law & Order SVU up through the end of Season 15 and just a few episodes from Season 16, and really loved most of it.During Season 15 it started to be a pain to watch. It seemed that even the actors knew that the show now stank and were there just cause it's a well paying job and they didn't have other prospects. They didn't even bother to try to act anymore and most of the time just phoned it in. The actors who had integrity left the show.The more the writers started to center stories around the main characters' problems, and especially events surrounding Mariska Hargitay's character Olivia Benson the more unwatchable the series became. I was really hoping that when Olivia Benson was promoted to head of the squad, replacing Captain Donald Cragen, that she would fade out and only get the screen time that Captain Donald Cragen used to get, but sad to say, not so :( The producers seem to think that because Mariska Hargitay had won a few Emmys, that she was the way to go in order to save the show. Emmy's are won for the acting in a single episode and not the whole season.It's really time to pull the plug on SVU; they should've canceled SVU instead of the original Law & Order. The original Law & Order still had life to it and wasn't the stale manure that SVU has devolved to.Season 1 through 13 would get 7 stars, while the last few seasons barely deserve 3 stars."
76,"If I were ever in the situation that stabler and benson puts their innocent suspects in, I would sue the SVU unit for harassment and defamation. Too often are stabler and benson, along with the rest of the SVU crew, unnecessarily aggressive towards suspects. They treat the suspects as already convicted criminals, and too often jump to the wrong conclusions about innocent suspects without all the facts in.Compare this with the original and CI. Both green and briscoe and goren and eames are much more unassuming about their suspects. That isn't to say they don't get hunches and play on them, it's just that they are much more discrete about it--like they don't make wild accusations of ""rapist"" and ""murderer"" before all the facts are in, as stabler and benson do pretty much every episode.Maybe it's just that it seems as if stabler and benson take the crimes to personally, which I find unbelievable for two detectives working exclusively on sexually based offenses. Actually, to begin with, I find it unbelievable that a rape victim would be allowed by any law enforcement agency to work exclusively on rape cases, due to the inherent emotional involvement benson already would have. Anyways, in these types of situations, like doctors who work in the ER or OR, people tend to emotionally distance or detach themselves from their work. Especially in police work--if detectives become fixated on one suspect, they leave all other options closed due to their obsession. I have too much faith in American law enforcement that I would ever believe that a police department would tolerate such aggressive and emotionally charged tactics, and, like I mentioned earlier, tolerate the swarm of lawsuits those two cops must bring on from suspects they had no civility towards and immediately assumed guilt upon at a whim.Moreover, the evident emotional involvement of stabler and benson would suggest that neither of them hold very substantial lives outside work because how could they separate their emotional involvement in work from their family lives?If you are a regular viewer of SVU, I challenge you to keep a running count of how many suspects in SVU are blatantly accused of rape or murder, who, later in the episode, turn out to be innocent when stabler and benson get around to finding out some facts. I did, and counted five in one episode."
77,"I used to love this show, and still enjoy most of the earlier episodes. I've become tired of the political themes though. I watch to see a crime show, not have agendas shoved down my throat. I'm not even conservative and I find it annoying. After seeing the previews for next week's episode, I probably won't watch it. If all the episodes this season are like this, I'll likely just stop watching altogether."
78,I love the show Law & Order SVU- have watched it for years and years. Why have you begun to use the LORD's Name in vain - I am so sad about this - it is not necessary at all and never has been. Please go back to your former dialogue. Thank you. Dick Wolf has created this show and he never used the LORD's Name in vain throughout all the years.
79,"While this show had been good to me for many years, and would make a good show to marathon on Netflix, this show is simply trash police propaganda, as with all other shows such as this. I will never watch this show, or any show like this, again. While at one time it was good to me and good for me, it's plainly propaganda for the police and other hands of government that I want no part of. That negates anything else this show has to offer. This belongs in the trash and in the past, as do the rest of the shows like this. The acts shown and discussed in this show, the way they are presented for the maximum shock value, is disgusting. These acts don;t belong on television. They belong more in the realm of porn, or better yet, nowhere anywhere. Just reading, on sites such as TV Tropes, or thinking or remembering about what happens in this show, is horrific. Nothing in this show should be on any television."
80,"That this show has lasted as long as it has (15 seasons?!) is not merely shocking, but also just plain sad. It is proof positive that one can never underestimate the lack of taste and sophistication in the American TV audience.The entire Law & Order Franchise is pretty dreadful, given it's reliance upon tiresome, essentially unimaginative characters. More than any other -- even Criminal Intent -- L&O SVU relies upon the tiresome, stereotypical jaded, abusive, contemptuous, physically and verbally abusive cop to ""solve"" cases, in main and guest characters.In one episode, Detective Benson willfully ignores a court judgment and assists a woman in leaving the U.S. for a country with no extradition treaty in order to evade court-ordered visitation rights for the father of the woman's child whom she had accused of rape (unsubstantiated by another court). Her supervisor and partners agree to collude and cover up her action. In another, Detective Stabler holds a suspect merely because of a minor prior involvement in another similar case and, when the suspect is quickly cleared of any involvement by DNA, still leaves him in the holding cell. Far too many episodes deal with problems and issues in the detectives personal lives, past and present, in a vain attempt to ""humanize"" them and garner audience empathy.Neither of these detectives is ever apologetic about their abusive behavior when interrogating potential witnesses or suspects, usually without benefit and presence of a defense attorney or public defender. Witnesses and suspects are often threatened with obstructing justice in order to coerce their corroboration of the SVU detectives' assumptions. Their rude and often crude behavior toward members of the public is often reflected back upon them but they never seem to learn that one can get more with honey than vinegar.Inexplicably, this show appears to have achieved wide distribution beyond the U.S. One can only hope that foreign audiences see and try to enjoy it for the fiction that it truly is."
81,"This show used to be very good till season 12 but I feel they have dragged it too much. Watch till season 12 than give this show a skip.
Producers are running this show just based on their old reputation."
82,"This series frightens me, really - not in a good way, though. I just catch myself wondering what's the real intent of this series. See here - series like these seem quite popular these days, and though I'm not at all a fan, I catch stuff like the original Law & Order and NYPD Blue sometimes. And since I'm not a fan, I can't really tell the differences between all those series. But Special Victims Unit jumps at me: it's the kind of show that, once you watched one minute of it, you HAVE to watch till the end. It seems DESIGNED to do so: hook you, capture your mind and get you addicted. It's quite frightening.And it IS a good series - the stories are almost always good, and they're fleshed out in very interesting, entertaining ways. But I just wonder: why is the show so smart and high-brow, filled with post-modernistic tricks like abrupt ""open"" endings and plot twists every minute, when the characters act like the show was made for Homer Simpson? Any given character, ANY of them, will SCREAM their function in the story with just 10 seconds of airtime. I detect no intricacies, no complexities in any of the characters - they're all blatant and one-sided. You don't really need to be that smart to figure out who's the ""smart do-goody-good detective"" and who's the ""annoying EVIL lawyer that's defending the suspect that's obviously guilty"", the ""corrupt EVIL judge who does all sorts of bad stuff for no reason"", the ""MYSTERIOUS suspect that's probably a criminal but might be a victim but is probably lying"". And then, the show was probably made to be like that, too: it was designed not to make you think, reflect and wonder. The problem is proposed and the solution is given within seconds, since everything is so fast-paced and immediate. And there's a satisfying outcome for everything (with rare exceptions, I believe). Good always prevails in the end. They expect me to believe that? Hmm... No matter what shows like these tell me, I just CAN'T believe that the police is so agile, smart and honest like those guys from the series. Either I'm a really, REALLY pessimistic person, or that kind of brainwashing doesn't work on me. It sure does work on some other people, though. That's why shows like these thrive, ain't it?But then, the show IS entertaining. You just have to take it with a bag of salt."
83,"This used to be my favorite series on TV. I love Mariska Hargitay; but I don't necessarily agree with all of her personal political views. That wouldn't and shouldn't matter; a great show is a great show. Why it matters is because the series has become too much of a sounding board for a liberal political view. Not just occasionally, it seems like all the time now. Too much, unchecked, unbalanced, mo Captain Cragen or Elliott with a more conservative view. It used to be, Liv would sometimes be proven to be wrong in her crusades. That doesn't seem to happen anymore; the series is worse off for it."
84,"So much for the caring, understanding treatment of the vulnerable victims. that SVU made it's name upon. S13 e8 had Fin threaten a completely innocent witness with being raped in jail if he refused co-operate Then in the very next episode we see Amago intimidate a mentally ill patient by exploiting his fears of having someone out of sight behind him.Very well done there to the SVU production crew, you obviously understand how easy it is to gain power over vulnerable people. . . I have to write more lines but it's just filler as I think I have dais more than enough."
85,"The best part about SVU is that each episode has it's own unique style and can range from political to religious, personal to international and by no means at all do you have to wait until the season finale for an amazing episode. Episodes range from their worst as good television to their best as absolutely phenomenal. The dramatic writing is great (the comedic usually consists of not-so-subtle puns and one-liners, but that's to be expected), and the acting is prime: Olivia and Elliot are a powerhouse duo and Hargitay and Meloni play them with passion and purpose. I'm surprised they haven't won more awards than they already have. Supporting characters and guest actors are consistently great too.Even though its in its 11th season, the stories are still new and exciting and must be watched!"
86,"I am not usually into law all that much but this show is an exception. Each actor does an excellent job portraying their character and the show keeps me on the edge of my seat in every episode I watch.Also, they do a excellent job at making the least suspected character that many don't think did the crime, the one who actually did do the crime.They also do a good job at making the storyline for each episode. Instead of keeping the same old ones in every episode, they mix the story lines between rape, poison, kidnap, beating, child abuse etc. You just never know what the show is about until you watch it and that is what makes it so great. Overall, I give this excellent show a 10/10."
87,"I don't like this show because it is only propaganda to get people to hate sex offenders. All the statistics show, including the one from the Justice department, states 95% do NOT repeat another sex crime. I like shows that do not have an agenda. This show only shows the worst cases and that is a very small percentage of what actually happens. This spreads hate and hysteria. And the facts show that sex offenders have less job deficits and less education deficits. Most get out of prison and rebuild a good life."
88,"I used to LOVE this show. Like many, I was sad when Stabler left and kept hoping he'd return but, hey, at least we still had Munch, Cragen and Fin. The show should've ended when Munch and Cragen left. Since then, it seems the sole purpose of this show is to surpass the record set by the FAR SUPERIOR original ""Law & Order"" which NEVER should've ended (or, at least been given the proper send-off it deserved). The last several years of SVU have been completely unwatchable. Not because of the so-called ""leftist propoganda"" some viewers have accused but because the writing, acting, and overall feel and tone of the show has descended to the immeasurably low quality formerly found only in embarrassingly inferior ""Law & Order"" wannabe franchises (CSI, NCIS, Criminal Minds, et al).This show doesn't deserve to have the record for longevity when the quality has been sorely lacking for at least the last 1/3 of its run. Just END it already!"
89,"Det. Olivia Benson is just awful. No matter what a possible victim says the character is believed by Benson. The last episode is just some rant, speech filled crap. Benson's big, big speeches are so bad and boring. Hartiguys shot her wad and this show is toast. Last episode is the all-time worst episode. Benson should retire, she is a horrible actress ."
90,"This used to be such a great show. But like all things these days, Political Correctness and Liberalism has seeped in this show in many forms. Specifically, Any White Male character on the show is always the perp that is guilty in the end, mixed with the women or the minorities are nearly every time a victim of suppression, sexism or racism no matter the circumstances."
91,"This episode was terrible. Who on earth wrote this? I can't believe how AWFUL this was, and I love the show."
92,"As always Benson is right, what is the point in watching, in the old days you had to work it out, now what ever Benson says is right. I will not watch this anymore as it has lost any all interest for me. Benson is to much the main character let see more of the other actors in the show. Lets see some episodes where Benson is human and not always right. Until then forget it I'll watch the news."
93,Really enjoyed it until it became leftist propaganda.
94,"When Law & Order: Special Victim's Unit first started, I loved it. I thought it was well written and engaging with interesting story-lines. Alas, this isn't the case any more. This show has really jumped the shark recently. Well at least it still looks stylish and innovative, and the music is still clever and memorable.However, the story lines are now predictable together with very slack pacing, and the writing is now lazy and clichéd. The direction isn't as secure as before either, and the acting the excellent Mariska Hargitay excepted is laborious with next to no chemistry, no surprise really seeing as the characters have become dull. Overall, started off amazing, now I can't watch it without cringing. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
95,"Yeah, this show has been ruined by the political poison propaganda of left extremists.
That new Kat character with the giant distracting ears has got to go. Her character is stupid and every time she talks it's like I'd rather hear teeth scraping cement. I'm hoping for a storyline in which she is shot and killed or kills herself. That would be a 10 star episode."
96,"It's not PC I know to mention that sometimes charges are FALSE. Is there ONE episode of SVU whereas the accuser is lying? I like this show, and certainly enjoy seeing violent perps go down for their crimes. Where's the OTHER side of the story though?"
97,"The way these characters are written , the gooder than good cops/pigs who have every right to push anyone they choose around is right out of the south before people were freed . The male cop is batman in disguise who is such a great daddy and hubby always striving to save the world and female is constantly reaching for balls she just doesn't have ,The rapper and the comedy guy are terrible as well , but its the writing that they are forced to work with . Its of low quality and not believable , I don't think any actor could sell it , its so very cliché' , nothing inovative or even close to reality . The reason why people with money get away with crimes is because they have the money to hire people to find the police ineptitude that is always present .That is never seen here except in the writing of the horrible scripts ."
98,"This used to be one of the best crime shows on TV and the best in the Law and Order franchise and then Mariska Hargitay took over.
She's now the executive producer, and she has ruined the show.
Apart from Ice-T, who has little to do nd is sadly underused, the great characters have all gone, especially Christopher Meloni as Elliot Stabler.
The stories are weak and seem to follow a political agenda. Unless Hargitay steps back and stops pushing herself into every story this has lost me as a viewer."
99,"Some people prefer the original. Some people (a limited group, I must say) prefer CI (though it gets the worst reviews of the three). Some people just seem to hate Mariska, for whatever reason.But I love this show more than anything, and Mariska, I think, is probably the high point of the show. After all, what would the show be without Olivia Benson?The cases suck you in through their sheer momentum - rape, child abuse - things most people find sickening, which is why it's so amazing that this show even exists. And the plots are excellent at that.And then you have the characters. L & O is famous for not giving you much depth into their characters - SVU is easily the one with the most character development. You've got John Munch, who's gone through numerous wives, is in love with the ideal of love even though he's never found it, used to work Baltimore homicide, and is a complete smart ass in love with conspiracies. Elliot Stabler is a former marine with 4 kids and a 20-year marriage to his high school sweetheart. Fin - well, Fin's the most private of the four main detectives, which works for him.And then you have Olivia. The only female member of the squad, her history is part of what drew me to the show. Her mother was raped by her father, and Serena Benson had Olivia through that horrible crime. A drunk, she wasn't the best of mothers, but you can tell that Liv still loved her. But it's a past that still haunts her.All of the actors and actresses do a fantastic job at conveying the emotions of these people. I'm still bemoaning the loss of Stephanie March as Alex Cabot, and really hope that I'll stop hating Casey (Diane Neal) Novak for replacing her sometime soon.But lord knows, I will keep watching this show for as long as I can."
100,I've only been watching the repeats for the last year or so but absolutely LOVE IT!!!
101,"Okay i started watching this show not when it premiered because that was 9 years ago and i was 10 back then, and not allowed to watch shows like that back then lol. But as soon as i started to watch this show i knew it was the show for me, this show honestly has EVERYTHING. acting top notch, directing, producing, story line, suspension, everyhting that a show should have :). In addition to all those factors this show is completely educating. I am a psychology major and half of the material we learn i learn watching this show. Every time i answer all questions in my class without reading the material. I think that children these days are much more mature than they used to be and if they watch this show starting at age 13-14 instead of watching other shows that they should not be, they would be much more educated in this world of ours. Aagin this show is an amazing show, these writers sure know what they are doing. Other shows should take a great big example from this show:) Thank you"
102,"Let the writers and the actors have the time to grow into their material. If you don't remember, the first couple of seasons of Law and Order had their share of clunkiness.It's a pity Dean Winters won't be a regular anymore, but his character on Oz is far more central to the action than Chris Meloni's--the strain of the double duty he was pulling was starting to show on camera.  The rest of the cast is more than able to pick up the slack here.Benson and Stabler are rapidly becoming one of my favorite teams in L&O history.  The only way the writers could spoil this would be to make them a romantic couple.  Contrary to popular belief, it IS possible for heterosexual men and women to work closely together without a sexual relationship developing, particularly if one of them takes marriage and family as seriously as Stabler does.  Just because McCoy and Kincaid became an item doesn't mean every M-F team need to do so.Munch and Jefferies are a bit more problematic.  The tension between them doesn't work all that well dramatically, and it makes you wonder why Cragen would pair them together to begin with.  Also, Munch's intellectual arrogance is starting to wear a bit thin.In the first few episodes, a prosecutor was a recurring character, but she doesn't appear in the character list.  I'd really like to see more of her on the show.  Anyone know the name of the character or the actress?Incidentally, my roommate appeared on an episode of the show back in November--he was one of those cops that gives the expository information in the first five minutes."
103,"I used to love this show in the early years, and found myself watching it for the first time in years tonight - the episode was a good one which was very topical but I found myself distracted by how plastic Mariska Margitay's face looks and the face of the blonde woman. This makes me sad - ageing gracefully is much more realistic (what police detective could afford THAT much plastic surgery) plus generally more attractive. It is like they are wearing masks! C'mon America stop encouraging women to make a mockery of their own natural beauty and look like plastic store mannequins!!!"
104,"I watched it after 5-6 years. It used to be very good stuff. Acting were good. There were a lot of action and different stories. I can't say acting is bad now. But plots are so simple. There is nothing exciting, and almost no action. Ms. Hargitay got obviously older. I watched an episode last night, they just talked to the victim, brought the accused, asked them questions, brought the issue to the court! Where is the plot for God's sake? It seemed like ordinary police investigation. Why we should want to watch it? Either it must be renewed with new stories and plots and action, or it must make a final. Read the reviews from early days, I am sure producers would agree too."
105,"I've gotten sick and tired of the self-righteous posturing by both the characters played by Hargitay and Meloni in L&O SVU, and much prefer the cool distance portrayed by the actors in the other L&O series. You have a talented character actor in D'Onofrio playing a cerebral and subtle character. It's a pleasure to watch him work a suspect. Both of the SVU leads portray such pains in the butt that I find myself avoiding those shows.Hargitay's mannerisms look acted and fake. I realize she can't help her toothiness but she could act more believably. Meloni's simmering rage and savage glares are annoying. Both of them play obnoxious goo-die-goodies. Please find a better actress and calm Meloni's character down so I can get back to enjoying the perfectly good plots instead of being distracted and wearied by the actors."
106,I've watched it from the beginning. It used to be a really strong detective/law show and even though you still get the odd good one still but most of the stories are barely watchable. You'll find that either the episode starts off well but the path the writers decides to go done just stuffs it. Or it just runs bad from start to finish. That is excluding when they go overboard on the personal drama or decide to make a political statement of some kind (which I never like). I still watch it for the odd good episode but it is getting to the point where I don't think I'll be able to watching it anymore. It is getting just too bad.
107,These guys are really reaching for new material. getting really boring. time to wrap this up. ice t needs to learn acting. he is as bad as his band body count.
108,"Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is a huge disappointment.  If the show is trying to get by on the merits of its name, the plots and characters will certainly turn viewers away.  Mariska Hargitay's character is annoying and comes off as one dimensional.  Do smart, capable women, as Det. Benson is presumed to be, always have to be harsh, cold and humorless?  Or is it Ms. Hargitay's acting?  It is becoming increasingly difficult to watch the show with her being one of the airtime leads.  The Belzer-Winters duo should be featured more often, and Chris Meloni (Det. Stabler) needs a different partner.The writing lacks substance.  Why does it always seem that the writers have stretched a potentially powerful half-hour program into a weak full-hour one?  Character development has remained in the superficial realm, with Det. Munch the only one allowed to emote.  Almost every other character has been handled in cookie-cutter fashion.Overall, this program has been intellectually vacuous, emotionally disappointing, and devoid of the entertainment value anticipated.  More should be expected from a show that has its origins in one of the best programs on Network TV, the original Law & Order."
109,"I used to love this show, but now it's all about Benson. She leads the charge, delivers all the crushing lines, saves the day, swans around as is SVU was her baby, and we get her flamin personal life thrown in to boot.I am irritated now by her. Her twee soft voice when trying to appear caring, her cocking her head to the left when trying to appear sympathetic.Mariska can't act. She has for some reason risen up through the ranks of this once brilliant show and now in her leading lady role, as well as producer and director has turned it into a one trick, three legged donkey."
110,"While I think Mariska Hargitay is a good actress she has stayed far to long in this role. She has now worked her way up to Captain, in the Special Victims Unit. A job that those in the unit say no one should stay more then 7 years. However Captain Olivia Benson, but still acts like she is just a detective and out in the street with the other detectives. With all her interaction with the victims in each episode, the show should be renamed Captain Olivia Saves NYC.
This show is renewed through 2022 by which time she should have worked her way up to Police Commissioner of NYC and head of 1 P P. While this show was great it has been on far too long and become stale and predictable. There are only so many ways to same story for certain sex crimes and this show has done them all in the 21 seasons it has been on now many times over. If something better was come on at the same time I could easily drop this show and not miss it. As it is now come to the point of seen that before more then once and have the Tee Shirt to prove it."
111,"It is still good, some episodes are too slow and shallow but some are great. It is worth keep watching, for the great ones."
112,I like the bit where it goes doot doot in between sections of the show
113,"The first 8 or 9 seasons of this program were great. But around season 9 or 10 there was a change in the stories (new writers maybe ? ) Whatever the reason they stopped solving crimes with good police work. Instead they now just pick a suspect and start accusing and screaming until they (the suspect) can prove their innocence. Then the detectives move on to the next person who might have some connection to the victim. This is repeated until they just sort of stumble across the real perp. Of course this often results in some innocent person having their lives ruined.( Don't worry though, Olivia and Elliot will look sad for a minute or two.) Granted, not all of the episodes are written this way...just most of them. All in all,watch seasons 1 through 8 or 9. they were great."
114,"I can't believe this show ever made it to airing. It's full of misrepresentations and is a big reason why people tend not to trust law enforcement. ""Det Benson"" is the worst, with her lying and browbeating witnesses, intimidating people with untruths, not to mention lying to suspects, her illegal searches without warrants, and her lying, lying, lying. What a ridiculous show!"
115,"Let me begin by saying this is an excellent show. On of the few to hit the ground running and pump out 8 solid seasons but season 9 just isn't up to the old standard. I'm not sure if it's the transition to digital, if they have a new DofP, if it's bad direction or just the show's age starting to come through but there's something that's just not feeling the same about my favorite police-procedural. Visually (In particular the episodes Savant and Signature) are very static and overly clean. Scenes come across as being filmed on a set rather than being a looking glass into a real lived in, gritty world. At the very least the post-production process needs to be changed to dirty it up or tone it down. Story lines seem to be slipping too. The previously mentioned Signature is downright terrible. There's a tendency towards CSI type exposition that has (mostly) been kept to a minimum. Senseless technobabble slips through more this season than any other (DNA on shell casings?) and the character bits that made this show great seem to be going the way of the dinosaur. Now I'm sure people will argue that last one and I will say the mannerisms that I love are still there. Stabler is still a tightly wound ball of rage, Benson is still the empathetic idealist, chained to the job by her own circumstance. But the moments that make the characters who they are seem blown out, made BIGGER as though just having their mannerisms balls out there is enough to justify not writing them well.All in all I love this show and I hope they start to fix what they've been doing wrong because I would hate to see SVU turn into something unremarkable.I also dislike the bank of monitors replacing the transparent whiteboard. Of course I didn't like it when the whiteboard became transparent either."
116,"Here's one example:
Kid is kidnapped and dies.
A psicotic, communist, mother wants to kidnap the child, which she doesn't have guard, and take him to China. Hires a guy to do it. Guy declines after realizing she doesn't have the guard, she goes after another guy.
Turns out the rich and successful father, who wants to put the kid in a good school and thinks routine and tranquility are good for kids, and WHICH DOES HAVE THE GUARD OF THE SON, is the one who hired the kidnapper.
WTF??? Where does that make any sense? Why, would a father WHO HAS THE GUARD OF THE CHILD, kidnap his own son?
But, the successful rich people are always the guilty ones, right?"
117,"I don't need to explain anything other than the entire production sucks. There are gobs upon gobs of continuity errors and deus ex machina through out every single episode. It baffles me that criminals don't know already that if you go to ""talk"" to the investigators that you don't just say ""I plead the 5th. Where is my phone call so I can speak to my lawyer"". And when a lawyer does show up they are incompetent."
118,"I look forward to seeing the new and the old shows of the Special Victims Unit. I truly enjoy them. I do not like Criminal Intent because the main detective seems to know everything and leaves nothing to the imagination. Special Victims Unit is good from beginning to end with everyone participating. There is no ""Mr. Know-it-all"" like there is in Criminal Intent. The cases in the Special Victims Unit seems so real and I love the fact that they officers are always searching and digging. They appear to be tough and sometimes intense, yet they show their human side. They care about the victims. I love all of the actors in Special Victims Unit. It's a great series and if I had the time, I would watch it all day long. I rarely miss and episode. I like the original Law and Order, but my favorite is The Special Victims Unit. I do not like Criminal Intent. There is no team work there and one man knows everything!"
119,"I caught this show last night for the first time I haven't had a TV for three years. Judging from the treatment of last nights issue (AIDS) this is a stupid, stupid show. I'm sure this malarkey plays well in Peoria though, where people like to think they're thinking deeply about issues.In the episode the brother of a man who died of AIDS goes on trial for killing two men who were infecting others. His anguish is enacted in a long overwrought series of squints and grimaces.The case held no tension because in this brand of mellow, soft-feely, drama, the ending would have to return you to the benign world where you live, and the consumerist coma you experience life from.In a case that never would have made it trial two lawyers painstakingly lay out obvious arguments for and against the defendant. The big turn? the prosecuting attorney establishes that the brother who had sex without a condom was at fault. Holy Mary! that is shrewd. (!) Quick, what's the biggest ethical issue of the day? Hand it to these writers so they can fart out the answer. Gay people already know the ambiguity of being the infector or the infectee. They've dealt with it for over 20 years. This crap is a moral spoon-feeding of it's middlebrow audience.The U.S. has become a middle-aged country full of moral simpletons, who like to do nothing, but judge everyone. This show is a tribute to the things we pretend to think about until being distracted by ice cream and car chases."
120,"When I first started watching this show is was a immediate fan my thoughs where great a show that concentrates on the victims and not just C.S.I like stuff the episode where always different and all do they have to keep it as realistic as possible they also had enough plot twist and deeper storylines going on than just ok she is sexual assaulted he is the one who did it lets cuff him judge him and that's it ..
But by now the story lines are getting way to predictable and to simple ...also all the political underlining hints are getting way to obvious every episode ..the amount of episodes spend on HATE crimes and stuff is just unreal.I get it man are bad woman are good woman are always the victim and man always the predator or killer !if it only was that simple ...I would like to see some episodes spend on man getting falls accusations against them or a episode of two about a female predator or female sex offender because there are tons of victims of female sex offenders just think about the amount of woman PIMPS
So to some it all up : Great show but its getting kind of boring one sided and it misses depth it seems like they figured out ok this works lets just keep on going with this and keep on telling the same old storys"
121,"I've always thought that Special Victims Unit was qualitatively inferior to the original Law And Order. Not that the cast was bad and certain individual episodes were outstanding. But overall the concept of focusing on sex crimes led our detectives way far field into areas that certainly were not in their jurisdiction. In real life Benson, Staebler, Tutuola, and Munch should have handed off cases to other squads and investigative units and even other police agencies.Still Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay made a most professional team and their biggest contribution to the show's staying power was demonstrating that two people could have a most professional relationship without becoming romantically involved. When Meloni started having marital issues they were not over Mariska.It took awhile, but Richard Belzer who retired from the Baltimore PD and went right to work for the Sex Crime Unit at the NYPD finally came up with a chemically compatible partner in Ice-T. In fact all four of the detectives register with unique personalities and a take on life.The producers of Law And Order owed Dann Florek big time for dropping him from the prime series so it was nice to see him back in charge of this squad. A nice connection to the original series.This show's gets far more way out in its stories, but they are delivered with pride and professionalism as befits the cast. Only the most especially heinous of crimes are dealt with here."
122,"A spin-off of the 'Law and Order' series, 'Law & Order: Special Victims Unit' has to be one of the best police shows on television in a long time. While I do enjoy the original 'Law and Order' series, it has to take a distant second place to SVU with it's gritty, involving scripts, well-depicted characters and excellent performances from all the cast. It is never afraid to portray the darker side of humanity and what depths people can go to in hurting another.The characters give the audiences different means of venting their disgust and shock of the abuse cases the SVU team deal with. From Christopher Meloni's Elliot Stabler, who openly displays the utter hatred of paedophiles that we all identify with (and I hope there are many officers like Stabler in the police forces across the world), to Mariska Hargitay's Olivia Benson, who shows deep caring for the child and abuse victims she comes into contact with. The rest of the cast are also brilliant and give you a feel that these are characters who care for each other and the people they protect.With the amount of rubbish that is aired on British television at the moment, SVU reminds me why I bother to keeping buying a TV license."
123,"Network: NBC; Genre: Crime, Drama; Content Rating: TV-14 (for language, adult content, blood, violence and implied deviant sexual content); Available: DVD and syndication on USA; Perspective: Contemporary (star range: 1  4); Seasons Reviewed: Series It is any time of the day or night and you can turn on the TV and see ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"".The first spin-off from Dick Wolf's popular ""Law & Order"" series, ""SVU"" focuses on the New York detectives solving the city's most heinous sex crimes. This time a new team made of Detectives Stabler (Christopher Meloni) and Benson (Mariska Hargitay), Captain Cragen (Dann Florek, reprising his role from the original) as well as an ensemble including Ice-T and Richard Belzer are the ones using the magic of the ""Law & Order"" title card and trademark chime to hop around Manhattan interviewing witnesses.While several of the episodes do wind up in a courtroom, ""SVU"" frees the franchise of the strict street/trial format of the original series, allowing creator Dick Wolf a little more freedom with the stories. The problem with that is that Wolf is kind of a hack. With a hit series, a loyal audience and a network that not only thinks the guy can do no wrong, but that every other show should follow his lead, Wolf makes ""SVU"" something of a crime series chameleon. Wolf shapes and re-shapes it each week to be any crime show he wants. If he wants it to be ""Homicide"", if he wants it to be ""The Shield"", if he wants it to be (the nerve) ""Boomtown"", if he wants it to be the original ""Law & Order"" or it's follow-up ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"", then that's what it will be that week. ""SVU"" has no personality of its own.Episodes can be standard ""Law & Order"" fair, they can be hostage crisis, they could follow the tracking a stalking serial killer, or they might be a study of the inner anguish of one of our leads. Halfway through Wolf decides Stabler will be a raging ""SVU"" answer to Vic Mackey. Guest stars trot in and make star turns (like a daringly out-of-character Martin Short) and we try to pretend they aren't the killer until the show is ready to reveal it to us.One of my biggest issues with the show, the entire franchise actually, is this. The show takes up so much time talking to witnesses, slowly mounting the case and giving us red herrings, that when the time comes for that trademark ""Law & Order"" twist that NBC loves so much it requires the show to cheat  and hold back a ton of information in order to make the twist a surprise. So at the climactic moment, right when the show should be nailing us between the eyes, that week's killer is left to chew through a lengthy monologue explaining their actions and cover any possible plot-holes for the armchair mystery solvers in the audience.It is now state the obvious time. All the ""Law"" shows have a political bent to them. ""SVU"" is the most, let's say, ideologically dedicated. Every character, particularly Belzer's, is a bitter liberal, a mouthpiece for Wolf who vents his political frustration into a teleplay instead of on a therapist's couch. It there was a finesse to this, we would be calling it a triumph of liberal self-expression, but Wolf clumsily, tactlessly and insultingly shoe-horns his jabs in the middle of completely unrelated dialog. The result an exchange goes something like this: ""The killer must have raped her, escaped through a sewer pipe and hoped in the back of a van smuggling human cargo back to Mexico""; to which Belzer responds, ""This is just like the Bush administration stealing our social security"". It's embarrassing.Then, other times the show goes into full-on David E. Kelley mode and the entire episode is shaped into a manipulative, sanctimonious cautionary tale about the necessity of abortion, illegal immigration, euthanasia, government dissent  the usual stuff. There is very little new here.Despite the sex-based material, this show doesn't have the dramatic punch that the other shows do. It fails to really boil the blood and get us engaged. On the surface it might seem like the stories about rape victims, bondage fetishes, secret homosexual poker games, Russian mail-order brides and psychotic prostitutes is Wolf pushing the envelope. But look at the cast and read between the lines. I can't help but think that ""SVU"" is NBC's attempt at a hip, young, edgy ""Law & Order"" for those who might think the original show is about a bunch of old men. You're just going to have to be a ""Law & Order"" fan. I'm not a huge fan of Wolf's client-based, self-contained, easily digestible ""Law & Order"" storytelling style  and ""SVU"" the weakest of the franchise.* ½ / 4"
124,"Let's face it, this is just not that good a show.  The acting is wooden, and the plots are boring.  Especially nauseating is the way the characters personal lives are brought into play.  Who cares who's sleeping with who in the squad room?  One of ""Law & Order's"" virtues was that it avoided that kind of soap opera crap.  If Mariska Hargitay has any talent as an actress, it doesn't come through on this show.  About the only bright spot is the underrated Michelle Hurd.  They don't let her character grow much but at least she's nice to look at.  That's more than I can say for the show in general.  Don't be suprised when this one gets cancelled."
125,"I was surfing through the channels the other night when I noticed that Law and Order: SVU was on. I had never watched this show before so I decided I might as well give it a try since Law and Order seems to be ever growing in popularity. Boy, do I regret that.Not only is the show chock-full of terrible actors but the storyline was awful as well! I will first speak on the actors. Mariska Hargitay, I've noticed, has been nominated for and won several Emmy's. However, she's definitely nothing to shout about! Her wins and nominations are probably just because the media is obsessed with women these days! Christopher Meloni squints his eyes too much when he talks and plays his part with far too much anger and hatred! I know that if I was a victim I definitely wouldn't want him on my case!!! Richard Belzer speaks with such monotony that I was sure I would fall asleep during his parts on the show. Miraculously I didn't! Unfortunately this meant I had to stay awake for Ice-T's parts. He's living proof that a pimp rapper should never go into television! Finally, BD Wong is the only decent part of the show. His character is so subtle and such a great contrast to the hobnob bunch of characters on the police force.The stories, on the other hand, are just as bad. The episode I was unlucky enough to see was about a Neo Nazi group. Of course one of the main supporters of the group had to be a woman with a distinct southern accent. Also, the episode featured the use of racial slurs that I didn't appreciate hearing! Finally, the story was downright stupid. As it turned out, the southern woman was actually an FBI agent. Um, hello??? How silly! Maybe the other Law and Order series are better, I'm not sure. All I know is that SVU will never be seen on my TV screen again!"
126,"The acting in this series is so trite and poor, the most unrealistic police and court occurrences............................................................................................................................................. I can not believe this is even part of the LAW & ORDER Chain.......... ....................................................................................................................................................Law & Order and Law & Order C I are so amazing and well thought out and projected. There seems to be no effort or brain activity occurring with these outrageous and UNREALISTIC episodes. What Happened here?????????????????????? Still In SHOCK this is still airing!!! Out Of Stars ----------- NEGITIVE - 10"
127,"It is rare that a spin-off of a show is better than the original. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit has managed to fit into that category. With its dark themes, great writing, gripping story lines, and fantastic characters, Law & Order: SVU surpassed the original Law & Order in my own opinion. This show is a must watch for TV fans everywhere. I do not believe this show has ever had a bad episode. Every episode hooked me enough that I didn't want to get up from my couch. Many episodes had me on the edge of my seat. It is rare for me to be genuinely excited for a seven-hour TV marathon, but this show makes me want to sit and watch it all day. I'd definitely recommend it to my friends."
128,"This is one of the best shows on television.Elliot and Liv could easily date and not ruin the dynamic. Many strong-willed, physically athletic, quite intelligent brunette women on television suffer from stunted emotional lives and incredible isolation. The woman who suffers from overcommitment to her job and a dearth of dating options or friends apart from her colleagues is becoming the cliché of the forty-something generation.Liv and El could date without ruining the dynamic of the show.Please listen to me. I need some role models on television who can be smart AND sexy, attractive AND badass, happy with their careers of choice AND fulfilled in their personal lives.I do not believe that a woman must choose between her job and her ability to have healthy friendships or a loving partnership. The fact that Olivia has been through h*** far more often on this show than any human being reasonably can be expected to survive has been much remarked upon on the boards. Please take this into account, writers, and give the poor woman some happiness, hmm? Perhaps no one has ever escaped this show ""happy"" per se, but few if any characters have ever faced the depths of despair this one has, with great grace.Oh--and also, the show's becoming a bit of a boys' club and has been that way for too long. I really liked it when two of the investigating detectives working for SVU were female, and I really for the record miss that original female detective who left after only a year. Please consider integrating a female detective rather than counting on a female DA not offered the opportunity to commune with others on the show and thus not able to develop much of a personality to carry the feminine-powr! torch. P.S. The people who think there's too much Olivia on the show are wrong, but if y'all don't start giving her some less depression story lines, even Mariska Hargitay's acting won't keep me interested in what happens to her.I do not want my television screen filled up night after night with women who feel forced to choose between these two goals and wind up sacrificing their personal life to their professional one.Rather than coming off like a grown-up woman who has made peace with her past, Olivia seems like a career apologist to her mother for her existence. Rather than coming off like an independent woman capable of surviving on her own but happy with the knowledge that she does not have to, Olivia seems bitter, angry, resentful, and lonely.I do not want to watch my strong role model become a bitter old maid. I as a viewer and someone who has suffered way too much in my own life deserve better.As incredible as Mariska Hargitay is, I will stop watching this show if the writers do not manage to do better.My thanks for what you have managed to do with this show, which is to shed light on sexual abuse and rape in ways no other show has been willing to do. Your victims are ugly, depressed, upset, and REAL, not the stylized beauty queens featured on CSI who seem made only more glamorous by whatever pain they have endured. Real pain is not beautiful, it is as ugly as the emotional repression of the ugly-hearted men who have caused it. Thank you for being willing to show that. I will be forever grateful to this show for what it has accomplished, and that is much more than anyone else has managed to do.You have helped make this world more of a heaven--and a haven--for people like me; you have done so for everyone, really. I have a dream..."
129,"The first time I decided to see it I was skeptic because I thought it was a TV series too positive, full of good-thinking and too centered on the honor to the law and the State etc. etc. but I had to change my opinion... Now, after watching many many many episodes ^_^, I think it's great! I appreciated it because it shows to the spectator shocking situations, that could be true, but also the profiles of characters, policemen/women and not. So it adds authenticity to the stories and it helps to understand and to know characters in a better way obviously with the help of actors' very good interpretations! In facts I think that all the cast is good (especially Mariska Hargytai and Christopher Meloni). There are some bloody particulars that are a little shocking, as I said, but it is a series that get the spectator to reflect about society and so you should watch it."
130,"The series should set focus on ""the special victims"" but with bad acting that plot line doesn't come out good. I don't see anything that makes me feel so sorry about the victims. However I see actors/actresses who play out their frustration in a very bad way and I only think it's laughable (makes me smile) because now I see the mistakes that the actors/actresses do and not focus on what the title say, ""Special Victims"". This makes me put the spin offs in this order. #1 Criminal Intent #2 Trial bu Jury #3 SVU. B.D. Wong does a great job but you see him all the time which is bad. However I guess that's with his part because he doesn't send out his frustration every time because he can see why a criminal behave like he does."
131,"Ever since, my mom showed me this show, I fell in love with all the characters, especially with Olivia Benson, and Casey Novak. But all the other characters like Munich, Tutola, and Elliot, are all amazing! SVU, reveals not only the victim, and the criminals but also the problems, that the characters have to face, and consider. As well, the problems, with child molestation and Sexual abuse, is faced in this world today.My favorite character Olivia Benson shows so much depth, about reaching out to the victims, and trying to find her owns reason, makes me feel like I want to be her. I also love it how she can touch the victims, with such caring words. If Mariska Haritigay were to leave, I won't watch SVU anymore, without her, it wouldn't be Law and Order: SVU. The same with Casey Novak, she will do anything to help the victims. But after she left...I was soooo upset that she left."
132,"Long running TV drama produced by Dick Wolf, among others , and usual musical score by Mike Post , it tells the stories of two different yet equally important teams , the main : the cops who investigate crimes , carried out by the Special Victims Unit and the public attorney at law who prosecute the offenders . The series presented from the perpective of a professional police force starts with the following sentence: in the criminal justice system sexually based offenses are considered especially heinous. In NYC the dedicated detectives that investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite special oknown as the special victim unit . These are their stories .Nice show delves into the more ominous crimes , investigating the dark side of NYC underworld , particularly prosecuting various sexually oriented conducts such as heinous abuse, violation, molestation , family sex crimes , internet misdemeanours and other grim activities , as well as heinous delinquents , as rapists, attackers , muggers , assailants and panderers . It follows a crime usually adapted from current front pages and headlines from two separate vantage points , the police investigation and the subsequent prosecution court, describing the juicidal system , including judge , jury , solicitor and prosecutor . At the same time the protagonists are attemting to balance the consequences of the investigations on their own existences.The series is well starred by Mariska Hargitay , also producer, she played 435 episodes , Christopher Meloni played 272 episodes and the ordinary secondaries as Ice T in 413 , Richard Belzer 326 , BD Wong in 230 , Tamara Tunie in 222 and finally the chief Dan Florek in 331 episodes . Following seasons appear Kelli Giddish , Raul Esparza , Diane Neal and Danny Pino .Other series about ¨Law and order¨ produced by Dick Wolf , Julie Martin , Warren Leight , Rene Balcer , Ted Kotcheff and many others are the following ones : the first ¨Law and Order¨created by Dick Wolf during 1990-2010 and following ¨Law and order : Criminal intent¨ .

Furthermore , a British version of the long running series produced by Dick Wolf , Rene Balcer , starred by a new elite force headed by Jamie Bamber , Ben Daniels, Freema Agyeman , Bill Paterson , and Harriet Walter ."
133,"No idea how this scored an 8, terrible acting and story lines, typical American dross."
134,"This version of the Law and Order series is interesting because it reduces the justice part to as little as possible, except when there is a real problem in court, such as the decision of a verdict that frees a criminal, a murderer most of the time on some technicality or some doubt about the intention of the criminal.The sexual dimension of these cases is always quite obvious but can be of many different types from voyeurism to stalking and to rape and murder. This dimension of these crimes is interesting because it erases the cases themselves, or nearly. This dimension is so shocking that we do not try to really understand the subtlety of the investigation that is not always very subtle as if the nature of the crime justified some sloppy and violent procedure on the side of the police.But on the side of the main characterization of these crimes, we deal with illegal immigrants, some racial minorities, sexist people, incest, pedophilia, and quite many other colorations and dressings. It is these options that give the series an interest because then they deal with real social problems in New York. And it is open enough to look at sex crimes in a more comprehensive way than just from men against women.It is rather entertaining and easy to watch, even if after a while it appears somewhat redundant. It is also true that the short format of the series does not encourage any analysis in depth of the circumstantial and existential context of the crimes.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"
135,"I have been a loyal viewer of the original Law and Order series, which is one of the best shows on television today. I started watching ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit"" last season because of my affinity for its predecessor.     SVU, in its debut season, started off as an good idea: a spinoff which would handle different types of cases than the original. Many people, myself included, felt it had problems in its execution because, although it was a spinoff, it didn't retain the same format of law AND order. Most of SVU's first season was mostly law and didn't show much of the ""order"" format, aside from guest appearances from ADA Carmichael. I think that decision was made in order for the viewers to focus on the new detectives of this series, through their work and home lives. It was a good idea, but again, problems in its execution. It focused too much on Detective Stabler's family and not enough on the personal lives of the other detectives. I would have enjoyed more background on them, especially on Munch and Benson. Benson's personal history is much more interesting than Stabler's, considering that she was a child born of rape, who never knew her father, and became a sex crimes detective.       Now in its second season, the producer, Dick Wolf, has greatly improved the show through major format, storyline and character changes. It is now a much better show, more worthy of comparison to its sister show. SVU now has a ""law AND order"" format. The show is more balanced in its storylines, especially in its ""order"" part, due in large part to the addition of its own District Attorney, DA Cabot. We now see more courtroom scenes which helps the show come to a better conclusion.    There are also less scenes about the personal lives of the detectives, which is good and bad. As I mentioned before, I would have enjoyed equal time for all the characters in this respect, but since we have gotten to know them better already, it is not necessary for more background. Perhaps Mr Wolf will give this part of the show another chance, since it could be interesting, given the right stories. Finally, there are cast changes which are interesting. Detective Jefferies has been dismissed because of an indiscretion on her part: sleeping with a suspect. The opening show handled her dismissal by the Morris Commission, and the hiring of her replacement, Detective Tutuola, which was a great episode. Tutuola, played by former rapper now actor Ice-T, is a great addition to the cast. Ice-T has a great presence, and I look forward to the development of his character. DA Cabot, also a new addition, is a strong character and was definitely needed to balance the show. In conclusion, the new changes made to SVU are great! They improve the show and the storylines are more intriguing and engrossing than last season. Benson and Stabler make a great team. Munch and Tutuola have interesting possibilities. I never really enjoyed the pairing of Munch with Jefferies. Richard Belzer is such a great actor that his mere presence, let alone his great one-liners, often upstaged Michelle Hurd (Detective Jefferies). Belzer is now more evenly matched with Ice-T, and it shows. Finally, what can I say about Captain Cragen? Great role, great actor, he really holds his own. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit is now a great show, which I look forward to viewing every friday night. Thank you Dick Wolf, executive producer, for making this show as great as I knew it could be!"
136,"Ever since it premiered in 1994, Dick Wolf's ""Law and Order"" has been a massive hit. The shows are constantly on one channel or another, and all of them are great. In 1999, the franchise launched it's first spin-off, ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit,"" which dealt with sex crimes. Spin-offs don't usually last long, but ""SVU"" did and is still going strong. In fact, it's entirely reasonable to argue that it's first spin-off is better than its parent.The show revolves around the Special Victims Unit of the NYPD. The squad deals primarily with sex crimes. While the cast has changed a bit over the years, in general, there are four detectives and a lawyer they gather evidence for. The main detectives are Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay), John Munch (Richard Belzer), and Fin Tutola (Ice-T). The most prominent lawyers are Alex Cabot (Stephanie March) and Casey Novak (Diane Neal). Their captain, Donald Cragen (Dan Florek) is secondary, but appears in just about every episode. In the last few seasons, two regular guest stars have been added to the main cast: Melinda Warner (Tamera Tunie), the medical examiner, and George Huang (B.D. Wong), the FBI trained criminal psychologist.Like its parent show, ""SVU"" features strong stories and great acting. All the guest characters are well-acted. The dialogue and stories are intelligent, and they are unafraid of tackling new and difficult subject matter. The latter is easily the show's biggest strength. While the shows have the same feel, every episode feels fresh because they tackle new issues in different ways.""SVU"" has something that none of the other shows in the ""Law and Order"" franchise do: three-dimensional main characters. The two main detectives, Benson and Stabler, are frequently fleshed out, and three-dimensional. Their personal conflicts often influence how they react to a case, and this keeps the show interesting. For example, Stabler is Catholic, and a father of five, so crimes involving young girls frequently hit close to home for him. Benson is the product of a rape, and this influences how she tackles certain cases. Benson is especially good at talking to the victims, and this gives her a softer side that's easy to like. Munch (carried over from another Dick Wolf show, ""Homicide: Life on the Street""), is a conspiracy nut and frequently makes sarcastic jokes. Fin is a tough guy from narcotics, but he has a softer side as well.The show wouldn't be half as good if the main characters weren't well-acted. When I learned that Meloni's background is in comedy, I was shocked. There's no sense of that in his portrayal of Stabler. Stabler is a closed-off individual who tries to avoid letting the stress out to prevent pain for his family. He's a family man, and his time and effort into his work takes him away from them, and that is constantly on his mind. Mariska Hargitay is the show's best performer (and the only one from the franchise who has gotten any acting nominations (and wins)), and that's understandable. She's brilliant. Alternately sensitive and tough, Benson is easily the most dynamic character in the franchise. She frequently goes undercover, and Hargitay doesn't just act like the person her character is posing as, she plays it as Benson acting. Richard Belzer provides comic relief, but he is more than capable of handling drama. Ice-T is another rapper-turned-actor, but Ice-T is terrific as Fin.Despite the dark and disturbing subject matter, the show doesn't shy away from a sense of humor. Most episodes have a few good one-liners, some of which are laugh-out-loud hilarious. But the show is careful enough not to turn this into a comedy.Every episode is great. There are a few episodes that are flat (what show doesn't have these, especially one that has run this long?), but the great ones vastly outnumber those that are less-than-par. A good number of them are simply genius (""Design,"" ""Charisma,"" ""Raw,"" ""Scourge,"" ""Scavenger,"" ""Game,"" ""Tragedy,"" ""Debt,"" ""Doubt,"" ""Pure,"" and a few others).Make no mistake, ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit"" is simply incredible."
137,"One of the best cop series I've seen at least it is early on although The Wire is better Law and Order:SVU is great for what it is. The cast is spectacular, the acting is superb, and well made! The music is hilarious without meaning to be which is delightful. I like the mix of people that either hate the series later on or praise it. I'll definitely enjoy going through the bulk of the series. Gets better as it goes on I especially enjoy season 7!"
138,One of my favorites I could watch this everyday ...the cast is amazing it's just such a great show since the beginning I've been watching never missed an episode
139,"It's a staple in television now, and a great one. I cannot wait for the return of Chris Meloni! 🖤"
140,I love this show it's awesome we have watched this show from the beginning and now almost through season 20 now and loving it!
141,The cast regulars are always on point and the guest stars add to the excellence! I started watching from season one about 3 weeks ago and I'm hooked...again. I 💜 the assemble cast and have my favorites. This is my go to show...always and forever! I see or hear something new whenever I watch the show. My favorite guest star is Marcia Gay Harden!
142,"Law and Order: SVU was once a superb programme, but the latest episode shown here in Australia proves what willing pawns TV studios will be in the moral Crusade of the Ratbag Religious Right in the USA and its clones. It comprised an hour of the most vicious anti-lesbian propaganda I have seen in quite a while, all contained within an ostensibly ""even-handed"" story about a girl with two mothers, who was so relentlessly bullied that she finally hit back and attacked her tormentor.Let's see what came up:  A young girl lives with her biological mother and her mother's lesbian lover. This fact per se puts her in ""moral danger"" as far as the mother's parents and the child's school is concerned  the mother's lover is the cliché Evil Lesbian who is responsible for ""perverting"" the mother;  The girl is constantly tormented by a boy of her own age who tells her that her mother's lifestyle is ""against the law of god"" and that her mother and mother's lover will ""burn in hell."" He even physically assaults the girl to the extent of cutting her hair  a punishment that US religious loonies would feel appropriate for ""perverts"" and which Europeans felt appropriate for those who collaborated with the Nazis;  The boy is supported in his cruelty by his parents, a sanctimonious mother who ""prays for"" the girl, and a vicious animal of a father who refers to mother & lover as ""bitches"" & ""whores"" (If he came into MY court, I'd send him to a max security prison where he'd find out from one of the ""bruthaz"" what it was like to be a bitch and a whore);  The girl's mother is in psychiatric care  no doubt the constant harassment did a lot to put her there  so she is obviously the cliché Crazy Lesbian;  The mother's lover is legally unable to be the girl's guardian. Yet this is presented as ""cowardice""  when the CEO of a construction or drug manufacturing company refuses to take responsibility for the misery they cause, this is totally understandable to the Americanized mind, but a lesbian? COWARD!!!!  The lover is not only a ""coward"" but also a ""paedophile""  she is taking naked photos of the girl! And I thought we'd got over the ""baby-on-a-bearskin-rug"" scandal of the 80s and 90s! Her contention that she is trying to give the girl a sense of her own beauty does not hold water with the sleazy male detective  after all, a girl with a positive self image would not be susceptible to the blandishments of such as him, whose primary images of women are probably Mother, Wife & Whore;  When the girl has finally been pushed beyond the limits of endurance and retaliates by attacking her tormentor, HE and his holier-than-thou Christian family become the victims, and the entire coercive apparatus of the State swings into action to avenge the crime against them.So there you have it  lesbians are bad parents and Crazy or Evil (or both) to boot. Shame, Law & Order, shame! Yet I suppose I'm being too harsh  until US society digs itself out of the miasmatic sewer called Judaeo-Christian (and Islamic) morality, homophobia will be rampant in our media."
143,Friends and family warned me not to see this. They were right. Now i need psycologist to forget what i saw. Please stop making more of this. There are 100 more series that deserve new seasons.
144,"An extraordinarily annoying serie with a bunch of unsympathetic characters, especially the lead ones, one by one disappearing from the cast after exceeding their authority. Unlikely twists in the stories just to astonish the audience. Criminals let free due to sloppy police work while others go to jail of similar reasons. The announcement 'these are their stories' are from the beginning contradicted by that all is fictious. A few of the chapters are really watchable like the one with the rich runaway ending up in a slum-harem and that with the regretful though murdered by a mentor with the same urge. It is astonishing that Dick Wolf, father of such lovely series as Chicago PD, Fire, Med can have fathered this disgusting serie. Still: starting to watch one episode it is hard to quit."
145,"I started watching this show before I was sexual assault by a family member multiple times. After the first time I was assaulted I refused to watch this show and eventually got the courage to watch it again, in so many ways SVU has made living with my truth easier. Whenever I hear Mariska offering advice to a victim it always stays with me and touches my heart. The amount of love and dedication that the actors and producers etc put into this show is amazing, I truly wish this show lasts for a very long time. I can't ever binge watch SVU, because I have to pace myself because I know I'll start having PTSD after more then 2 episodes but I'm so so grateful for this show and the awareness it brings to the horror of rape of any person with any background or origin."
146,"The way SVU communicates how victims of sex crimes react and deal with the psychological impact is shown effectively and empathetically. I think it is especially important to address as the public has become more aware of these crimes as part of #metoo.
Some of the more recent reviews seem to ding the show as being too political in recent years - I don't see this issue as being partisan. I hope the show continues for a 21st season - the cast is excellent."
147,"Words cannot describe the amazing Plot of the show! It is so addicting, you just can't stop watching it! I don't have a favorite character because the entire cast is amazing! I was heartbroken when Detective Stabler left, but it was going to happen anyway. The characters are so attached to each other, they all share an unbreakable bond. They care for each other so much, that it sometimes gets in the way of their work. That, unfortunately is the reason detective Stabler left. Both he and Olivia cared for each other so much that when the man held a gun to Stabler's head, Olivia didn't to risk killing Stabler. They have gotten to know each other for so long, that it is heartbreaking to see them leave. I hope B.D. Wong will be coming back. He was an amazingly skilled, and well played character. Law and Order: Special Victims Unit not only is they best Law and Order ever made, it is the best show ever made! I can't wait for season 15!"
148,A well written and acted show that focuses way to much on the Stabler character. The Emmy bait material for Christopher Meloni has become embarrassing and over the top. The whole has been focused on his personal problems. Hargitay(Benson) is the heart of the show and will no doubt receive another Emmy nom this year. Her GG was well deserved and I'm sure it will not be her last. Belzer is sorely underused and could use a decent storyline. All in all its the Best L@O in the franchise and the most popular for a reason. I would like to see more stories involving Benson's background. That character is still an enigma after all these years.
149,"Aside from NBC's other tremendous hit show ""Third Watch"", I also enjoy Law & Order: SVU very much. In fact, I recently had the honor of working on ""SVU"" as a background actor. Although as a union (SAG) actor it would have been awesome to have gotten to utter at least a line or 2, I found it still terrific to be working alongside such a talented cast as Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay (as well as another actor, Kevin Jiggits); They were all truly awesome folks to work with and amazingly friendly and down to earth! (Chris has a cool sense of humor!! LOL!!) I'm featured in a scene with Chris (& Kyle Maclachlan of ""DUNE"" fame) as a NYC Police Officer who accepts a photograph from Det. Stabler (Chris Meloni)for ""processing""; I should be featured fairly prominently...I hope! (If I don't end up on the cutting room floor!!) LOL!! I'm looking forward to seeing how the episode turns out (scheduled for November 16th.)All in all, the series is terrific and deserves all the accolades it receives!"
150,"I really don't understand why so many people say that this is not a very good show. It is my favorite show. I love how it is different from the other shows, because the characters get to actually talk with victims, instead of them almost all being murder victims. I love the characters themselves, especially Benson and Stabler, and how the actors fit with the characters so well. Before I found this show I thought rape was wrong, of course, but never felt that much about it. Now that I have seen this show, especially with Olivia Benson (hargitay)I feel so much for rape victims. Really, now that I watch this show I really want to be a sex crimes detective. I'm still in school, but it would be my dream career. I give it a 10 without a doubt."
151,"This show was originally very clunky and obvious, with Mariska Hargitay's character setting up to be extremely annoying (an emotional woman whose tragic past made her a bad bet for working in the sex crimes unit). However, the show has tightened up considerably since then and her character is very believable and definitely the star of the show.  CHris Meloni, incredibly charismatic as Keller in Oz, is constrained by the limits of his character, a straitlaced family man whose responses are fueled by his own family situation.  I know in L&O shows, the plotlines are the stars, but it seems like Meloni's role could be re-written to give him a bit more of an edge or sense of humor.  Ice-T and Richard Belzer are great character acters, as is the guy who plays Kragen.  The psychiatrist is very believable, too, if a bit tooooo ""I'm OK, you're OK."""
152,"Of the three L&O series, this is probably the weakest.  Like the others, the acting is quite good.  And the writers do what they can with the general outline they have.  But that outline is the problem.How this gets higher ratings than L&O: Criminal Intent, i'll never know. They can't go anywhere with crimes of this nature.  The original L&O covers all sorts of things, while L&O:CI usually ties in bigger, more intricate happenings into murders.  But this...just watch one episode.  Then, you'll have the general idea of what every episode is like.  Not a very good show."
153,"I feel that this show has gone downhill some over time. Every episode has gotten over the top and hard to believe it seems. I must admit though I love the plot twists on occasion but I just wish that they were more believable is all. In my opinion things need to get better with Olivia and Stabler, it would be better to have more chemistry between the two and keep the show going I think.Also I really don't like Ice T much, he just doesn't act like a cop and seems to stretch things when he turns on his partners. It's almost as if he's expressing some disdain towards his own department out of some ideal. Also the way he talks to the captain at times is annoying and should have cost him his job. Without giving to much away I just feel that it would be better at some point to get rid of Ice T and replace him with someone else."
154,"Although the original Law and Order, imho, was a major yawner, SVU manages to capture my attention. I like the way this show gives the viewer some insight into the lives of the detectives and other main characters. The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because of the left-leaning bias of most of the shows that deal with controversial issues. Conservatives, whether politically or religiously, are usually portrayed as idiots or freaks who drive the perpetrators to commit their horrible crimes. As a writer myself, I know it is impossible to keep our own personal beliefs and biases from filtering into our writings. But a show that is played on national TV and probably in various other countries around the world, has a responsibility to be a little more fair in its portrayal of people of other beliefs. As it stands, L&O SVU is actually helping to foster hatred toward folks who happen to have more traditional views. I find this extremely irresponsible and disturbing at a time when conservatives such as anti-abortionists are being murdered in broad daylight simply for having the gall to make use of their first amendment right to freedom of speech. Tone down the anti-conservative agenda, and the show is one of the best police shows on TV."
155,"My husband met Ms. Tunie and her husband in Italy just last week. I just wanted to let everyone know that she is the sweetest most down to earth person and I had to try to find a way to let her know. CSI was already a favorite in our house but because she and her husband were just the nicest people, just a joy to talk to,CSI will remain a favorite in our house. Ms. Tunie it was a pleasure visiting with you and your husband and we hope that you two enjoyed your vacation to Italy, we sure did. I am not even sure this note will find you but I sure hope that it does. It is not everyday that folks from Arkansas run up on an actor, get to talk to them and really enjoy th visit. As a matter of fact, we felt bad because your husband let his ice cream melt to be able to visit with us. We truly enjoyed your time, thank you again.Thank you, Janice Nelson Warren, AR 71671"
156,"... as quite simply the best procedural show on network television. Each season it grows and becomes more daring, and by that I don't mean the sexual content which I find a little titillating (in a 'show it but don't show it' TV kind of way) but in terms of the emotional involvement of the characters. Meloni and Hargitay are two of the finest actors around, and their chemistry carries a lot of the lesser shows. Ice-T isn't really an actor, but he's fun to watch and doesn't take himself too seriously, even as he takes himself too seriously, if you know what I mean.Year by year this show has grown by leaps and bounds. My favorite episode of the last season was the one where Matthew Modine guest starred, and they seem to have shot the whole show mostly on one set. I'm sorry I can't recall the title of it, but it was superlative.Keep up the good work!"
157,"﻿Can someone please tell me how can the producers get rid of the first female Afro-American cop ever on Law and Order and give it to an ex-pimp like thug called Ice-T?Michelle Hurd (Det. Monique Jefferies) has beauty, intelligence, and an incredible acting ability which had so much potential. The only person who tied her place on the show was Mariska Hargitay (Detective Benson). Ice-T does not have that police image as the other detectives. It is a horrible plan for the writers to replace her to boost their ratings with a rapper.
She wasn't the problem. The show is gradually picking up ratings but it takes time to catch on. To throw a talented actress like Michelle Hurd is just plain stupid. NBC and USA had better make up for their stupid mistake by placing Michelle on another hit show I will definitely boycott this show."
158,"Other than the original ""Law & Order"" police-drama created by Dick Wolf, spin-off series ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" is the best. This series focuses on the SVU, a section of the New York Police Department that specializes in sexually-based offenses. Here, on the ""Law"" side, we're introduced to ultra-cool cop duo Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni), supported by John Munch (Richard Belzer) and Fin Tutuola (Ice-T) and watched over by Cpt. Donald Cragen (Dann Florek). Other supporting characters include M.E. Warner (Tamara Tunie) and Dr. Huang (B.D. Wong). On the ""Order"" side, we have ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal, who replaced ADA Alexandra Cabot, who was played by Stephanie March for five seasons). I think this is the highest-rated spin-off because it's the most accessible. We have characters we really like, and we're continuously showed their lives on and off the job, and I think that's what draws us in each week for more. I still occasionally read stories about how some of the actors on ""SVU"" are approached on the street by fans of the show and are told how much they mean to them. That's a mark of truly great television, don't you think?10/10"
159,"Law and Order SVU is my favorite TV show because of the characters, storylines and awesome things and twists"
160,"This is a consistently strong and thought provoking show. It has not lost its appeal over the year and maintain a vice like grip on its viewers. Great detective work, policing and procedural."
161,They are honest and truthful and bring light to the real crimes and how things should be within Law. I've never felt so connected to a show that makes you realise that there is hope out there and that the show will always be true to culture and the current crimes that are in the world today I'm grateful for the show and everything that they give to us
162,I have been watching this TV show since I was a child and it does not disappoint. Please watch it.
163,"Along with the rest of Dick Wolf's shows, i absolutely love this. SVU, Fire, Med & P.D are my ultimate fave shows everrrrrrr.... Love the characters old and new... devastated when a few of 'em left the show, more so when ADA Rafael Barba left 💔 😭 . Don't even think about leavin, Fin and Liv... lol Stories are gripping, sad and not always a good outcome, thus is life. The show keeps it real. The actors are amazing and their characters are really likable... Cannot praise this show enough..."
164,"This has bothered me like mad since day one: Whoever does makeup for this show puts red lipstick on the lips of any male actor under 18. Their lips are redder than the women! It's way overdone and looks absolutely ridiculous. I sure hope the director and makeup people of ""Law and Order SVU"" read this. Why is it necessary to make the lips of a 9 year old boy red? Now I don't mean as red as Marilyn Monroe's, but it is SOOOOOOO obvious they have reddish-pink lipstick on. Little girls on the show wear much less lipstick, and any male over 18 has nothing visible on his lips.Next ... what's happened to the Olivia Benson character? She's gotten ""softer"" and a little more psychologically vulnerable. Yet Fin is as tough-as-nails as ever. Double standard: Gotta soften up the women. In the episode where the female lawyer murders her kids and husband, Olivia is shedding tears. After 20 years on the job, she's suddenly doing this, when she has dealt with equally heinous crimes all along without such a reaction.The writers would have never had Olivia crying over a crime and hugging another crying female detective (Rollins) back in the early years of the series or even five years ago.But now her voice quivers and sometimes cracks, and she just doesn't have that steeliness.Fin, who's at least as old as Olivia, still gets rough-n-tough with suspects, but Olivia has been downgraded. I guess Hollywood STILL isn't ready for woman who's both middle aged and tough.The writers had Stabler beating the crap out of men twice his size, yet won't write a scene where Olivia decks a guy. She did this maybe in one episode years ago. If Stabler can be superhuman, why can't the women be in a scene where they kick butt?Oh, it's because of Noah, I'm sure. The whole thing with Noah is just so out of synch with the show."
165,"I know, you are going to make snide remarks about Texas people, so go ahead. I have been an avid fan of Mr. Thomas from his first airtime. His ""country boy"" remarks on Law and Order are only an example of his portrayal as the ""boss"" on the show. He has an air about him that if he said 'Martians have landed', I would hunt down my Grandfather's old 6 gauge shotgun, and start shooting! Mr. Thomas does not show superiority. He just is. I have taped every show on DVD. I love the whole Law and Order group. Monday and Tuesdays are filled with hours of shows, and I look forward with the excitement of Christmas Day. Mr. Thomas was an exciting addition on Die Hard II as the chief of the airport's control tower. With all heck breaking out, Mr. Thomas showed his calm, reassuring self. I know time moves on, as will Mr. Thomas. I'll miss him, but I have all those dvds."
166,"I caught this series on the Hallmark channel here in the UK about a year a go.  I remember watching an episode one night without knowing what is was all about.  From that moment I have been hooked.  It delves into the deepest and darkest sides of people and why they act the way they do - the programme manages to find a balance between entertainment and education, without being too voyeuristic.  I think the acting is wonderful - realistic and very insightful - I especially like the leads Meloni and Hargitey.  I know they are showing series 4 on US television.  It is a gutsey and unique drama series which continues to hold court amoungst the most popular shows in America.  I hope this series continues for a very long time."
167,"Till I grew up and started rewatching it on Amazon. Oh freaking God it's bad. First off no cop would be in the SVU unit that many years, because they will see everything is rape."
168,Enough already. Spare is the vomitus camerawork. You can't even focus on the show or story line when you're about to puke.
169,We love Law & Order SVU and have been watching it since the very beginning.Only complaint we have is that they tend to play the music (more than they ever used to) and it over-powers the actors. We lose a lot of the story because it is SO loud! PLEASE PLEASE turn down the music -- background music during a dramatic place is OK -- but keep it as background music -- they are dominating the show with it!!!Love the show - love the actors - love the storyline as much as we can follow it!
170,"This show is about the police of the Special Victims Unit' i.e., sex crimes. The crimes are more lurid, so this show might not be for everyone.Besides the regulars, there are cameos from the regular L&O cast."
171,"S20E23 openly smears real people. For some 3 seasons already it has been following strict political agenda but with this one gone all the way to islamphobia and even relating it to rep Ilahn Omar (with ""its all about benjamins"" line even). The worst thing is that that agenda produces lousy plots, weak characters and over all uninteresting piece of sh... television. And they even have ""fictional"". Guess, the best case scenario is that the writers are just tiered and with no inspiration. So just shut it down."
172,"This spin-off of ""Law & Order"" is extremely solid and every episode is always a pleasure to watch.The show is about a new elite squad of NYPD detectives who investigate sexually oriented crimes. So you would kind of expect that ever episode would be the same; someone gets raped and the SVU is send out to solve it. This however is not the case, every episode is extremely original. Kudos to that! OK so maybe the stories are pretty far fetched at times but that doesn't take away any of the quality of the show.Only real complaint I have about the series is that it misses a good solid main character. ""Law & Order"" had Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) and ""Law & Order: Criminal Intent"" has Robert Goren (Vincent D'Onofrio) but ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" doesn't have a good solid leading character. Neither Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni) or Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay) are interesting enough. Best characters are the ones that always play the smaller roles such as; Capt. Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), John Munch (Richard Belzer, that guy has got style! Hard to believe he is well over 60 years old already.) and Odafin ""Fin"" Tutuola (Ice-T). At first I didn't really liked Ice-T in this, I don't know for some reason he seemed nervous about acting in this to me but he now often gives away a very solid performance. The B.D. Wong character Dr. George Huang is a bit of a weird one to me, he is an all knowing character that truly knows everything and always has an answer and an opinion ready. He feels like a kind of unrealistic character to me, even though I really always have liked B.D. Wong as an actor. I'm also glad Alexandra Cabot (Stephanie March) got replaced by ADA Casey Novak (Diane Neal), she is a way better character!The show is very likable to watch. The guest appearances are like in all ""Law & Order"" series, always top-class and the fact that the show lacks a good main character doesn't take away any of the quality of the show.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
173,Love this show. Olivia is the perfect character and I'd totally want to be friends with her.
174,Even as a straight man. I can say that Benson serves as a symbol for strength in women. Having watched the show for 10 years now and seen likely 95%+ of the episodes from her partnership with Elliot (my favorite wish he'd come back) as a young inexperienced detective to a force to be reckoned with. She developed from an actor playing a role. To a social figure 20 years later. No one could've seen this coming
175,"This is the best crime show you will ever see, especially the first couple of seasons. The show has such an emotional impact on the viewers that it feels like you are part of the detectives lives. The show messes with your emotions in a positive way. You feel the pain of the victims and feel the anger in the detectives. The show has dropped off in recent years since the departures of stabler, cragen, munch, but occasionally you will still get a great emotional episode. Also, the show is filmed in New York which is a plus. You see the sights and sounds of this great city. The first 6 seasons are the greatest stretch of episodes you will ever see in a crime drama. I recommend that you watch those seasons as soon as possible. Trust me, this show will not disappoint you like the other cheesy police dramas nowadays."
176,"I have seen the pilot for this show, and it was more than I could take. It's as if the makers are trying to make an NYPD Blue version of Law & Order. And what's this ""special victims"" stuff? All this seems to be is an excuse to discuss the state of the murder victim's underwear, and ""politically correct"" (yeah, right) speeches onmen's attitudes to women.Law & Order itself has a lot of problems, but it is basically a good series and has been for a long time (especially after they dumped George Dzundza, who I detest).Dan Florek (who got the boot from L&O alongside Richard Brooks, both unforgivable) seemed quite lost. As for the other actors, I hate recent trend for American shows to cast models instead of actors in cop and action series (Soldier Of Fortune, etc.).Anyway, I hope this show gets canned and that the makers spend more time making Law & Order work (the plotting seems slightly rushed, of late)."
177,Love love love this show.... always has a dramatic show that represents real life day-to-day activities.
178,"This is the only TV Show I watch. Sometimes I re watch the episodes on the app. Yes, that's how much I love this show. Olivia is my hero."
179,"I've been watching Law & Order SVU for a while and usually enjoy it. The last two episodes though, shown at the end of November, 2005 regarding abortion and the beginning of Decemeber, 2005 regarding having two Lesbian mommies appear to be very political. You've managed to alienate all but a few organizations in these episodes. The abortion episode annoyed and concerned me. The two Lesbian mommies episode irritated me to the point of not watching the ending. Both shown in a row have only told me that KNBC is gearing up for the next election. I have decided to stop watching the program altogether. I will watch other programs on other networks designed for what T.V. is actually for. That would be Entertainment, in case KNBC has forgotten."
180,"Quality is the foundation that ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" is based upon as it luminates from the screen each hour it is on every night.Dick Wolf has once again combined quality writing with quality casting. Mariska Hargitay, Christopher Meloni, Ice-T, Dann Florek, B.D. Wong and Richard Belzer all share one thing in common: they star in one of finest series on television.Mariska, Chris, Ice-T, Dann, B. D. and the now departed Stephanie March are a well-rounded cast that compliment each other well. Furthermore, the cast is so good portraying their characters that I have to remind myself that they are actors not detectives.Quality writing and outstanding performances set ""Law And Order: SVU"" apart from the other dramas on television. Each episode is riveting, written with intelligence, and character driven. It is a privilege to watch ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.""The writers' ability to draw viewers in and make them care about the involving storylines and characters help to make ""Law & Order: SVU"" one of the finest legal series on television. EVERYONE MUST WATCH."

182,"I agree that the subject matter of this show is not for the weak-hearted, and can see that it could be construed as a combination of previous cop shows.  However, having worked out the awkwardness of any show's first couple of seasons, this one is now top of the line. The addition of Detective Munch from ""Homicide: Life on the Street"" and Ice-T as Fin Tutuola have brought the cast near to perfection.  The ethical quandaries faced by the detectives, the empathy they face with specific cases and the stereotypes they must face down are the stuff of Greek tragedy.  I feel this is one of the best shows ever put on television, and that it will continue to be so for seasons to come."
183,"This version of LAW & ORDER, which focuses on sexually-based offenses, has the same intelligent but disturbing stories as the original. There's also an interesting thread that surfaces from time to time concerning one of the investigators, Olivia Benson, who's a child of a rape and is constantly confronted with the question of whether she's inherited a rapist's mentality, and how that mentality might manifest itself in her. However, those who particularly like the courtroom aspect of the original should be advised that it's absent from the majority of SVU episodes, which usually end with the suspect being caught.  More importantly, some of the crimes are so extremely heinous -- as my brother-in-law likes to say, ""heinously heinous"" -- that SVU occasionally verges on pandering. As of the date this review was posted, it hasn't crossed that line, but it's dangerously close."
184,"I'm binge watching now, I'm at season 7 and I really believe is one of the best tv series ever! I watch many shows but this is so addictive. I don't know yet why Stabler is off the picture, I'm waiting to see what happens. No internet search spoilers, the show is so good, I don't want to spoil the fun."
185,Each episode leaves you on the edge. I love that you can sit and solve it along with them and see the step to step in each episode
186,It's more of my wife show but I get stuck Watching it... Within 10 minutes you already know who the bad guy is and they're gonna get him no matter what... The show seems in courage and flatter the Idea of Officers breaking the law to get Justice no matter what.... I mean the last one I watched . The girl was a minor but legally married in another state... And the judge and the detectives allowed them to pursue and harass till they got the case solved...
187,"In real life, everyone in law enforcement is deeply flawed. DAs sometimes prosecute in order to make a name for themselves with higher office in mind. Police arrest on flimsy evidence, they shoot innocent people, they take bribes, railroad a suspect and stop following up leads or exculpatory evidence because they don't want to start from scratch. Sometimes, the guilty party is never found. I wish once in a while Olivia Benson and others would screw up a case in the last minute due to one of these personal flaws, because in real life this sort of thing happens. In 1996, Richard Jewell became a suspect in the bombing of the Olympics in Atlanta. The FBI even tried to pressure Jewell into giving up his Constitutional rights. He was later found to be innocent, but not after being tried in the media. In 2006, the Duke Lacrosse team was charged with rape by the DA Nifong and later found not guilty."
188,Yeah well i'd expect tv shows like that would be more realistic (mainly becuse it's from the early 2000's before the media hipe over forensics and.... )but over all nice clasic and sure why not watch... if you see it on tv otherwise i won's suggest you'd try to find it/... not horrible ut also nothing spcial..
189,I have been watching this show since their first season. I have always wanted to help victims come to justice and this show does just that. I am looking forward to my careers in sex crimes and putting those offenders. Law and Order: SVU doesn't compare to any other law and order TV show. I have always been touched by SVU. I hope other enjoy this show as much as me. I hope they will be around as long as the original law and order has been plus longer. I wish they would do more cases doing a one hour episode. I also think they should play new episodes more than once a week. I do understand it takes time to make the episodes. I believe they need more detectives on the SVU episodes. I Love this show and will also watch it everyday.
190,"OMG i may only be 13 years old but i already like law&order SVU i hate law&order CI its not that its different but i like detective Benson and Stabler, fin etc. Its much better well i g2g(gots to go) but i promise i will definitely write back because i love you guys so much. I mean the things that you guys do is so awesome i like your Mexican episodes well because i am Hispanic but i am still am really glad to be born in the USA. if you guys were to choose which episode do you like better write back to me at lady_joker_89883@yahoo.com i'll be waiting for your answer. l8z(laters) That is my way of saying good bye to you all bye-bye"
191,Used to be the best show on tv. Has since sold out to appease the social justice warriors. I'll still to the re-runs.
192,Love show I hate when someone leaves Olivia old partner and Munch very faithfull to their fans
193,I just binged season 21 and it is incredible. I adore the changes like adding Kat and making Carisi the new ADA. Just wow. This show is addicting and I hope it never ends. I am impressed at how consistently well executed everything is from the acting to the wardrobe to the storyline to the editing.
194,"I've loved the show from day one. It's still good and really stands out from mediocre shows.But the new character ""Kat"" is truly terrible. She's played by the worst actress I've seen on such a big show in years. She can't act. Everytime she speaks, I'd rather listen to.... well anything basically."
195,"In as much as I have thorough enjoyed Law & Order: SVU over the years, I find that I am upset with the darkness of the entire Season 20. I thoroughly disliked the underhanded, manipulative, double-dealing, actions of Rob Miller, the Judge, and the hidden agenda of the Captain in S20 : E18.No Attorney, Judge, or Police Captain should be above the law, and as pillars of justice and law, their actions should always be above reproach.I give Season 20 a total of 5 stars."
196,"Really? this episode was so out of line.... if women want to be stupid - and I am a woman.You cannot judge and take to trial a guy like this. In real life Lt. Benson is totally guilty for the death of the son and there must be some strange thing going in the head of the writers or they are out of ideas, but his episode was totally unnecessary. Selling the body for favors is what we call a prostitute and these moms are exactly that, subconsciously they are looking for sex and now they have an excellent excuse. I am/was a fan of this series till yesterdays episode. Unbelievable. And if the next one is something like this last one. Good bye.SVU 18x04 - Heightened Emotions this is the last episode for me with this series. The writers keep destroying lives, in such a stupid way that I have decided this is it. No more Benson. Pity ... I looked for it for many years. Byeee!"
197,"This is one of the first spin-offs from the Law and Order series. It deals with a unit of detectives that have to investigate sexually oriented crimes such as rape, torture, paedophilia, child abuse. What is a first is we don't just see the affect the crimes have on the victims but also the police that have to deal with sick people who commit these perverted crimes. I think it helps that we see these detectives as human beings who have to see all these bad things at work and have to go home and try not to let it affect their lives but we see it isn't that simple and it leaves them scarred and not really being able to share this with other people but with each other.The cast are wonderful. I can't sing their praises enough, I do think that they all deserve awards as it is a hard job they have to do. They have great chemistry and work well off one another. The cast includes Christopher Meloni (Elliot Stabler) who I think is often overlooked and deserves an award. He is an ex-military man who has worked in this unit a long time and has to balance the traumas he sees at work with his family life at home and who can never talk about his work with them as he doesn't want it to affect their lives. With all that he sees, he still wants to do his job and stop the people who prey on the innocent. Mariska Hargitay (Olivia Benson) is a child of rape who can't let go of the fact that her father raped her mother. Mariska has definitely deserved the awards she has received. Richard Belzer (John Munch), Dann Florek (Donald Cragen) who like Belzer appears as the same character in other crime dramas. I wasn't sure about Ice-T (Fin Tutuola) but he has grown on me. Also, B.D. Wong as Dr. George Huang and Diane Neal as A.D.A Casey Novak add to the talented cast.The programme is not scared to tackle the hard issues that affect people and they do it in an unflinching way. The stories are disturbing, emotional, often horrific but I think we need to see a show like this to address the audience and say this does happen in the real world and the people involved can't switch off the programme and forget about what they have gone through, they do not have that option. I do think we need to be reminded how lucky we are and this show reminds us of that but also puts a human face on the police."
198,"I've only started watching this show, a few months ago.  But now I watch it avidly every night.  I must say however that I am quite bias to this show, in the few months that I have had the pleasure of getting to know it's plotlines and characters.I must say from all of the other Police shows that are out there, this one is a tad bit different.  Due to the nature of the show the 'sex crimes' which on all Police shows that I know to be out there are focused on 'Homicide'. The show's quality has increased in years as most shows usually tend to do, in the first season I'll admit it wasn't that great.  The quality of the show in the way that it looked appeared to be something out of the early 90's.  When I was later supprised to find out that it actually premired in 99.As for the actual characters on the show, I rather enjoy them.  I'm quite parial to Benson, Stabler, and Munch.  I love the cold hard reality of this show, it's dripping in horrifing crimes.  I doesn't hide the fact about certain disturbing topics.However, I think that they could focus a little more on the personal lives of the detectives as others have mentioned.  To really identify with a character you need to develop them and get to know them.  The Law & Order series writers really seem to take a damn slow time doing it.As for the character Cassidy I never really cared for the character, I suppose I just felt he was taking up space.  But one thing that really bugs me is the beginning of the show, there is a always a shot of the entire cast.  Which I absolutely dispise, it's so incrediably cheesey.I think it's a great spin-off, and I say the stranger the better! I just love this show..."
199,"There's a lot of potential in this show.  I watched it regularly in the beginning of the season and am seriously considering ditching Ally McBeal (which has gone the way of the absurd) for this show.  It could use a little more polish, a lot more Det. Munch and some ORDER.  They've brought Carmichael (Angie Harmon) around a couple times, but never as the other half of the show.  She's always in a supporting role.  This isn't really a fault or even a point where the show is failing, it's just not what the title claims it to be.  As for Mariska Hargitay, who seems to be taking quite a tongue lashing in the other comments, is concerned, she's green definitely, but she's improving.  The talent is there.  She was placed in a show with actors who are considerably more experienced than she and so her weak points are far more noticeable.  Look for Benson to lighten up in the future.  It's tough to be the new kid and a woman in a seasoned and male dominated cast, but once she hits a comfortable level she'll start to improve, hopefully.  A similar situation happened with Gillian Anderson of the X-Files, an emmy and two Golden Globes later I think she's doing ok."
200,"I just saw the pilot last night and I must say , IT'S SO MUCH BETTER THAT ""LAW AND ORDER""! ""Special Victims Unit"" main stars(Meloni & Hargitay) have such great compatibility on tv. I surely do hope that they can develop a romantic fling for one another ."
201,"This show could have easily been offensive and insensitive, but the stories are handled very well. I would say that it appears to be quite realistic; some of the victims are bad in themselves, or just plain idiots. Sometimes the outcomes of the cases are not what you would expect, but that's true in real-life, too. Sometimes the bad guys win, sometimes you are never quite sure if the defendant is actually guilty or not. Sometimes even the police and the judges are the bad guys!The show could be tough and upsetting viewing for particularly sensitive people, so I would use discretion before watching. However, although it appears to highlight flaws within the justice system, it shows what an uphill, unbeatable slog they go through to try and bring that justice to deserving victims. Whatever your opinion, the show is certainly gripping and one of my favourites."
202,This has to be my favourite programme on TV... The shocking story lines and we'll rounded characters make for an amazing show! Olivia keeps SVU in check while they hunt for the predators of New York...Highly tense and keeps you on the edge of your seat! Best programme Ever!!!
203,"CBS has always led the broadcast pack in legal and police dramas since television began. So it's no surprise that L&W/SVU conclusively proves that when you combine truly great story lines, scripting, acting and directing, you can bet it will be both professionally and popularly acclaimed.Guaranteed to not only entertain but most importantly-culturally and socially enlighten.May they continue for many years to come."
204,"Despite the newer seasons, I can't give this show anything less than 10 out of 10. It's a classic. The older seasons definitely make up for it.Seasons 5 & 6 were hands down my favorite; the whole team worked great together, everyone was in their prime and everything just flowed. If you want to give this show a shot but want to avoid some of the cheesiness of the first seasons, start there.The courtroom scenes are so over-the-top unrealistic, but in the campiest way so you can't help but love it! The drama is thick and delicious, with many mic-drop moments throughout the series-passionate, angry confessions sobbed out on the witness stand are common, but always manage to surprise and delight.The gritty realness of the earlier seasons are very much appreciated. They leave the viewer with a profound sense of discomfort-a reminder that our legal system still has many flaws; constant vigilance is required of our public servants, and we have our own civil obligation to hold them accountable.There's plenty of action, with tense courtroom drama to even it out. Sometimes there's even explosive action in the courtroom! It's not boring, the pacing keeps you engaged, and the lingo is accurate enough while still being really easy for the average person to understand. Of course, it's not without it's faults, but in my humble opinion SVU's faults are what make it, well... SVU!The bad acting, repetitive themes (like dockworkers who won't stop stacking crates to talk to the murder police), corny one-liners, and silly interpretations of real world stuff like Facebook and Reddit, etc only make this show more wonderful. It adds a certain flair, some personality.It all blends together into a fantastic show with action, drama, plot twists, character development, and real world references that make you think.Overall, I highly recommend this show. It's a great show for binge watching on the couch, and it's equally as great to have on in the background while you putter around."
205,"Yes I gave it a 10, but that was for season 1-12. Be honest now the show was what it was because of the relationship as partners Stabler and Benson had. Was Meloni really asking that much money for what he contributed to the show's ratings. I give it until the end of the season and that will be it for SVU. The limit of 10 lines is immensely annoying, I have nothing more to say, why is there a minimum of words for reviews? Mere nonsense if you ask me. You board members truly do need to amend your policies pertaining member television or movie reviews. Done, finished, all out of opinions on this television series. Am at a loss, and very upset with your unreasonable policies."
206,"""LAW & ORDER: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT,"" in my opinion, is a pure definition of must-see TV! Despite the fact that I've never seen every episode, I still enjoy it. It's hard to say which episode is my favorite. However, I get kind of squeamish whenever some accident victims are brought in. As a matter of fact, I think just about every single episode I've seen is touching. Everyone always gives a good performance, the production design is spectacular, the costumes are well-designed, and the writing is always very strong. In conclusion, even though it can also be seen in syndication now, I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good."
207,"The first (and still the best) spin-off from the ""Law & Order"" franchise, has to do with a unit of Detectives that deal exclusively with sex crimes. It deviates from it's father shows tried and true structure of half police work, half courtroom drama, in such that it's about 85 to 90 percent detective work and the personal lives of the various Detectives are cannon fodder from the get go. It's as well acted as the show it spun off from (well the main characters, at least, some of the guest stars and day players not so much) and is as riveting, if darker show. One of the few shows that actually gets better with each subsequent season (thus far at least) makes this one to catch every week.My Grade: A Season 1 Extras: A promo for L&O: SVU on the USA network; and Trailers for ""Traffic"" the mini-series, Steven Spielberg's""Taken""; & a trailer for the L&O 2: all or nothing video game Season 5 Extras: 4 Featurettes (focused on Ice-T, B.D. Wong, Dann Horek, & the special guest stars respectively)"
208,"I have been a Law & Order fan since the beginning, but of the three Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is the best.. Why you may ask? I believe that it is the relationships amongst the characters that makes it stand out from Law& Order (the original) and Law & Order Criminal Intent. Olivia & Elliot, Munch & Finn and the interaction between the two pairs is what makes Special Victims Unit different from the others. Its not just about the cases, its about the depth of friendship between the main members of the cast. They're a team, and the bonds between them is the heart of the show. If you're not just interested in gore, fast wordplay & crime, but also the more human side of the crime fighters lives, then this is the show for you."
209,"In recent years there have been so many police dramas and most of them focus on homicide detectives, but SVU is somewhat rare in a sense that it focuses on sexual crimes, which are much tougher to watch. In addition it follows the case through court in most cases and shows the trial - a part which most crime dramas leave out.The acting is amazing and true, for years Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler bring it to life. To say the chemistry between those two is perfect as well as the balance between them. Every other character around them brings something of their own to the mix making the show so good. They are all different and they do the job with different reasons. I'm certain that everybody can find someone to relate to. All of the characters are very well written and for some it takes seasons to figure out what are they fighting for and why. It's truly a show that puts solving the crime first and detective's personal life second or even third. True, there is some sexual tension, but it is always in the back. The story lines don't get old and they reflect our reality. It's only in recent years that feminism had rose again and sexual crimes against women are brought to greater light, but SVU tells the same stories from a decade ago. Still not all the victims are young females and the variety of the crimes, the reasons behind it and the results - in this show it's usual for the victim to be alive.In conclusion I'd say that it's an amazing show, a must go for every crime show lover. It gives a reality check and a different perspective into the crime solving.Plus Olivia Benson is truly well written character, who has become an inspiration to many. She is fictional, but I'd love to see a detective her passion in every police precinct."
210,"Episode""dolls"" should have ""fin'in the starring role not stabler please give credit where credit is due ice was in the leading role with hargitay"
211,"The one thing that continues to set Law and Order SVU from the rest of the pack is the compelling and emotional story lines, the actors and how each and every episode manages to keep you on the edge of your seat as these heart wrenching story's are told. I for one thought that the axing of Christopher Meloni (Elliot Stabler) would be detrimental to the show as the dynamic partnership between him and Mariska Hargitay (Olivia Benson) was one of the sole reasons the show was so successful over the past 12 years. However I was proved wrong and have to say I was extremely impressed with the performance by Danny Pino (Nick Amaro) who completely outshone his counterpart Kelli Giddish (Amanda Rollins) i'm afraid to say despite how much I tried to warm to her character. I also thoroughly enjoy watching the courtroom/prosecuting end of the show which always somehow manages to surprise me and enthrall me with twists and turns as cross examinations always seem to turn these seemingly slam dunk cases on their head All things considered this is an excellent programme which really has everything that a show needs to truly captivate an audience from start to finish. P.S The show also features Ice-T mean who doesn't love Ice-T"
212,"Please include Tamara Tunie's character, Dr. Warren, in more episodes! Where is she? I miss her. At first, I did not think I would like watching Law and Order (SVU) because of the numerous casting changes that seemed to occur at the same time, but the show is still good. The show still has a nice ensemble-feel to it, unlike Law and Order (CI) that focused too much on the lead detective with the Psychology background. The entertainment business, occult, scientific-tinged, and the social-cause motivations for committing the crimes are the most interesting. NBC, do not move this show to another night -- I like Wednesdays!"
213,"The focal point of the series has always been the detective team of Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson. They work in the special victims unit aka the sex crimes unit of the NYPD, also in the unit are John Munch(who alter on becomes a Sergeant), Odafin Tutuola and Captain Cragen. The show covers pretty every angle of sex crimes and child abuse, really bringing the stories home. IMO this is the best of all the L&O series, none of the rest of the L&O series really let you know the main characters as well as SVU does. In the main L&O show you don't really learn all that much out about the detectives outside of what they do for a living."
214,"for me,this is the best of the Law and Order Franchise.i really like the good mix of characters.they are well written and defined and the show goes in depth with them,both in their professional and personal lives.the show is also very edgy,and dark.it pushes the envelope.plus,there's more action than the original Law and Order,and Law and Order:Criminal Intent.i find the original Law and Order to be more of a procedural drama,so it's more about the drama.as for Law and Order:Criminal Intent,i find it lacks the edge of SVU.both of those other shows have their merits,but for me,Law and Order:Special Victims Unit is the best of the bunch."
215,"I agree with other reviewers that this is one of the best cop shows on television. What particularly makes it for me is that the makers are rarely satisfied with simple black and white. Rather, everything is painted in shades of grey.With most cop shows, at the end, you know that the bad guys have been caught, the good guys have done their job, and all is right with the status quo. Here, characters question what they are doing, they argue, and in many episodes the questions are not comfortably resolved.This is a show that is not afraid to deal with controversies: the ability of a person with a learning disability to give consent, abuse and discrimination against people with mental health problems, what the limits are to responsibility for ones actions. It raises the questions, and trusts its audience not to need a pat solution.It is not surprising that this gets far fewer viewers than the CSI franchise. Depressing, but not surprising. It is, though, of far more value."
216,"Producer/Creator Dick Wolf had tried some other shows after the initial success of the original LAw and Order(""Mann and Machine"",""Crime and Punishment""--not based on the famous Russian novel),but his decision to simply take the same formula from L&O and re-direct the nature of the crimes and the investigations made this show FAR more pliable and,as such,has kept it easily popular and watchable,allowing it to coast into a ninth(so far)season.The Major Sex Crimes Unit is fronted by detectives Elliot Stabler(Chris Meloni,getting to shed his nasty character from ""Oz"") and Olivia Benson(Marisha Hargitay),and is backed by fellow detectives Fin Tutola(Ice-T,with one of the coolest voices in ALL show biz!),John Munch(Richard Belzer,now as the same character for sixteen years and on his way to joining rare company as James Arness' Matt Dillon and Kelsey Grammar's Dr.Frazier Crane!)and Captain Donald Kragen(Dann Florek,in a character originated in the original L&O). They've explored and prodded a whole unsavory variety of nasty cases,many NOT involving murder(at least not directly)but still highly disturbing. Other support comes from the police analyst Dr.George Huang(B.D.Wong)and the ADAs(Stephanie MArch and Diane Neal). While the cases seem to be lifted so cleanly off the headlines(and this applies perhaps more so with the original; L&O) that one has to be in some disbelief as to how they can have uncanny resemblance to actual cases,originate in NYC and still somehow not be considered to be ""coincidental"",if taken for their own right,these stories are still effective and will linger in your brain sometimes for days,weeks,indefinitely after you watch them! Powerful stuff,indeed.Worth a look either on NBC(Current run:Tuesday nights,10/9c)or in syndication(usually USA Network),this show by far seems to show much more interest in the characters that make up the branch of law enforcement working these cases than the other two shows. I think that's what makes it as easily popular as it is and probably helps make the interest in the cases all the more palpable. Ther performances by Meloni,Hargitay and Ice-T in particular are quite evocative.Belzer's Munch doesn't have quite has as much to bring here as he did on the very missed ""Homicide:Life on the Street"",but his dark dry humor and sharp wit is VERY appreciated here.Watch any of the three shows and then,when considering this one,see if you don't agree."
217,"Quality is the foundation in which great television is based upon. Dick Wolf creates great television with his creation of the ""Law & Order"" franchise. Wolf crafts ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" in such a way that draws me in with compelling story lines, character driven performances and a first-rate cast who have great chemistry with one another.Mariska Hargitay, Christopher Meloni, Ice-T, Dann Florek, B.D. Wong and Richard Belzer are a well-rounded cast that bring great depth to their characters and compliment each other very well. The cast has done such a great job with their characters that I find myself caring what happens with them. I have to remind myself that they are actors not real detectives.Quality writing and excellent performances set ""Law And Order: SVU"" apart from the other dramas on television. Each episode is riveting, written with intelligence, and character driven. It is a privilege to tell everyone that I watch ""Law & Order: Special Victims Unit"" with great admiration."
218,"SVU is, without a doubt, one of the greatest shows I've ever seen! With its amazing cast, and unbeatable plot, this show draws you in, from the moment you turn on USA, and it keeps you guessing until the end. Christopher Meloni, Mariska Hagitay, and Richard Belzer grasp you're attention as they unravel the various 'sexually based offenses, and hate crimes set before them. There are also many other crucial cast members, such as B.D. Wong, who plays a psychologist, who 'gets into the mind' of the victims and offenders, to help solve the cases, and Tamara Tunies, who plays a Medical Examiner who examines bodies, to determine many important details about the crimes. I recommend this show to anyone who likes mysteries and investigations. This show will definitely hold your interest! My cousin and I spent nearly all of New Years Eve watching a marathon of this exciting show. Excellent work Mr. Wolf!"
219,"So the Law and Order stable continues to expand. Original Law and Order, SVU, Criminal Intent and soon Trial By Jury. We'll have to wait for Trial... but of the current three, Criminal Intent stands out like a sore thumb. A hallmark of Law and Order is the ensemble acting of each show, each episode. Special Victims Unit is no exception, achieving a laudable balance between its nominal stars (Meloni and Hargitay) and other cast members. Each actor is given the opportunity to carve a fully rounded character, even the minor regulars like Tamara Tunie. The same can be said of original Law and Order, regardless of cast changes over the years. Watching L&O and SVU makes me realize how much Criminal Intent strikes a bum note. Characters on the former two shows complement each other, even when friction or tension is written into scripts. In Criminal Intent, there is no balance - how Kathryn Erbe carries on is a mystery. Erbe is as fine an actor as Hargitay, but is rarely allowed to carry screen time. SVU rarely disappoints. The 'D'Onofrio' Show rarely pleases.Weird!"
220,Law & Order: Special Victims Unit follows the work of the unit in New York that investigates sexually based crimes. I disagree with the previous user's comments. I find Criminal Intent the weaker of the three as I prefer not to know who the criminal is until nearer the end. The actors are all well cast and portray the characters convincingly while most crimes are believable.Its all down to preferences. If you prefer actually seeing the crime first then you should watch Criminal Intent but SVU is more like the original Law & Order than anything else. I give SVU 4 stars ****
221,"Law and Order: SVU is the best show ever. The acting is terrific and the writing is flawless. I don't know how they do it. Mariska Hargitay is my favorite actress and she is brilliant in this show. Hands down the best of the entire cast. Christopher Meloni is extremely talented and is so convincing. Richard Belzer is perfectly cast. Dann Florek is great as well. I'm sorry to see that Stephanie March left the show. Next to Mariska, she was one of my favorites. I hate this Diane Neal. What's up with her. She's terrible. Her acting is the worst I've seen in a long time. To sum it up, this show ROCKS!!"
222,"I'm a huge fan of SVU. The show tells it like it is and doesn't hold back to try to soften the impact of some of the storylines. I think the actors are all great and developing more as the show continues. I'd like a bit more of a personal side for them all though. I like the fact that it is not set out the same as the original show, because to be honest half the time I feel like turning Law & Order off as soon as the courtroom crap starts because it can get downright boring. This would have to be my pick of the three shows, followed by Criminal Intent then L&O. I'm hearing a lot of talk about the show being cancelled lately and I hope it doesn't happen........it would be a big mistake."
223,"Like most fans of this show (I would imagine), I watched the original L&O for many years and decided to give SVU a try.  I initially did not take to it well and I didn't really go back to it for a few seasons.  However, I've recently begun watching it again and I really enjoy this program.As a L&O fan from the get-go, I always really enjoyed the ""split"" format of the show.  But I often wished that more time was spent on the police part of the show rather than the legal part.  I also wished that they'd spend more time showing what the characters are like when they aren't doing police work.  I rememeber one of my favorite episodes of L&O was the ""off-duty"" one which unfortunately ended in Claire Kincaid's death way back in the early years.  But it was a good episode because you got a better ""feel"" for the characters.  SVU satisfies both of my needs in that sense then because you get to see more of the police work part in addition to getting to see more of the main characters in different lights.  For example, Stabler's family frequently plays a role in the show and Benson's committment to victims and victim's rights is also always evident.  Different episodes also come up which cast more light on their personal stories.  Benson and Stabler are a great team and I would say are right up there for ""dynamic duos"" from recent tv, say with Mulder & Scully (X-Files), Harm and Mac (JAG), etc.  They are characters who are interesting and you really care what they do and what they are about.There are numerous other reasons why SVU is a great show of course. Story, production values, scenery and setting are a few obvious ones. Interesting and familiar characters would be another.  Another personal high point for me though is the return of Dan Florek as Don Cragen.  I think its great they brought him back from the early years of L&O when it was Mike and Max and then Mike and Phil.  He just seems like a police captain doesn't he?Anyway, SVU is a great show for any fan of L&O and of course a real winner for dramatic television in general."
224,"I've seen many shows in the investigating crimes- prosecuting criminals genre and Law & Order manages to carry on Law & Order's tradition by being one of the very best in its field. This show is definitely not for too sensitive people. Every episode brings forth and depicts a different form of the scum of this world and unbelievably horrid acts, and it does so in a dramatic and very convincing (often a bit too realistic) way. In their possibly morbid minds the writers dig into these deeds nobody wants to believe are conceivable and the reasons that people do them. Unlike Law & Order, Special Victims Unit gives more screen time to the detectives and less for the lawyers, which actually makes it more interesting (if you want to watch interesting lawyers, `The Practice' is the best show for that). Like the regular Law & Order, the cases and the stories are the most important elements, and not the detectives. We don't get many personal stories. Law & Order: Special Victims Unit is a series that's worth watching. Very interesting stories, very unpredictable, very professional. One of the best."
225,This show should be studied in film school for its screen play. Coz the actors aint exceptional but the show comes out in flying colors.
226,"We still love this show. Yes, it is formulaic and it has been on for a very long time, but it is sort of an institution for those of us who grew up watching it all these years. It is light years ahead of the other L&O series, and deals with the grittier, more appalling subject matter of rape, child molestation, incest, taboos, and all manner of bizarre sex-related crimes. The original L&O is so boring I have never even made it through one episode. Criminal Intent is OK, but it is a bit boring as well, and more like the sanitized one you watch with your parents or kids. SVU is the gritty one with warped sexual cases that you curl up on the couch with your significant other to watch late at night, and try to figure out who the perpetrator is and why the hell people would do such bizarre things. SVU has rough subject matter, but being a network regular show, it can't really be too obscene or gory, so it is a bit sanitized by default. The acting is pretty good, and Ice-T is fun to watch, as well as the others. Even with a changed cast, we still enjoy SVU today. They could use a bit more action at times, though, and we actually kind of dislike the newer episodes where Liv has that adopted son. It seems to detract from the stories, and the kid is more of a distraction than a real part of the story and a character you care about. He is like a background prop, and Liv's whining about him is annoying at times. Maybe I'm too cynical, but he doesn't fit for some reason.In a world of crime dramas, SVU is probably my favorite, and it has a good mix of everything, and draws you in with a subject that fascinates all humans-- sex, and the motives and ultimate ends that materialize around it."
227,This shows is everything !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
228,"With no hesitation, I can jump straight to the point to say that Law and Order: SVU is the top show to have ever been on television. I have never been obsessed with a certain thing/show for so long. Since age 12, I have continuously watched this show, as it is recorded on my TiVo set. I have viewed every episode, and with that, can truthfully say that Law and Order: SVU is a show like no other. The show is based around a police squad in New York called Special Victims Unit. SVU mainly handles sex related crimes and crimes related to children. Going on the 13th season, the squad continues to heal and save lives, while putting these offenders away.Elliot Stabler (Christopher Meloni): Elliot comes off as a typical detective who is family man. However, the further you get into the show, the more you learn about his true feelings. Elliot has a wife and five kids (Maureen, Kathleen, Dicky, Elizabeth, and Eli). During the middle of the show series, Elliot experiences issues with balancing his time consuming job with his family, and is forced to make some difficult decisions. Elliot also has anger management problems. He gets in trouble with his supervisors many times for his anger and has been required to see counselors throughout the show. Regardless, he still exhibits a gift and goal of saving civilians. Elliot has been in every season, except this current 13th season. Even though the show is still great, I feel that it may have lost somewhat of the connection with the audience. Elliot was a character that many people favored and could relate to. Olivia Benson (Mariska Hargitay): Olivia is a main character and has been on the show since season one. She was Elliot's partner. Olivia is a product of her own mother's rape, giving her a more personal connection with the job. With that, throughout the show Olivia is seen dealing with knowing the kind of person her dad is and how she knows that she can help stop others, like her father, from attacking other people. For most of the show, Olivia is the one of the only female detectives and is usually better with talking to female victims. Instead of pushing her life towards getting married and having a family, Olivia is completely focused and dedicated to her job as a detective.John Munch (Richard Belzer): Munch is the most opinionated character on the show. He is an older man who has been divorced 4 times and has given up on finding love. He is Jewish, but is not close with his family. Much does not bring up his family too much, but within certain episodes you learn the truth about his relationship with his father. He has more secrets than the rest of the characters, but is able to place any conflicts aside when needed to. Fin Tutuola (Ice-T): Fin is newer than the originals, but has been on the show for many years. Fin did not grow up in a good part of the city, therefore, his knowledge on certain aspects of those parts of the city help with many cases. He is divorced, because of the time he spent undercover on a previous job. Fin's previous job had kept him away from his family enough to have them leave. Throughout the show, you see Fin run into certain occasions with his son who is in college. His son resents him but is responsible to help out if questions or advice is needed in a case (usually involving college situations). Fin does not talk about his love life at work, therefore, you usually won't hear anything about Fin's current dating status. Fin had trouble adjusting to the squad at first and often got into conflicts with Elliot, but later in the series they begin to get along. Fin shows a different side to the squad, from his knowledge and experiences in the city. Don Cragen (Dann Florek): Cragen is Special Victims unit supervisor. The characters usually just refer to him as Cragen or Captain. He is almost like the 'dad' of the squad. He is a recovering alcoholic, who deals with the grief of his wife's death years before. But the captain uses these experiences to give advice and help his detectives. The captain often will bend over backwards to protect, or cover, his detectives when they have made a mistake. He does this because he know he has a good squad and has good faith in each of them.Nick Amaro & Amanda Rollins (Danny Pino & Kelli Giddish): Both of these characters are new to the show, therefore, I have not made a full opinion on either of them yet. Also, I have not gotten too much time to get to know either of them well. I am an Elliot Stabler fan, so the fact that he left the show and now they are on it bothers me. From the recent episodes I have seen, it does not seem like the actors are affecting the show in the way I predicted. With Much, Olivia, and Fin still there, the new actor and actress will soon enough become part of the family. This show is unpredictable. Each episode has a completely new story behind it, with these detectives working and solving the cases. One of my favorite parts about the show is the fact that you have no idea what is coming. One episode could end exactly how you predicted it to, another the complete opposite, or it can end unanswered and let you decide for yourself. After five years of watching this show and successfully seeing every episode, it is safe to say that this show is my addiction. That being said, I highly suggest this show to any individual that likes mystery and suspense, along with following the stories of these characters listed above."
229,"I really love this show and I am totally addicted to it. I own seasons 1 & 2 on DVD and I know they have released season 5. But... Now don't interpret this the wrong way...I do love this series, but why would they release season 5 next but not seasons 3 & 4. This really makes no sense. I have been trying to re-watch the episodes on DVD but now I'm stuck at the end of the 2nd season. Why would I or anyone else of a sane nature want to watch a series out of order. I refuse to buy season 5 until 3 and 4 come out. I've been waiting for years for them to release 3 & 4 to fill the void between 2 and 5. Does anyone else feel my pain? Does anyone know where else I can write to plead for the releases of these missing seasons? Help..."
230,this is a great show i first saw this when i was 12 and I'm hooked i cant miss an episode the show is like a drug without the side affects wish i could meet the cast especially Chris maloni and ice T sine ice T is like my idol. this show tells the truth about the streets of NY. if only the real streets of NY had as good cops. if they made a law and order movie i would be the first to get tickets. law ant order the original and law and order criminal intent are not near as good and trust me i would know. any one who disses LAw and Order SVU near me will get a piece of my law and order special victims obsessed mind. law and order is a big part of my life since i wanna be a detective in the future i am already going to law school.
231,"SVU is the best out of all the Law & Orders (although I love all of them). Its probably one of the best shows on tv.  Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni are great.  Belzer and Ice-T are very entertaining.  March, along with the supporting roles, are good too. The story lines are great, and the acting is excellent....what a perfect show!"
232,i think munch is great on this show. everyone has their own way of handling the crime. they are not always looking at the same angel . thats why the show is so great. everyone has a different personality. munch is the one with the little bit of sarcasm. sometimes it lightens up the dark side of some of the crimes.
233,"I believe that this Law & Order has the best, most intriguing plots. (LO:CI for the best actors) I am fascinated by what one human will do to another, and why, and this show gives us the 'nitty-gritty' of what people in the world (even here in the USA) are doing to each other.  This show also gives us insight into why, possibly, these people do the horrible things they do. I know that these episodes are fiction but when I, daily, read in the paper, or hear on the news about the things people do I wonder 'Why?'.  These episodes give you a hint into understanding a bit better. 
B.D. Wong is superb as the staff psychiatrist (rather a switch from the Priest of OZ!).  He portrays a doctor who, even though he has been trained to analyze and he has been trained to understand how the human mind works, he sometimes still has to shake his head in incredulity at the acts of the criminals.  Very believable character. The other character that I was really surprised by is that of Det. Tutuola played by none other than Ice-T (wasn't he a rapper??). I had seen him in New Jack City and had been shocked at his acting ability in that movie. Apparently he's been acting steadily since then but I've managed to miss him until LO:SVU.  Det. Tutuola is a street-wise detective that uses his knowledge and understanding of how the street works to aid in apprehending the proper criminals. Try it. I bet you'll find you are surprised by how much you like it!"
234,"Law and Order is one of my favorite television shows, and I must admit that I can't wait to see the series premier of Special Victims Unit, especially since I've heard that Det. Munch will be in a regular role (not sure if this is confirmed?). My only qualm about this new outbranching is that it might detract from the time spent on the original show. Overall, though, it seems to have the elements to hopefully make it through a first season."
235,"The wonderful assortment of guest stars. Hot topic story lines. The great chemistry between the actors. This is one of the few series I can watch every single marathon and not get bored. I personally started watching this show when it first started with my grandma, who has now since passed. I don't think I'll ever be able to find another series that has been this great."
236,"I live in Mexico can somebody tell
me which channel has all the seasons ?
so i can rent them?"
237,"I've watch every episode, storylines are always fresh.
The only thing I don't like is that Stabler isn't on anymore. Was hoping he'd cameo roles."
238,"This was to be lead by Chris Meloni, but then it became determined that only 'she' could take care of kids, victims and all. Has it NOT escaped your attention that everyone of talent has jumped ship?! Ice T was a 2nd year and I cannot figure why he sticks around---unless it's the ONLY damn job he can get. And Maria Bello was part of the new cast, but she even hopped the ship. She's doing a great job on NCIS.
It's NOT fun to have that broad be the whole show. And they need to strip the show. It's old and tired. Dick Wolf 's 'Chicago ' shows are fabulous and there is no more need for L&O. Cancel this piece of drek!!"
239,"I love this show, second to the original, but they are showing reruns now, and the later ones, after Benson becomes a sergeant, center more on the lives of the detectives than actual cases -- or the cases involve the detectives. I'm not interested in these episodes, and there are too many of them."
240,"The dialogue for this show is well-written and engaging, and I especially like the character of Barba. Many episodes lack the intensity of shows such as Criminal Minds or Hannibal--in the episodes I've seen on Netflix (which, to be fair, only has four seasons), the victims are usually alive and the killers are usually in custody, which means bringing about justice a little less urgent. Most of the villains are normal people who are simply driven by lust, so we don't get to experience the fractured worldviews of other villains from shows such as Gotham, Hannibal, or Criminal Minds. Still, there is a little bit of crazy mixed in there, even if it's not as much as I like. Overall, I get why so many people adore this show."
241,"I absolutely love this TV show. It hasn't changed a lot over the years, which is hard to do when a show has been going for over seventeen years. I love everything about it. Some people say the cases are the same every week, which some are, but most of them have a twist, that make them completely different from everything else. My favorite seasons are probably Season 5 - 10, I don't know why. I liked it better when Stabler was still in it, but he's gone, and everyone else seems to be disappearing as well. But my favorite character is definitely Finn Tutuola, played by Ice T.This show follows a group of detectives in New York City, who work for the Special Victims Unit. This means the crimes they work on are related to a special victim. Most of the cases are about rape, abuse, prostitutes, and pedophiles. Throughout the years, detectives have come, and gone, except for Olivia Benson, she's the only detective who has been there since the beginning.Recommended for: People who like Law & Order, CSI, and even Boston Legal.Overall, I give this TV show a 9 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Amazing."
242,"This is one of the best TV shows of our time. Real life situations written by real life criminal justice personal. This series is so realistic that it even mirrors the real police procedures out of the NYC Patrol Guide. I applaud NBC for their commitment to keeping this series on the air and for producing one of the best series since Hill Street Blues was on the air. Except this series deals with real life cops personal issues and real life criminal issues and real life issues concerning bad cops. Great show. Thank you for producing the best show and giving us good TV. I hope that NBC commits to this show for more seasons because there is so much more to produce, even with recent events."
243,"I felt like writing this essentially in response to the following comment: 'Best one in the L&O Franchise', posted 18 November 2004 by ""canadianfreak_17"" from Guelph, Canada.Of course, that's because I strongly disagree with 'L&O-Special Vctims Unit' being the best L&O 'edition': Vincent d'Onofrio (AND of course the brilliant writing behind most of the episodes!) gives the show an unmistakable, unique quality. I think he sometimes overdoes his psychoanalytical, manipulative stunt, creating a caricature of the character he plays so well the rest of the time. Maybe, also, his partner Kathryn Erbe as Det. Alexandra Ames is sometimes too much reduced to her supporting act, not being given any opportunity to stand out - even if only once in a while. D'Onofrio truly takes a lot of space, it's ""his show"", and the writers must have been drawn to give him more and more importance. Speaking of which, I'd really like to see some of the first season, to see if she was more his equal than in the later ones I believe I know (maybe it was that way from the very start on...).Still, with the excellent other characters outstandingly cast (Jamey Sheridan and Courtney B. Vance), it's a solid and well crafted show. I'm always quite curious about the twist(s) and the way d'Onofrio is going to squeeze the truth out of the perpetrators (more often than not, we have a 'Colombo'-like quality in the show, knowing who's guilty and the story being how the investigation will nail him!)"
244,i didn't watch this show in the beginning but then i saw one episode on and i got hooked. i have watched every episode that has been on and i think that more channels should have this show on. my favorite actress on this show is Diane Neal she is beautiful and a very good actress she makes a awesome attorney!! the relationship between Elliot Stabler (Chris Meloni) and Olivia Benson(Mariska Hargitay) is very well written and thought through!! i like that its not very personal but not to business they have written there relationship just as lead detectives should be. Another thing i like about the show is John Munch (Richard Belzer) he is the perfect addition to the show he gives a good sense of humor to the show which is always needed for a winning show!! thats what this show is its winning and I'm addicted to it. Its the best law and order franchise!!!
245,"The episodes with Stephanie March as ADA Alex Cabot are the best, Diane Neal pales in comparison. This is a great show (the original comes in a close second).The chemistry between the cast members is great and really drives the show. The detectives Stabler and Benson may be a little too self-righteous and over zealous (okay a lot) but they are kept in line by the chief and counselor Cabot. And Cabot is great, getting held in contempt a lot and with her cool and composed demeanor she is by far the best part of the show. Her send off was amazing but too bad she left the show, because Diane Neal is annoying to no end."
246,"In the past five years, the quality of SVU has improved steadily.  The main cast is outstanding, as is the writing.  Chris Meloni consistently delivers solid performances and Mariska Hargitay is captivating as tough, empathetic Detective Benson.  Like any other TV show, it has its ups and downs, but the ups far outnumber the downs with episodes like ""Guilt,"" ""Loss,"" and ""Abomination.""  Sometimes the Mothership seems overly clinical as it takes viewers through the Issue of the Week, but SVU rarely fails to hit home emotionally.A lot of people call SVU the ""redheaded stepchild"" of the L&O franchise, but it is on par with, if not beyond, the level of its predecessor."
247,"I am watching this show as I am typing this and would like to tell you that it is just as amazing as the original Law & Order series. Although it is dark in storyline, there are some very humourous moments. Chris Meloni and Dean Winters from HBO's ""OZ"" series play Detectives Elliot Stabler and Brian Cassidy. Richard Belzer from the NBC's critically acclaimed and now cancelled ""Homocide: Life On The Street"" reprises his role as Detective John Munch, and Dan Florek reprises his role as Donald Kragen (the role he played in the original Law & Order series). This show is a terrific and compelling show and I hope it remains on television for a long time to come."
248,I love this show I have watch it since the beginning. I love the characters. The only part that I don't like is that the endings are all the same. very sad and terrible. Sometimes it would be nice to have a good ending like other shows. not all the time but some times.
249,"The main reason I started watching this show was Chris Meloni *who plays Chris Keller on my favorite tv show OZ* but i fell in love with SVU instantly. It's really an amazing show with very compelling stories. The acting is awesome : Meloni, Hargitay, Belzer! and Florek do an amazing job. Ice T and Stephanie March are ok *I gotta admit it was a shame to let go of great talents like Dean Winters and Michelle Hurd though*. I now tape every ep of this show which is, in my opinion, way better than the original L&O and L&O:CI."
250,"""Law And Order"" is one of the best shows on T.V. How is its spinoff, ""Law and Order: Special Victims Unit?"" Just as good and sometimes better. L&O S.V.U. has some of the best acting and stories on T.V.
     When it comes to the actors Stephanie March is amazing each week as D.A. Alex Cabot. One of her best episodes involved a murder suspect that fled to Canada. Another of her great episodes involved one child who killed another. The conviction she brings to her role is riveting. She should eventually be nominated for an ""Emmy."" She is one of the main reasons to watch the show.       She is not the only good cast member, SVU is a showcase for many actors. Mariska Hargitay and Christopher Meloni make great partners. They are both very good actors. Ice-T and Richard Belzer are also very good in their roles, Belzer especially. His character is very similar to Jerry Orbach's Detective Briscoe on ""Law and Order"", both are Wise-cracking characters who bring some humor to their respective shows.
     Other members of the cast are Dann Florek, who is very good, and J.K. Simmons as a police psychiatrist. I prefer Carolyn McCormack though. She is a great actress, and extremely convincing as a psychiatrist. Michele Hurd was very good when she played a detective on the show.
     Even though the regular cast members are very good, the guest actors are sometimes extraordinary. Christine Andreas was remarkable as singer Ricki Austin. Tracey Pollan was heart-wrenching as a rape victim. I wish the writers would bring her back more often. Jenna Lamia was masterful as a scheming North Carolina grifter. On the same episode Derek Cecil was very good as one of her victims. Other great special guest stars have included Richard Thomas, Karen Allen, Margot Kidder and others.
     L&O: SVU is a great show that should not be missed."
251,"This program seems to challenge the original with increasingly lurid plots, and that's just fine; boring cases don't bring headlines or Nielsen rating points. This program isn't afraid of controversial issues, always pushing the envelope and challenging viewers to face some very ugly realities. The fact that the police have feelings about what they see in the line of duty is totally appropriate and probably makes them better cops. Whether it's Stabler losing his temper at a particularly disgusting perp or Benson being flooded with compassion for a victim, we believe every word of their performances.The ""Order"" aspect of this show is finally working; Diane Neal's ADA gets it right, sharing the moral outrage of Jack McCoy at what comes through their dockets. All the actors are excellent, including Ice-T who plays very well off Richard Belzer. They are something beyond the cop-movie cliché of mismatched partners.Finally, as a native New Yorker I commend the producers of this program for casting authentic New York types and making these programs feel real and three-dimensional."
252,"I've watched this show for YEARS! I love it. If you've never seen it, you're missing out."
253,"Law and Order SVU continues to amaze. I was a fan of the earlier seasons but it wasn't until Stablers last 5 or so seasons when I became a massive fan. Then when the sad news came where Christopher Meloni decided he had enough I was honestly worried. HOWEVER the additions of Kelli Giddish and Danny Pino have been a great success and Im still enjoying every single minute of it. Every episode seems to be one where at some stage of it you are on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen and with some episodes having a slightly sudden endings you see yourself yelling at the screen for more. I cannot wait until season 16 comes on to the screen. Its one of those shows where even if you know whats going to happen because you've seen it before you still want to watch it again. I must get the box set when it finally comes to an endSVU is by far the best our of all the Law and Orders,"
254,"This review doesn't contain spoilers as such but it does outline the basics of the show.I'm a subtitler by profession and I have subtitled around 70 episodes of this show. They were all from season 11 onwards, so I can't say anything about the show's earlier episodes.Special Victims Unit is another procedural crime show about the police solving cases. Here they focus on ""special victims"", which usually means victims of rape or cases involving children in one way or another. The show is not much different than the five million other shows like it, but it nevertheless does what it does well. If you like shows like this, then this is definitely for you. If not, then don't bother. If you like having details about the police officers' personal lives then this show might not have enough of that. Then the show called The Closer might be a bit better. Nevertheless, I feel there's enough details about the characters to get under their skin but not so much that it becomes tedious.Unlike many other shows, Special Victims Unit delivers what it promises. It doesn't promise any ongoing plot line, so therefore there are no disappointments with regards to this. It only promises to be a show about solving cases. This is, however, also one of the bad things about the show. With no ongoing plot line it doesn't matter if you watch an episode from season 3, 7 or 13. If the show is not evolving why watch it? I suppose you could say the same about The Simpsons or South Park. There's not much to think about after an episode ends either. As the show is about crime it, of course, also conveys that the world is full of evil and that men are scumbags, which is not an admirable ideology (but to be fair, there have also been episodes about women who falsely accuse men of rape, and women who sexually abuse young boys). So, only watch Special Victims Unit for thrilling entertainment. Sometimes you watch a TV show or a film with a very intricate plot, but in the end it becomes so complicated and silly that it loses credibility. Special Victims Unit still manages to be credible despite complicated plot lines, simply because it is so well scripted. I want to be a novelist, and I must say that I admire how well-scripted this show is. At times I have been thinking ""how did they find that evidence?"", or ""why would this person admit this?"", but overall there are very few plot holes, and my hat goes off to a team of writers that time after time can write something like this.The show called Prime Suspect was very similar to Special Victims Unit but nevertheless inferior for two very simple reasons: Prime Suspect was too predictable and not very credible. Special Victims Unit is of course predictable too 'cause they always catch the criminals (in only around two or three episodes out of those 70 episodes I've subtitled has the criminal not been convicted), but Prime Suspect was simply too formulaic: Either the culprit was their first suspect, who after some investigation didn't look guilty but then was after all, or it was someone completely random that they found after investigating a lot of leads. The criminals always confess in that show, and not a single episode ended up in court. This of course also happens in Special Victims Unit but not at the same rate as in Prime Suspect where it was in every episode. In Special Victims Unit there are criminals who have been traumatised, criminals who are mentally ill, criminals who are psychos, criminals who are misogynists, people who made a mistake and then tried to cover it up, etc. There's actually also a surprisingly high amount of corrupt cops who commit crimes in this show. Sometimes the first suspect is the culprit. Other times it's their 14th suspect. Sometimes an episode starts with a minor crime and then leads to a whole network of other crimes far from where the episode started. Some episodes end with a confession in the police station, others end in the court room. Others again end with the criminal being caught in the act. Despite being a formulaic show, Special Victims Unit covers a surprisingly wide field. Prime Suspect was also not very credible because the culprits often confessed just because the cops pressured them a tiny bit – probably because the writers couldn't come up with something. In Special Victims Unit there is at least a lot more persuasion being done before a confession is being made – and usually it seems perfectly likely that the culprit would confess under those circumstances.There have been episodes with sentimental endings where I, maybe because I'm European, have thought ""Yaaaih, America"", but these types of endings are fortunately not so common in this show. In for instance the Canadian ""Flashpoint"", every single episode ended with slow motion images, sentimental pop music and an all too clear message. Luckily, with Special Victims Unit I usually think ""I'm glad they caught that scumbag"", or ""I'm glad this person was acquitted"" at the end of each episode.The last episode of season 13, ""Rhodium Nights"" leads into the first two episodes of season 14, ""Lost reputation"" and ""Above suspicion"". These three episodes are probably the best episodes I've seen of this show. My other favourite episodes: srs 14, ep. 10 (Ep. 282) ""Spiraling down"" (with Treat Williams as a guest star); srs 13, ep. 10 (ep. 283) ""Theatre tricks""; srs 13, ep. 18 (ep. 290) ""Valentine's day"" (with Chloe Sevigny); srs 14, ep. 13 (ep. 308) ""Monster's Legacy (with Mike Tyson)""; and srs 14, ep. 16 (ep. 311) ""Funny Valentine""."
255,"""Law & Order: Special Victim's Unit"" accomplishes a particularly harrowing feat in under fifty minutes, and has been doing so over the course of it's nearly two hundred episodes. The show takes viewers deep within the underbelly of society, and presents storyline after storyline of highly dark and uncomfortably disturbing subject matter as the elite detectives of the Special Victim's Unit investigate one sex crime after another. Somehow the show remains exceedingly entertaining, whether due to the sharp, to-the-point writing, or the stoic, matter-of-fact performances by the talented cast, or maybe there's something more. Perhaps in whatever truth that surely lies in the story lines, there's a glimmer of hope that justice for malicious criminals can also be had in reality. Whatever the case, ""Law & Order: Special Victim's Unit"" is a consistent, if at times formulaic, adult drama."
256,"This is my absolute favorite show ever! I own seasons 2 and 5 on DVD, and the episodes never get old. Mariska Hargitay does an excellent job as detective Olivia Benson, and she definitely deserves the Emmy she won this year! This show is most appropriate for older teens and adults, definitely not appropriate for little children. Contains some explicit details about rape, murder, etc, so children should not watch. If you like shows like CSI, 24, or any drama show, this show may be of interest to you! Detective Olivia Benson is currently on maternity leave and will be replaced by another detective. (Season 8). I hope this show continues to air for as long as possible! Most of the episodes are only one case per show, so even if you miss an episode or two you can still follow the show (unlike some other shows out there)."
257,"I have been in and around law enforcement for over 30 years. Handled everything from barking dogs to homicides. Your folks are good at what they do. I love the character played by Mr. Ice T. I remember when he started his music about shooting cops and how crooked they were. I love the fact that he is now LIVING the job. He sees what we go through. He is a cop I would love to work with. He is honest, tough, tender with kids and victims, courageous and true to his word. That was my credo for 30 years. I didn't get rich like some cops. I just did my job. I did it honestly and from the heart. I coached a bunch of sports teams for kids and loved my wife and daughter. I find a great deal of solace in your episodes. The thought process is all the same, whether TV or for real. You have captured that quite well. Ice T, Munch, Elliot and that gorgeous lady, ( she is a stone fox, just like her mother Jane Mansfiled)he works with. You will have to forgive me, I have spent some big time in the hospital lately and my memory is lacking. Your cast is gold. They are great! Story lines are solid and based in fact not bullshit. Thank you. Thank you for a job well done. I remember this all started with Hill Street Blues, then Life on the Street, Then Law & Order. VERY GOOD SHOWS! But you guys have weathered the storms and triumph over all. Thank you for giving an old cop something worth watching. Oh yeah, I'll be glad to kick anybodies ass who dissagrees with me! I can do 24 in a lock up for simple assault! IT'll be fun to put some pansy ass in the hospital to prove my point. God Bless folks! May you live as long as you want and never want as long as you live! That's an old Irish blessing. Sincerely,Brien Richards 928-279-2441 brich@npgcable.com"
258,"anybody that is a fan of dramatic television has to acknowledge law and order as a whole as being the most dominant franchise of all time...the svu cast is totally related to the hbo oz show and the excellence of production as well...i am not one to buy in to cookie cutter art in any form but i am addicted to law and order in all of it's glory...every version of this series has been outstanding...to me, svu is the crown jewel of network television...stabler, benson and the rest of this crew, are by far the most interesting and eclectic group of actors/detectives ever...from the opening clues, to the closing (or lack there of) resolutions, this show probes deep into the world that we live in and questions everything...in the words of neil young and steven stills...""long may you run"""

260,"Law and order SVU is by far my favourite show! Christopher Meloni perfectly portrays an average father. Since he works with pedophiles and perverts on a daily basis, it's expected that he'll be over-protective of his own kids. The thing that bugs me about his character, however, is that he has a bad temper. I don't see how they (the SVU squad) would let a fowl-tempered detective in their league. But I'm glad they did! Mariska Hargitay, Ice-T, and Richard Belzer are excellent at 'fitting into' their character's personality. Not to mention Dann Florek, in which I'm surprised after seeing him play a funny-guy on the sitcom 'Smart Guy' fit so well into his dramatic character. B.D Wong (Handsome!!) is the perfect Psych. and tough-gal Diane Neal is the perfect Assistant D.A.."
261,"I have been watching Law and Order for many years. It's always been one of my favorite shows. My favorite of the bunch is 'Special Victims Unit'. I like the story lines better and the characters have more passion, more heart. Chris Meloni is my favorite because he is a devoted family man and he is good to women. He watches out for his partner, Benson, and I think he's just an all around good guy. The thing about the original Law and Order I didn't like was all the wise cracks Brisco made. It was a constant thing with that guy! He wasn't much of anything. I still watch it though. I tape all the episodes on my Tivo. I am not a big fan of 'Criminal Intent'. I absolutely adore Vincent D'Onofrio, but this show doesn't do it for me. I wish he had been cast on 'SVU'. That would've been awesome! He is such a wonderful, versatile actor. I loved him in 'The Velocity Of Gary' and 'The Cell'. Anyway, I love Law and Order. It rocks!"
262,"SVU is one of the best shows I've ever seen. It's a great show, with great actors. The storys are gripping, each one keeping you hooked, cliffhanging you at every commerical. I actualy like SVU better than the other two ""Law & Order"" series."
263,"Within the New York Police Department exists a special unit of officers who are dedicated to crimes that have a sexual nature  the Special Victims Unit.  The team of officers, headed by Detectives Elliot Stabler and Olivia Benson, assist or lead where it was felt that the crime had something to do with sexual motivation.I have never watched Law & Order as a series, I have only ever dipped into it when it did a cross over with Homicide Life on the Street.  However I decided to watch SVU as it had quiet a few actors in it that I admired in other things  namely Homicide and Oz.  I watch the first half of the first series and, through me trying to have a life, missed a few here and there. One thing I noticed was that it didn't matter if I missed any or not, because each episode was a contained product  there didn't really seem to be any narrative strands that existed across episodes.  I suspect this is due to the nature of the crimes  generally the sex crimes are spur of the moment things and don't lend themselves to conspiracy etc.  This does cause the series to feel like a collection of episodes rather than a single story spread over episodes.The character development didn't really grab me either.  I loved Homicide mainly because of the characters  they were not only developed but they were an ensemble cast.  Here the two main characters are almost accepted as they are, while the others have very little screen time and are not really given the chance to be missed.  Meloni does a good job and it is strange seeing him in the role after Oz!  He is capable of so much acting wise so it is good to see him leading a series.  Hargitay is OK but not as strong as Meloni.  Belzer does the only character that he can easily do, but I was disappointed by how very little they had given Winters to work with  at least I still have Oz for him!Overall, I will continue to dip in and out of this series and if it grabs me  who knows?  However for the time being, each episode is good in it's own right but the weaknesses of no narrative flow and a real lack of character development beyond a few basic things, means that this show failed to grab me and make a fan out of me."
264,"On the episode about pedophiles adopting orphans, thanks to Patrick Cassidy for being willing to play the role of one of these monsters.  Maybe it helped save a child or wake up some of the billions of people who deny a horrible truth."
265,"It was suggested to me that one of the best performances on television was being given by Vincent D'Onofrio on Law and Order: Criminal intent. I've always admired D' Onofrio's work, including his Orson Welles in Ed Wood and his turn as the man crushed in the subway accident on Homicide. I particularly liked that one because of his refusal to compromise by making the character likable. He was just a guy who had not planned to die that day and was angry at everybody for the fate that had befallen him. He made the character human so we could all relate to him. Unfortunately, I can't relate to the guy he plays on L&O:CI, an overbearing ham who chews up every scene he's in. I much prefer the other Law and Orders where the actors use more restraint. 	I've watched the original L&O for about 10 years. When I first saw it I thought it was the best show I'd ever seen. it seemed grounded in the reality of it's subject and unlike the cross-sectional shows that tell too many stories at once and do justice to none of them. But I've grown tired of the rigid format of the show.  The original law and order is still a good show but I get tired of it's rigid format where you can guess what will happen next based on the minute hand of the clock. At the top of the hour, some people are having a conversation when they suddenly find a body. Then we jump to the crime scene investigation where the detectives get the low-down and Briscoe, at about 5 after makes a wisecrack. then comes the opening credits. The detectives try to find out as much as they can over the next ten minutes but don't have any real leads. The lieutenant tells them they're full of it and sends them to check out some particular thing with uncovers an apparent motive for the murder. This comes at about 15 after. They grill the guy at the station house and maybe put him through a lineup with a defense attorney yipping at their heals. Then they find out the guy didn't do it and it turns out this story is about something else entirely. They find out what it is and at 25 after they tell it to the assistant DA who tells them they are full of it. But they convince her that they aren't full of it and she tells them to arrest the guy. Then comes everybody's favorite scene at half past, the ""How dare you arrest me! Can't you see I'm doing something important?"" scene. Then we come to everybody's other favorite scene, the arraignment where the other defense attorney tells the judge the prosecution's full of it and the judge tells the defense attorney that he's full of it. Then, at 25 of, the district attorney tells the executive district attorney and the assistant district attorney that they're full of it. The defense attorney concurs and presents the executive assistant DA with a motion to suppress whatever evidence they have for some ridiculous reason except that the judge thinks it's a wonderful reason at 15 of we're back where we started. Now the executive assistant and the assistant DA hatch a plan to bend the rules to get the guy convicted anyway. The only suspense is whether it works. And if it doesn't there's usually some extralegal retribution at the end. It's been a great show and it may go on forever but it is possible to get a little tired of it.	I'm not tired of SVU. This has an open-ended format. It's 90% the police and 10% the lawyers but it's mostly about the victims and the perpetrators and how they got that way. It can get a bit seamy at times but the writing and acting are great. Christopher Meloni and Jayne Mansfield's kid, Mariska Hargitay are passionate but under control as the leads. Dann Florek, who was on the original L&O at the beginning is great as their superior. Stephanie March is better than any of the assistant DA's on the original L&O since Jill Hennessy. And they have Richard Belzer reprising him ""Munch"" character from Homicide. It's always compelling."
266,"Can someone please tell me how can the producers get rid of the first female Afro-Amercian cop ever on Law and Order and give it to an ex-pimp like thug called Ice-T?Michelle Hurd (Det. Monique Jefferies) has beauty, intelligence, and an incredible acting abililty which had so much potential. The only person who tied her place on the show was Mariska Hargitay (Detective Benson). Ice-T does not have that police image as the other detectives. It is a horrible plan for the writers to replace her to boost their ratings with a rapper. She wasn't the problem. The show is gradually picking up ratings but it takes time to catch on. To throw a talented actress like Michelle Hurd is just plain stupid.NBC and USA had better make up for their stupid mistake by placing Michelle on another hit show I will definetly boycott this show."
267,I absolutely love SVU. I honestly don't know why this show doesn't win Emmys each year. Mariska is one of the best actresses there are. Olivia's character personality is flawless. Not currently the best fan of Kat.
268,"Great Series
Great Actor's
Great series
Great plot
Great stuff"
269,I absolutely love this show and have been watching it on and off for the past 10 years. The chemistry between Stabler and Benson is done so well and the individual episodes are just great. Appears to be going downhill in the later seasons but it doesn't stop me from re-watching the early seasons over and over. So good.
270,"SVU is the only Law and Order show I will watch. The characters are believable and the stories are intriguing. I know these are based off of true stories but I'm a firm believer that they need to be told. It actually should make more people aware of the dangers around them and what to do if it were to happen to them. You can definitely use the stories as an educational piece at the end of the day so, not only are they interesting to watch, they can be used to educate."
271,"I, personally, love the show. I love the marathon watching on Saturdays and Sundays. Keep the political comments out of it and keep the political comments to yourselves. It's only t.v.! It's not a real live hashover or do over of what's happened earlier in the day, week, month, or year! I do agree with one thing and that's the fact that there is too much of Det. Benson(as much as I like her, but she needs to back off) and not enough of the others. What happened to Stabler...Christopher Meloni? He needed to be in a few more episodes. What about Danny Pino? Why can't we show Rollins doing some major work?"
272,"Congratulation on the great and very brave, also very sensitive coverage in one of your latest episode, about a child being separated from her mom. ( Gabriella Sos ). This is what is great about American Film making, being able to objectively make a self criticism, rahther than making the discussion of these, a taboo."
273,Such a fantastic show. The only normal cable show I watch. Everyone needs to watch this show. Great acting super entertaining and amazing stories.
