0,"This is a beautifully crafted piece of work from Francis Lee and St√©phane Fontaine that depicts the rather downtrodden existence of 19th century English paleontologist Mary Anning (Kate Winslet) who spends much of her time combing the beach for shells and fossils that she restores and sells in a small shop she shares with her ailing mother (Gemma Jones). The arrival of the enthusiastic Roderick Murchison (James McArdle) and his wife Charlotte (Saoirse Ronan) changes her pretty breadline, dreary, routine as he, initially, pays her to show him how to spot the ammonite but then leaves his poorly wife in her care to recuperate from an as yet undefined malady. The story is essentially about how the two women bond, and about how that bond intensifies and it features two very strong performances from the leads who struggle with their delicately smouldering relationship. Together with Lee, they manage to deliver a sense of their longing in a largely un-passionate - yet not sterile - fashion. The snag is that the film really, really, lacks pace and characterisation. It's not that is needs to be a full-on sex-fest, it's that their dialogue is sparing to the point of frugality. Why do they bond? At times their affinity is hard to fathom; terse even - and there is a maternal affinity that seems to compromise the potency of their chemistry as people who are falling in love. There are a couple touching contributions from Fiona Shaw and Gemma Jones (sort of reprises her role from ""God's Own Country"" (2017)) and there is an explicit swipe at the male-driven scientific community that did it's best to discourage/ignore the obvious skills possessed by Anning, but as a film for the big screen it just lacks depth - we are left to guess/assume way too much and it left me feeling just a bit empty."
1,"The first word that comes to mind when reviewing Ammonite is implicit. The only other review (at the time of writing) laments the lack of explicit sex scenes. There's no need for them; this is an understated love story, not a porn film. The sex scenes are few in number, but shot with delicacy and restraint. In fact, very little of this movie is explicit. An awful lot is left to the imagination of the viewer. Back stories are hinted at, touched briefly upon and only once filled in. Even the ending is left to us to imagine. Implicit, rather than explicit, is the watchword for this movie. The performances of the four female leads are in the same vein. Subtly acted throughout; never overdone. A really beautiful movie."
2,"This is a beautiful minimalist film. People call this movie unpassionate, but they have missed the sublety of what's going on. Every look, every touch, every moment, every sound, and every silence means something. I love this film for what it is. My only caveat is that the girl meets girl but has a husband/boyfriend trope has been beaten like a dead horse. Why can't two women just fall in love without there being a man involved? Other than that, it's a beautiful film. I get it."
3,"It's nice and full of emotions. The story is beautiful and flows beautifully with a very good pace and great characters development. The performances by both Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are so strong and Oscar worthy. The movie has some beautiful deep lines and also full of beautiful loud silence. Cinematography is stunning with many beautiful sceneries. Sets and costumes are nice too. Although the movie is so nice and I truly love, I still could feel that it's not new or original to me."
4,"I enjoyed the film. I didn't enjoy fictionalising a real person. Having a pop at yesterday's moral's and how they still impinge on us today is something that could have been done without hijacking a real person. A real person who deserves her story telling properly. Even the BBC article I read said this film wasn't a gender issue film, it was a class issue film, with many men and women suffering what she suffered. If anything gender was a side issue. The gender issue would have been an issue within it's own class, not across classes. But they want to lose that because it doesn't fit the modern tick box exercise and all us working class thickies wouldn't be capable of putting two things together. In fact the same insult is levelled at us still!Maybe I'm being a little harsh. That said, I really enjoyed it as a film. The pace reflected the situation, the acting was brilliant, Kate Winslet expression was a brick wall, but when she eventually succumbed to smile it was beautiful. The story was gorgeous.My criticism lies with the writer/director for picking Mary Anning name to write fiction against. If you are writing a film about her, actually focus on her life, yes you can embellish, but embellish the truth, not that it would need that."
5,"Ammonite excavates the depths of intense lesbian romance. Strong acting would be an understatement. There are a few twists and turns along the way, some of them even predictable but Winslet's authentic performance as her meticulous, passionate character along with the performance of Ronan, keeps us rapt. The film has a captivating cinematography with stark physical beauty and colour palette of the beaches, sets and constumes. However, despite the plot being quite stretched out, Director doesn't fails to deliver a heartwarming and memorable experience."
6,"Ammonite is one of those rare movies that tells its story with minimal dialogue and an exquisite attention to detail.Every aspect of the complex art of storytelling through film is finely attuned to the weaving of this tale, and Ammonite accomplishes this with a delicate and light touch that allows its world to breathe.We experience the visceral windswept beach that animates the life of Kate Winslet's character, Mary Anning, and breathes life back into Saoirse Ronan's character, Charlotte Murchison.There is a bleakness, it is a cold and hard environment, but Winslet and Ronan make it real and bring warmth with two extraordinary performances marked by keen observation and subtlety.Director Francis Lee has crafted his world with great care using every aspect of the medium to full effect - the result is a work of art, a thoroughly engaging movie, a study of life.9 1/2"
7,"Ferociously slow and meandering, lacking the passion and emotion of its contemporaries and a little too long for what it bestows - which is a rather stale tale of two lost and lonely women, one of which has had their flint removed and couldn't catch light if you dosed her in kerosene and dropped her into the sun. There's always, at least, a little optimism, even in the darkest shadows but seemingly not here. Altogether a little too bland and hopeless, albeit with some talented ladies taking the lead."
8,"Similar to when a meeting could've been an email, this movie could've just been a 10 minute short. I was incredibly bored for most of it. A movie with Saoirse and Kate should never be dull to watch, so the blame falls on writer/director Francis Lee for letting these incredibly dynamic women feel wooden and stuck in molasses throughout this story."
9,"Despite great performances from the lead actors I found the film a bit of a disappointment. If you are looking for a spot of geography, geology or paleontology in this film then forget it. West Dorset's ample scenic charms are largely ignored, the rock scapes are minimal and the fossils become somewhat secondary. Even as a biography the representation is highly spurious and misses key parts of Anning's professional achievements. But if a cold Victorian lesbian love story is more your thing then you may enjoy it a lot more."
10,"This movie isn't for everyone, that much is clear from the mixed reviews. Some people enjoy it, others think it's an absolute bore. I fall into the first category. The movie isn't flawless but I found myself involved and captivated throughout. Personally, for me it was never too slow, but I can understand that people might feel differently. You should prepare yourself for a slow-paced, two hour long dramatic period piece.The acting from everyone in the film is fantastic but of course in particular from the two leading ladies. Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan are absolutely terrific. The chemistry between them felt genuine and well-done to me, which is crucial in a romantic movie.Only two very skilled actors could pull off the type of non-verbal communication that is often present in this move. It's nice that they don't have to share their life stories to each other in front of the camera. Their connection is deeper than basic communication. So much can be said with a glance, smile, and subtle body language. It's refreshing and surprisingly intense. Actions speak louder than words, after all.The soundtrack is lovely and subtle, but gets intense at the exact right moments.The cinematography fits the film perfectly.Finally, I was intrigued by the unique concept of the movie. Ammonites, a love story between two women from very different backgrounds, the struggles of a lower class woman living with her terminally ill mother, the inequality between men and women during that time... and all of that (loosely) based on the life of a real person. Multiple interesting concepts coming together in one movie.If you're hoping for a queer love story between two women that is happy and not a little depressing, you might want to adjust your expectations. This movie can be a bit dreary and sad. I have to admit I'm a bit tired of all the gloomy, unhappy WLW movies that exist, and still longing for a relatively happy queer movie, like a 'Love Simon' for women.All in all, however, I did enjoy it and would probably watch it again in a few years."
11,"Ammonite's title is deceptive, being not just about a fossil, but linking directly to the character of Mary Anning, hard and curled up against the world around her. Years of scouting beaches and digging in the dirt, only to have her work credited to men in London, has left her cold and brittle. The arrival of depressed young woman Charlotte however, soon challenges her countenance.
Filmmaker Francis Lee balances the grit and dirt of Mary's excavations with the high Victorian society Charlotte is from with ease and interesting perspective. The film is about downtrodden individuals, spurned by a number of issues from the period, gaining perspective that they're not as alone as they once thought.
Winslet and Ronan play excellently off each other, with Ronan taking on a role you can imagine a young Winslet would have played. Their performance culminates in one of the most intimate love scenes I've seen onscreen for sometime. Knowing that the two actors were allowed to choreograph this themselves with minimal interference is worthy as well, and shows care taken in crafting the relationship.
Clearly this film hasn't clicked with everyone, and it'd probably be best to leave any pre-conceptions of what a 'lesbian film' should include at the door. But if given a fair chance, 'Ammonite' could breathe new interest into the life of a British historic figure."
12,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""Peanuts"" creator Charles Schulz injected ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown"" (1966) with downtrodden Charlie repeating the line, ""I got a rock"" after each house on the trick or treat trail. It was funny because no one would rather have a rock than candy, right? Well, maybe no one except Mary Anning, the 19th century English fossil collector and paleontologist whose story is at the core of writer-director Francis Lee's (GOD'S OWN COUNTRY, 2017) new film. His latest film has received some backlash due to the fictionalized approach it takes with her personal life.Oscar winner (plus 6 other nominations) Kate Winslet stars as Mary Anning, and we first find with her living a quiet life of near solitude in Lyme Regis, a sea side town in West Dorset, England. Having never received her deserved recognition from the scientific community for her discoveries, Mary cares for her mother (Gemma Jones, who also played Winslet's mother in SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, 1995), an elderly woman burdened with having watched 8 of her 10 children die before her. They eke out a living peddling the stones Mary finds and polishes to tourists. Mary rarely speaks and her face shows the wear and tear of a mostly joyless life.One day, Rodrick Murchison (James McArdle, MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS, 2018) drops into the shop. As a fellow scientist, he is aware of and interested in Mary's work. He condescendingly introduces his wife Charlotte (4 time Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan) as suffering from ""melancholia"". When Charlotte falls ill, Rodrick asks Mary to look after her while he continues his travels. Dr. Lieberson (Alec Secareneau, AMULET, 2020) examines Charlotte and recommends rest and sea air. He also takes notice of Mary, an occurrence to which she pays little mind.The contrast between Charlotte and Mary is not limited to age and class. They aren't particularly fond of each other initially, though Mary slowly nurses her back to health. The two ladies finally connect over a heavy rock half-buried in sea wall sediment. The evolution of their relationship is slow, but thanks to the two outstanding actors, it's quite something to watch. Ms. Winslet is particularly affecting as the woman beaten down by life and reluctant to allow any glimmer of hope. We see this in her interaction with neighbor Elizabeth Philpot (Fiona Shaw), a woman with whom there was a previous bond. The old saying goes, ""opposites attract"", and here the two opposites, Mary and Charlotte, bring out the best in each other.The skilled actors never allow the film to slide into melodrama, and instead offer two occasions where unbridled emotion jump off the screen. A passionate and liberating love scene is the first, and then a later re-connection provides the second. Mostly, Mary forces herself to conceal her rare happiness - we wonder if this is due to her belief it won't last, or if it's because she feels unworthy. Either way, it's quite something to watch Ms. Winslet allows us to sense what's she's experiencing inside.Music from Voker Bertelmann and Dustin O'Halloran never overpowers the moment, and the extremely talented cinematographer Stephane Fontaine works his magic. His previous work includes: JACKIE (2016), ELLE (2016), CAPTAIN FANTASTIC (2016), RUST AND BONE (2012), A PROPHET (2009), all beautifully filmed. Filmmaker Lee's controversial dramatic license with the relationship is apparently done to better explain Mary Anning's life, and it's likely the first film where new acquaintances connect in a deep way thanks to the unearthing of a unique rock. Filming took place in Lyme Regis, the actual town where Mary Anning collected fossils in the 1800's."
13,"First, portrait of a lady on fire and now this! every scene is an another ART"
14,"Fist , this movie is not portrait on lady on fire. There are overlaps - women in love, talented women who gets ignored, but this is also about class, about loneliness and about how women have been cheated of their contribution to science - either by denying them opportunities or not recognizing them when they contribute. The point where story starts, Kate has been a victim on all three.
The movie is slow, messy, raw and definitely not for everyone. A Neon movie - A24 has real competition now
Kate did show the pain of woman in early 19th century, stealing the show but Saoirse did wonderful supporting role."
15,"'Ammonite' is a quiet, contemplative drama that consistently engaging and often affecting. Francis Lee crafts a poetic film that impresses with its poignant storytelling, stunning cinematography, and incredible performances delivered by the titanic talents of Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan at the forefront."
16,"I'm rating this the same as I did The Portrait of a Lady, as they both have extreme similarities to one another. Not to take anything away from either, but with this especially, I've never known a quieter film. Not in terms of the volume but there is a real contrast to the sound of the violence of the crashing waves and the feeling of being out of control, to the then relative peace of a warmer day whilst the characters establish their relationships with one another. There are also segments of isolation & at times the silence is deafening & the camera cuts quite often to scenes of live animals crawling over paintings of nature, which I interpreted as though the two worlds look like they are in sync, but very definitely not in equal measure."
17,"Can somebody please persuade French and Saunders to reunite for a parody of Ammonite??!! It's so outrageously grim, so relentlessly grimy, so stubbornly devoid of dialogue and so laboriously and pretentiously arty that it positively cries out to be sent up stupid by Dawn & Jennifer, much as they did with the similarly grim (but infinitely more interesting) Vera Drake. They could make much of the way Winslet and Ronan hurl themselves into a strenuous lesbian relationship (and some in-yer-face - literally- sex scenes) despite their characters having almost nothing in common and no real chemistry. There's endless trudging up stony, inhospitable beaches and tramping around grey, rain-lashed, incomparably dreary Lyme Regis (which, despite how it's depicted, was at the time the story is set one of the more desirable resort towns in the UK). All the supporting characters arrive as fully-fledged caricatures, as though plucked straight from an amateur dramatic version of something by Dickens. It's a shame really. Just as lesbian themed films have earned a degree of street cred thanks to masterpieces like Carol and Portrait of a Lady On Fire, along comes Ammonite to reinforce the popular view that dykes are certain death to either drama or comedy. While historians and scientists debate whether renowned paleontologist Mary Anning (whose sexuality is completely unknown) should be characterised as a lesbian in Ammonite, the more pressing question is whether she should have been characterised as a deeply dull, socially inept, curmudgeonly shrew. I certainly can't help thinking she deserved better."
18,"I get it - I do - it's just SUCH a dull film. very predictable, although barely anything happens, other than sex, which also happens to be dull. there's very little in the way of dialogue, and not nearly enough interaction to make up for it. best bit is seeing Fiona Shaw basically re-enact her character from Killing Eve. makes me question London film festival's selection process. oh, I forgot - it features lesbians, so of course it had to be the closing film!"
19,"Two women develop an intense and unlikely relationship in a Victorian backdrop. Kate Winslet nails an astonishing character study, profound, melancholic, enigmatic. An intense lesbian romance, sensitive, arrestingly observed and incendiarily erotic. Saiorse Ronan is also remarkable proving to be a courageous and career defying performer. Lee conducts the material with excellence and such skillful storytelling announces a new auteur."
20,"I would like to love this movie. I watched 2 hours of a movie that I forgot already half an hour after the screening. It was so bland. Plot without any freshness, at times I had the impression that I did not know what I was watching it for. The film could be shortened by half an hour and maybe it would keep people from falling asleep at the screening. Ammonite was killed primarily by a very poor selection of actresses. The roles of lesbians should be played by real life lesbians because only lesbians can transfer to the screen what they feel and what they struggle with. Saoirse and Kate are great actresses, but they have failed at all in these roles. The biggest problem is that all of these movies are directed by men, not gay women. This is why Ammonite suffers from the same problems that plague other similar lesbian movies. Lack of understanding of two loving women. I thought the Ammonite movie would be innovative, bold, but it ended up with another average and prude experience"
21,The great chemistry makes the best seconds of this film between Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan. But those seconds are lost in a bad script that doesn't know how to make a believable relationship.
22,"It was about time to have a collaboration of Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan and the chosen material was ideal for them. Its a very slow moving but very beautifully shot romance between two women who are quite different from each other. The film doesnt care for big locations and portrays the women slowly growing friendship in a very intimate way.
Kate Winslet is fantastic. One of her best performances in years. She really nailed the role and while her performance seemed one noted moody at most of the time, she was able to show so much more that lays beneath that emotion with her performance. Really good. Saoirse Ronan was also good but its not one of her greatest performances and I am afraid this won't bring her another Oscar nomination. The character appeared a bit underwritten at times and incredibly subtle. She was cute and did all her best but was too much in the shadow of Winslet. A noteworthy performance by Gemma Jones, who must have the saddest eyes in the world.
The film has a very gorgeous cinematography and a beautiful score. I also really liked the way director Francis Lee let us witness the blooming love between his two protagonists. A good film, often a bit slow but it takes its time for its characters."
23,"Saw this movie at a film festival. I am terribly disappointed with what I saw. I was hoping to see something similar to the movie Blue is The Warmest Color. Ammonite is by no means an equally good lesbian movie. Something that stands out most about this movie is the lack of chemistry between the main characters. I don't feel this infatuation, this love, this lust. The plot is also not very engaging, it is stretched out. The film is very prudish in expression. I'm surprised because the previous film by this director was really bold. There are no bold sex scenes in Ammonite. The only bold nudity in the movie doesn't even come from women. This prudishness shouldn't happen in an LGBT movie. I rate the movie 4/10. The costumes were beautiful."
24,"""What a beautiful and great movie, very good chemistry between Kate Winslet and Saoirse Ronan, this movie is di simple but fascinating, great acting between two of them too, i really enjoyed all the scene, this movie it's two hours and i felt this movie is too fast, i highly recommended"""
