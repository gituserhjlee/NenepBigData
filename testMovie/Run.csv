I think it was one of the most effective ones that i have seen this year.It was defiantly a fun, hour and a half popcorn fun movie but i think it was just that little bit extra too. The filmmaking was above that for me. It just had that little bit of extra care put into it and i think it made all the difference.The acting was really great from both of the leads. I was really impressed with Kiera Allen. This was her debut film and i think this will net her even more roles because she was fantastic.I found the score really great too. It really worked together with the script and filmmaking to really get you into the film. I appreciated it.You should definitely watch this, its really fun, supper quick and well made."
1,"Originally intended for release in theaters this smart, intense thriller was sold to hulu and premiered Friday. The brilliant Sarah Paulson (American Horror Story) stars as the mother of a supposedly sick child that she's spent 17 years taking care of her. The young woman Chloe, played by solid newcomer Kiera Allen begins to suspect her mother may be the one keeping her sick. The movie is intense and edge of your seat filled with clever twists and turns. Although the material is familiar its executed creatively by Aneesh Chaganty of the criminally underseen Searching. This would have been great in theaters but is still damn good at home.****/5
Eric: ****.5/5"
2,"I didn't watch any trailer(s) for this movie before I saw it. So I can't say if the trailers give too much away.I'd say, don't watch the trailer to this movies and you'll be impressed.Performances were great all around and the directing superb. A wonderful thriller that was well thought of.Predictable at times, sure. But still a good film and way to tell the story.Give it a watch. I know I'll see it again sometime."
3,"So as many reviews have stated, there was a certain amount of predictability to the film. I will call BS on people 'knowing everything that would happen' - I doubt they knew it would end how it does.The complaints I saw in the reviews are mostly people unwilling to embrace the suspension of disbelief, and I think that is their loss. Of course there are things in here that are farfetched and inaccurate... short of BBC films, you will find that in pretty much every movie. Just because you happen to understand the medical jargon going on in this one doesn't make it less believable than the film you had no 'real world' knowledge on. I think this is a pet peeve of mine.Common complaints again, talking about how a woman could kidnap a child and make her sick, and nobody would notice. WHHHHHHHHHHHHAT? It's like you folks have never heard of munchausen by proxy. It happens a bit more than you'd like to think. They specifically address how this goes under the radar by her use of veterinarians, the fact that she has changed her primary doctor 12 times in a short period of time, home schooling, etc. Are there holes in the plot here? Yes. But they do try to fill in most of the gaps.Another complaint is why the daughter doesn't really do anything to stop her mother. Sharp objects around, etc. But this is, until a week ago, a mother who she believed loved and took care of her. Stockholm syndrome can kick in as a teenager, after a shorter period of time (i.e. Elizabeth Smart who might have been rescued months before had she been able to speak up). Children who are abused frequently can't retaliate. This aspect is not at all far fetched.Like I said, there were parts of the story that were predictable. You knew from the previews that mom was making her sick. Not far in, after seeing how isolated she made them (and the fact that it was clear she wasn't going to let her daughter leave the house), you assumed something else had transpired (ie the kidnapping). The part at the end where she is slipping mom the pills - I did not see that coming.To the acting, Sarah Paulson was great. She did a great job with the subtle creepiness. When the daughter is looking things up online that first night, they do focus in on Sarah after she gives up (sitting in the kitchen watching her try to google things)... but it would be a lot easier to miss her already sitting there when the daughter comes down the stairs.I think the actress who plays the daughter is still coming into her own, and I definitely don't think this is the best genre for her, but she wasn't bad.While predictable - I enjoyed the movie. It is a more subtle, creepy film. I also think they have a lot of nuanced stuff going on with accessibility that went over a lot of reviewers heads (like where mom's escape is only thwarted because the wing is not accessible).I will say, the part where she ninjas out her window, into her mom's room, back to her room (for the inhaler), was just a little ridiculous. :)"
4,"I love Sara Paulson and she always delivers. Of course, it seems alot like Gyspy & DeeDee story, but it's not exactly the same. It's what also makes the movie that much more thrilling, to know it actually happened and happens more then we think.Either way, it's a very good and a definite must watch, especially during quarantine if you like thrillers! I am sure you will enjoy this movie, it doesn't get boring or leave you feeling as if the ending was missing something."
5,"In this simple, but fun plot, director Aneesh Chaganty maintains a tight narrative, executes some brilliant editing, and draws out from his two female leads nail-biting performances that make this thriller well worth a watch.OBLIGATORY PLOT RECAP: Chloe is a highly-intelligent, capable 17-year-old girl with a slew of physical disabilities and ailments. Regardless, she is looking forward to shrugging off her small-town life and heading to college, that is, if she can escape the control of her manipulative mother whose dark secrets run deeper than Chloe fears.Sarah Paulson has practically made a career out of playing insane characters who simmer behind her eyes, leaving you a bit frightened about when she's going to lash out. And, as usual, Paulson delivers her performance in spades. Watching her character struggle to maintain control when her world begins to crumble is terrifying because you know that whatever bad she's done still isn't the worst she can do.Kiera Allen, who plays the wheelchair-bound Chloe--and who is disabled in real life--makes her feature film debut in ""Run,"" and holds her own against Paulson's veteran-level acting chops. Allen makes you feel every bit of suffering Chloe goes through. She never stops for a second to lament her circumstances, but forges ahead as all good proactive heroines should!It's a shame watching the media parade around ""strong female characters"" like Captain Marvel, Rey Palpatine, and Mulan who are nothing more than Mary Sues in their own stories, when brilliantly written female characters like Chloe are struggling to be noticed. This movie made me think of 2019's ""Crawl,"" starring Kaya Scodelario, who played another wonderfully-written female character whose courage, wit, and proactive approach to conflict was character-driven and not magically bestowed upon them because the plot demanded it.I feel like some critics are being unfairly harsh on this movie. David Fear over at Rolling Stone called it a two-star ""misstep,"" while Jeannette Catsoulis at The New York Times insinuated that it's a bad thing that the movie doesn't rely on flashbacks. Are you kidding me?! My screenwriting professor taught me that flashbacks are the laziest form of storytelling and I agree. They're a cheap way to fill in the blanks, and ""Run"" is far more clever than that in how it unfolds its backstory.""Run"" is a very simple story and will feel predictable to many, but it's got a few nice twists and turns that will still keep you guessing. The performances of the leads are what will grip you the most, especially Allen's-who knew that watching a character try to write a single word with a crayon would make me cheer for them? You can do it, Chloe!"
6,"I thought the movie started off a little slow, but i really enjoyed the way the real action started and i also liked the ending.
All in all, it was a great movie, from the plot to the amazing performances, especially by Sarah Paulson, as usual."
7,"Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen (in her acting debut) provide us with great perfomances, a very special dynamic duo that for that alone is worth watching the movie. Both are the best of the film.
The script, by Aneesh Chaganty (also the director) and Sev Ohanian, is good enough to get to know and develop the two characters, find out what the problem is and reach the climax. It may be a simple story, but it is still excellent.
Finally, what every thriller needs, a good scoring, is achieved in this film thanks to the talented Torin Borrowdale. Without a doubt one of the high points of the film.
It's a light and exciting ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat."
8,"Run is a very good thriller . It has amazing acting from both the actresses . Sarah Paulson was creepy and the girl who played her daughter ( can't remember her name ) was spectacular !! This movie is thrilling and tense but it fails on one major factor . The plot . It's filled with plot holes some minor and some major . That's why you have to put your brain aside for this movie . Nonetheless , it's a great movie"
9,"Sarah Paulson is my favorite, but this film isn't her best. I waited for months for this to come out and I'm left wondering why I was so excited. The trailer gave everything away. You knew the whole story before it even started. There was little to no character development and everything just felt like it was 0-100 with no pacing whatsoever. Also, the makeup department for Sarah's final look-the hell were you guys on when you came up with this? I actually laughed when I saw her.It was an okay movie. One that you'd be pissed if you spent money on. Same old story, same old acting. Also, nobody knows how to act an asthma attack."
10,"I am so used to seeing Sarah Paulson portray the victim, I've never taken any of her dangerous and frightening roles seriously until this one! I was literally terrified of her performance in this movie , but I still cared for her character in a way. Kudos to the young actress who played Chloe in this movie, very well done. I give this 9/10 I found it to be a solid thrilling ride that has some heart to it!"
11,"Apparently you can kidnap babies from hospitals, no problem and you can also remove all the equipment from the heart monitoring machines and set off all the alarms and noone cares.Predictable as hell, too many plot holes, a ridiculous ending and a waste of 90 mins."
12,"I really loved this film for a few reasons, first of course being the stellar acting. I also liked the daughter's character being given such a fierce sense of determination. There were a few plot holes for me, namely that the daughter wouldn't be smart enough to play along with a lunatic to get to a point where she had access to help. That and the ending seemed a bit formulaic for me (although the 'code blue' deal was great). But other than that, I thought the buildup was really excellent. What tension while the whole deal was revealed! A bit over the top but a really fun ride."
13,"This movie had so many plot holes that it felt like a comedy. The mom can just steal a baby from the hospital? She poisons her daughter for years and no doctor ever notices this during her frequent visits? What did she do with the mailman's car? Nobody cared the mailman was missing? Why did the daughter never pick up one of the many sharp or blunt objects around her and hit her mom? The mom leaves all her important documents in a box sitting out and labeled? Why would she tie up her daughter's wheel chair and not her daughter? This is how the whole movie goes. The only redeemable quality of the film was Sarah Paulson's super creepy acting. Also, this story has been done so many times. I would not even waste my time watching this."
14,"This movie was really good with a ""Misery"" feel to it."
15,Run was a well acted thriller that had some very good psychological chills in it that were able to impress me in a sort of a way.Before watching this film i thought i will witness another cliched horror film with psychological drama that i saw a million times before but i was actually surprised by this film in a good way.Actresses give a very good job expecely Sarah Paulson who was very creeepy in some scenes and in end she did a god job.Kiera Allen is a actress that i dont know much about but she also did a good job.Run was a nice surprise for me and i was happy with it
16,"Went into this movie with no expectations , didn't watch the trailer either , the film does seem to be a little slow at first but builds the tension more and more as the film goes on , has a few twists in that I didn't expect , has a good ending also , without giving away any spoilers I recommend you give this film a watch, I was pleased 👍👍"
17,"This movie was mediocre at best. Don't believe the people giving it 8 or 9. The plot has been seen many times, it was super unrealistic, and the ending fell flat. They tried to market it as a horror/thriller but nothing about it is thrilling. It's a drama through and through.
I will say though, the actors did amazing with what they were given. Sarah Paulson was her usual self, good, not award worthy. But Kiera Allen really stole the show. She made the movie (which dragged on for what seemed like 2 hours) watchable. If you enjoyed The Act or have nothing else to watch, give it a go."
18,"If you watched ""The Act"", also on Hulu. viewers will not be surprised by the plot.
Although the endings are completely different, one gets the feeling that you've seen this before. Good acting, bad story."
19,"Run is predictable and not great. The acting is fantastic, while the story is mediocre. The story does a wonderful job of being thrilling, but it mainly doesn't go anywhere. I knew everything that was going to happen even though I didn't know anything. However, There was one scene I enjoyed where Clare says, ""you need me."" The acting was just phenomenal in that specific scene.
Overall, it's a one time watch that you'll probably forget."
20,"This is a new film on Hulu by Aneesh Chaganty (and co-written by Sev Ohanian), following up their cinematic debut Searching (2018) with a thriller involving a mother and her 17-year-old daughter born with several complications (arrhythmia, hemochromatosis, asthma, diabetes, and most impactfully paralysis).I will say that it's possible this movie is better than I liked it, but if so it would be for its directing and acting, and less so about the writing. I felt like there were holes everywhere, and perhaps too much is thrown at us too soon for us to properly care for the characters and their situation. This kind of movie has been done before, without much new added to the table minus the wheelchair aspect. There were a lot of elements set up for what could have provided a stronger ending delivery and punch, but most of those beats were one-note and used up earlier in the film rather than connecting a strong inner-weaving as Searching was able to do.I went in blind, and it's likely better that I did given that the trailer is somewhat revealing. I don't think it had a high enough ceiling in the first place to eclipse any wild lack of expectations I already had. My only expectation was in the hands of the creators, and the most redeeming quality this movie will likely have on audiences is I hope they become aware of Searching and see it at some point... which is what I hope most of you all can take away from this. That was my favorite film of 2018, and Run will fall to the wayside as somewhat compelling yet completely forgettable. The story and pre-built relationship just did not have enough juice once the credits rolled."
21,"I have to say that Run was, if anything, a very well acted movie.
Sarah Paulson plays her part very well and Kiera Allen does a superb job.What lets this movie down is the writing and directing.
As my title states, the story was predictable and I knew what was going on from very early on, and the only thing that kept me watching was the actors. Not to mention quite a few things did not add up.The directing/editing is also a letdown as some scenes are unnecessary and drawn out seemingly there just to get the runtime to 90 minutes.I could recommend this for the acting, however the script fails in my opinion and most will figure out what is going on in about 10-15 minutes."
22,"As has happened several times before, an interview with the director and lead actor on NPR put this movie on my do-list. It was a real treat for an evening watch. As I expected, the story was crisp and engaging, containing just enough exposition to jump start the tense story. The acting was uniformly excellent, and pulled me in exactly as the director intended. There were a few plot holes, but like a car racing down a rough road pavement, the taught pacing causes the viewer fly over those rough spots. As a film in the ""thriller"" catagory, it gets the job done!"
23,"This film was mediocre at best. I don't get the 8 or 9 star reviews. I would've enjoyed the movie, but it was highly predictable. The story has been done so many times. There's nothing fresh or new about this film, it's overdone and it seemed rushed. The movie literally goes fron 0 to 100 within the first 15 mins...and so many plot holes.Otherwise, Sarah Paulson did an amazing job as always. And Kiera Allen seems so familiar, but she did an awesome job especially for her film debut. I just wish Aneesh Chaganty and Sev Ohanian had written a better script in comparison to it's predecessor because (don't lie) we all knew what was going to happen in this movie."
24,"Sarah Paulson should have never tarnished her name with this stinker. It goes from 0-60 in a bad way. And don't even get me started on AAAAALL the botched medical aspects (and on a movie based on medicine, that's a big deal). I honestly don't know how I finished it."
25,"Why bother with this crap. It's like a low rent attempt at a thriller but you already know the ending. The lame attempts at suspense are more annoying than anything. It's a bad lifetime movie to be honest. And I like lifetime movies! It's also overly directed, the music is overwrought and the acting is not great. How can they waste Sarah Paulson! Come on man!!!"
26,"...by which I mean, the writers smoked some really good stuff. While high, they thought up the first half of this film. The next day, tired and muddle-headed, they struggled to regain the magic - gone. Ended up doing a lukewarm retread of a syndrome already covered much better in Sharp Objects & The Act. And while it's cheap-popcorn fun to hate pretty much any recent Arah Paulson character, the thrill feels sick and tawdry afterwards, as in: Need a shower. Here's a challenge, or two: (1) Do not write or discuss a script while not of sound mind, and (2) Write a part for Sarah Paulson that allows her to be likeable or at least relatable. The writers & producers of this one missed the boat on all of the above. Direction is tight, with one of the best tracking sequences I've seen in a while - for that, and the first half of the movie, along with Kiera Allen's performance, it gets a '5'."
27,Started off ok then when it got to the part where Chloe is locked in her bedroom then does a Spiderman across the roof it gets stupid.The ending is awful.I love you mum . . . stupid
28,"Omg - this was so bad, predictable, ridiculous, and boring. You know everything that is going to happen within the 1st 10 minutes. And anything after that you don't really care about. I probably fastfordwarded though at least 30-45 minutes and didn't miss a thing. Don't waste your time."
29,"That was really bad written and don't believe all the 9 and 10 reviews they are all fake made by the cast and crew!
I just don't get what was the whole point, it just sucks so hard that I can't believe this has been done intentionally - surely something went horribly wrong somewhere, there has to be some excuse for the lack of any intelligence."
30,This is just the same thing as the act.Spoilers:And why this kinda story lasts this long. Make sure you commit perfect suicide so these kinda parents don't freaking survive. Very frustrating to watch.
31,"I am amazed by this movie because of good and realistic topic. It reminds me of real life cases like Michael Schumacher, Stephen Hawking, foster families, and evil family relatives. Topic is scary, real, serious, and teaching. It raises our awareness for disabled, sick, injured, imprisoned people. Also movie gets more interesting towards end, as things develop. But actors, locations, number of people and static activities make everything too boring, annoying, negative. I expected more reasonability, confidence, science, investigation. Instead, it is too ignorant, and more looking like a setup or even unreal, except for the topic."
32,"This movie was recommended to me by someone whose preferences are generally similar to my own. And so, with an open mind, I turned on ""Run"". Wow. If it was possible to give zero stars, that would be my rating. However, if ""Run"" was intended to be satire, I'd be much more generous with my stars. This movie was so bad, that I could not turn it off. it held me captive in much the same way that Chloe's crazy mom kept her captive. Plot holes galore. So this young girl lives ""off the grid"" and her crazy mom has free reign to keep her under control? No involvement with doctors, teachers or any social service agency, and yet this young girl is depicted as being seriously disabled. The characters are strictly one dimensional. A few highlights: Chloe wheeling herself into a pharmacy and announcing: ""I'm disabled let me cut in line!"", and then telling the pharmacist that she and her mom are playing a scavenger hunt game which involves identifying a mystery pill , and the pharmacist exclaiming, ""I love games!"" but maintaining her professional ethics by refusing to identify the pill. The pill reference is central to the main plot element. Or, another highlight, Chloe pulls herself out of her window and drags herself around the roof in order to gain access to her mom's bedroom. I thought that scene would go on forever. The hospital ""security"" guys appearing just in time to intercept Chloe's mom who is kidnapping her, (for the second time!) from the hospital. The best thing that I can say about this movie was that I found myself laughing out loud and I am not a ""laughing out loud"" kind of person. In this time of extremely limited entertainment opportunities, a few laughs are not a bad thing."
33,We all should come together to end the Sarah Paulson pandemic.
34,"But there's enough differences to make for an engaging film. Can't really say anything bad about it, you know what your getting into and it delivers with rising tension and suspense."
35,How exactly do I get the tip of a soldering iron red hot??? and many other GINORMOUS plot holes the size of the universe...
36,This movie has so many plotholes it's painful to watch! The plot was obvious from the get go and it doesn't help that Kiera Allen is inept at acting. There were many times I thought I was watching a fish gasping for air when all the time it's simply Kiera Allen subpar version of a human.I would rather watch paint dry than ever see this boring snorefest ever again. Save yourself the time and pain and watch someting that has a soul.
37,I had no expectations but this movie was surprisingly good. I can imagine this story in the real life so definitely worth it!
38,"I'm a big fan of Sarah Paulson's, but this is just not up to any kind of standard. The plot is horribly predictable, the acting is sub-par, the editing is slow and terrible. Kiera Allen is meant to portray a resourceful smart young woman, but she ends up coming across as sniveling idiot for most of the movie."
39,"It was a great movie for Hulu, the 2 main actresses did a phenomenal job, it kept me on the edge of my seat,overall I give it a 9"
40,"If you want any tension, better drop a glass of water on your kitchen floor and I can guarantee you'll get double the thrills than watching this one. If you insist on watching it, you'll see how you'll have to wait till the cows come home to figure out whether you're watching a thriller, a horror or a drama. Unfortunately, none of these come to pass. Simply 'inserting' the lead actress (whoever that is) into a script full of plotholes and all over the place won't cut it. You might just find yourself following my advice, going into the kitchen, filling with water a glass that your mother in law gave you as a present and dropping it on the floor accidentally on purpose. 'Ooops' will be your only reaction.Yeah, not to mention the highly unoriginal story and the embarrassing ending..."
41,"Trying to copy the story of Gypsy Rose and her mother who tormented her, horrible!"
42,"I've just finished Run and it makes my brain trembled. I don't want to miss every seconds because the story is inducing. Sarah conquers as a medical lecturer and she suits thoroughly with this psychological role. I can not predict what the daughter do next because she acts so great. Eventually, the realistic picture of life is scary and inhumane only when the people create them on personal greet."
43,I've seen this all before. There's nothing new plot wise. Predictable to the point of annoying. I almost just fast forwarded just to get to the ending.Giving it 5 stars on the strength of Paulson's performance.
44,"Ludicrous plot, script that seems to have been written by high school kids, extreme overacting.Yet another 2020 movie that reeks of a team of people performing their jobs solely because they want to get paid and not because they want to create something rich in entertainment value.Probably worth watching if you're 13 years old and have never seen a thriller before. Otherwise, avoid."
45,There was a little twist that made it even better. I wasn't expecting it to end the way it did. Seven years later and the mother looked like she was 70 years old lol. It was entertaining.
46,"I went into this knowing nothing about it at all, but I like Sarah Paulson, she's an excellent actress but it is Kiera Allen who steals this movie. When you have a movie that is largely just 2 characters, they had better be good and both are giving it their all. Tense, suspenseful and at times thrilling, this works because Ms. Allen is perfect in her role and largely, using just her face, conveys every emotion to perfection that her character is feeling. It's an amazing performance and the movie is well worth watching. In many ways it reminds me of some old time thrillers, when people actually knew how to direct suspense and keep you on the edge of your seat."
47,"Even though this ain't a bad movie by any means, i cant help but feel a little disappointed. I don't wanna take anything away from the directing nor the acting, cause both are top-notch. The feel and atmosphere of the movie is very thrilling and suspenseful. And i really see a bright future for Aneesh Chaganty, but this is nowhere as good as his debut Searching.The plot is very dull, unoriginal and the timing couldnt be worse. The last, couple years we have seen a numerous movies tackle the illness know as ""Münchausen by Proxy"", where we essentially see a mother poison her child. I feel like i've watched this movie 5 times before.The movie is also very predictable, with might have to due, with my previous fact that we have seen this movie already. Whether or not, you know within the first couple of minutes whats gonna happen, and the very first scene also gives the twist ending away.I feel very disappointed especially because Searching was one of my favorite movies last year. I expected so much, but this movie is rather unambiguous"
48,"This film is exactly what I expected from the trailer and although I did guess what was happening and when, I still really enjoyed it and even found myself clutching for breath at the instense claustrophobic scenes. Both leading actresses were 10/10 for their acting."
49,"Please check the 59:51 and 1:00:21 minutes of the movie .
And you will understand the flaw of the movie"
50,"I will literally watch Anything Sarah Paulson, but I am not biased when it comes to movies Just because someone is in it I enjoyed.ANY Review over 5, HAS to be from PAID promoters.
ANY Review over 7 is bologna.
And Any 9/10 review is Pure Comedy and a pathetic ploy to get streams.movie is alright quick watch. Slow, Slowww in the beginning, frustrating with potholes but in the end, An okay 90 min redo of a story many of us have watched playbout before."
51,"Just watched it, got to vote it. Sarah Paulson was amazing as always. The actress potrayed the daughter, sorry i forgot your name, put so much effort to deliver some wonderful performances which i enjoyed so much."
52,"The Plot of the movie is simple And Engaging . The story revolves around Only Two characters A mother and the Daughter , The Mystery , Suspense and Thrill is so Great & keeps you Hooked to the Movie. One of the Great Mystery thriller Movie of 2020.."
53,"8/10 - with tremendous performances from Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen, this horror-thriller proves Aneesh Chaganty (and the rest of his team responsible for this and 2018's Searching) is a new great of the genre"
54,"I give it a 8 out of 10 because some scenes are left unexplained, but other than that it's a very good edge of your seat movie."
55,This movie is an above average thriller. With excellent screen play.
56,Better than I hoped. Gripping and edge of your seat action throughout the whole film! I wasn't expecting it to capture me as quickly as it did. And it held on to me up to the very end.
57,"Didn't know much about the film before deciding to watch and was very impressed.
Have seen the directors first film Searching and loved that as well.
Both main leads acted very well and it was a shame the film had to end after 1 hour 30 mins.
Looking forward to seeing what the director does next."
58,"Damn, I really appreciate a movie with a plot twist that I don't expect at all. I've seen similar plotlines, for example the show called ""The Act"". But what made this movie so much more enjoyable than The Act was the choice of actors. Sarah Paulson's facial expressions made me feel so creeped out and I am stunned by Kiera's acting. It was a lot more dramatic than the characters on The Act, although the one criticism would be that some of the dialogue could have been better written. I feel like Sarah Paulson can play so many different roles in movies and she did so well in this one. YES! I was actually shaking throughout the entire movie! It was soooo thrilling to watch!"
59,"I was intrigued by the premise of this movie. I was aware of the miniseries ""The Act"" and the documentary that preceded it ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"", the story of Gypsy. An extreme case of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy (MSbP). This film does show the dark side of it, but not well enough. It barely scratches the surface of the disorder however, it does show the manipulation from the provider to the surrounding acquaintances of the family. These being the postman and local pharmacist. This is more like a take on ""Misery"" instead of the story of Gypsy and how she was manipulated by her mother. ""Run"" instead shows how the victim uses her knowledge and skills to single handedly fight and break free from chains of confinement- literally and metaphorically. I think the main problem was the perspective of the script. It's too much like ""Misery"", which was written in the form of delusional toxic fandom. The script just substitutes the line of ""I'm your number one fan"" for ""I'm your mom."" For which in the circumstance of ""Misery"", serves that story really well. Using that same approach with ""Run"" doesn't work. Delusional? Yes. Toxic? Yes. But with MSbP, which this film wants to show, doesn't show the extreme lengths a provider will go in order to stay in that position of power, so to speak. Providers will literally torture their victims, break bones, bind feet, blind, etc. to ensure that they are always needed. In some cases providers will kill their victims to gain additional sympathy from close friends.This movie doesn't show MSbP properly. It's toxic delusional mothering to be sure, but it is not a good example of MSbP. For that watch the documentary ""Mommy Dead and Dearest"" and the HBO show Autopsy Confessions of a medical examiner- the story of Marybeth Tinning. The latter will chill your bones.Spoilers
Where ""Run"" also comes up short is the ending. The prolonged torcher Chloe inflicts makes her no better than her ""mother"" was. I would've preferred a one time retribution- kicking her ""mother"" down the stairs before the police shot her and she fell. Just so we the audience can cheer for Chloe getting her own little revenge and then growing up and having as normal a life as she can. Whereas in the actual ending we see a bland role reversal. Not fitting for the story and source material it comes from. There's more potential in the source instead of what's in this story."
60,"It's Friday night, dark and cold outside and Taco on my plate, let's go! Alright thriller, easy and enjoyable enough. Nothing new and it's pretty predictable, at least for me. My buddy didn't see is as that predictable, but he has seen 1/10 of movies I have seen. Anyways, good acting and good story, even if it has been recycled again. I still enjoyed it a little bit.You pretty much get what you expect. I feel 6.5/10 is fair"
61,Didn't expect much when started to watch Run but to my surprise it was a suspenseful little gem. The acting was great and the story kept me at the edge of my seat at times.
62,"Let's get this out of the way : Sarah Paulson amazing as always. And the movie, kept me on the ege at all times. The pacing is good, not boring at all, not a single minute was wasted. Actually it's a breath of fresh air in the thriller category, not a story like all others.Just do a favor to yourself and watch it. The stars I gave says it all."
63,Sooooooo dumb! A complete and total waste of time.
64,"If we overlooked the senseless fact that the Mother Managed to kidnap a baby from the NICU. The Plot is actually great.This is the director's second long movie after Searching (2018) and he is really talented, however, I was able to figure out a big chunk of the plot a mile away, and the Ending was not that good actually"
65,"It was a great film with a suspenseful story that kept me on the edge of my seat. I highly recommend for all to watch it. So many people are complain about the plot holes but they need to realise that, like Chloe, they shouldn't be complaining. If I found out Sarah Paulson had kidnapped me & then wasn't my mother, I'd be damn grateful for her. RIP Tom the Mailman"
66,"I'm surprised by all the bad reviews on here. I really enjoyed this film! I've seen my fair share of thrillers before, and I usually find them mediocre because they're either too slow, too cheesy, or too predictable. This movie was captivating, engaging, and exciting. There were no moments that felt too slow, and there wasn't a single time where I thought ""when will they move on?"" Sure, this wasn't crazy shocking or mind-blowing, but it's not meant to be. It's just meant to tell a story and tell it well, which it does."
67,"Rapunzel in real life. I was hooked, intense, few couple freaky scenes, Chloe is a great little actress."
68,"This is a drama/mystery/thriller and NOT a horror movie in any way. (Maybe for couples in their late pregnancy days ;) )
For additional info. i.e. numerous plot holes read other reviews.NOT A HORROR MOVIE!"
69,"Aneesh Chaganty's second directorial effort is several notches below his first ('Searching'). All of the mystery and thrills get exhausted in the first 35 minutes and thereafter, it's a straightforward, predictably mediocre film. It's almost like the writers (Changanty himself & Sev Ohanian) ran out of ideas in the second half and what ends up on the screen is plot-holes galore. I mean, I simply cannot like a thriller where the antagonist stocks all evidence of her wrongdoings in a goddamn box for the protagonist to conveniently find them at a crucial juncture in the film. That's just ridiculous!The good thing to have come out of the weirdly titled 'Run' is Kiera Allen. She puts up a more-than-decent performance that keeps the first act and parts of the second mostly engaging. Sarah Paulson is fine as the creepy, protective mom but I wish her character had better detailing (those scars were such a useless decoy!) . The film seems to have been designed to evoke the feels of reading a Stephen King novel (noticed the Kathy Bates Easter egg) or watching one of M.N Shyamalan's earlier thrillers. In fact, some wide-angle shots are effectively chilling. The quest to unravel the mystery is, though predictable, fairly more exciting in the initial bits.On the whole, I felt that Run was a rather hollow effort in creating an emotional thriller that places the subject of abusive parenting at its forefront. It does offer a few big acting moments for Kiera Allen (who's a wheelchair-user in real life) but forgets to flesh out Paulson's character. 'Run' isn't a solid follow-up to 'Searching', but I'll still keep an eye out for Chaganty's next."
70,"Sarah's acting was amazing, and i love the girl! for a hulu original, it was very, very enjoyable!"
71,The acting is very good and the story is interesting as long as you did not saw the gypsy rose story (the real story is much more crazy than this movie...).
72,"Extremely enthralling movie from the outset. Within 20 minutes I was on the edge of my couch, and didn't leave until the end. A tense psychological thriller.At an hour and a half, this is worth everyone's time. I can't stress this enough. It's amazing.Completely realistic plot as well - the people who think it isn't have a nicely insulated view of the messed up things that happen in this world."
73,"If you're into ridiculous, unimaginative, played out story lines, than this is the one for You! I don't know how this got above a 4 star avg... I'm guessing because everyone's on lockdown with nothing else to watch. I'd rather stare at the fuzz on the screen."
74,Much more twisted than I thought.You won't believe what happens. It's actually pretty shocking.Though you may wanna smack Diane Sherman by the end of it.
75,"First of all, you'll witness great performances from Kiera Allen and Sarah Paulson. Both actresses delve into their mother-daughter characters very well. The director wants the viewer to get hooked with the movie's creepy and realistic story. Definitely, the title of this movie literally says it all, RUN!"
76,"This movie is a real good thriller, but the plot-holes bring it down from an 8 or even possibly a 9, down to a 7 unfortunately... I do however really like the acting and the story itself is excellent as well. It's also really refreshing to see them use an disabled actor for a role instead of a non-disabled actor simply acting disabled... it's something that Directors should do much, much more often. I liked the pacing of the film, the suspense, as well as the plot twists (although I managed to predict 2 of the plot twists, so it's not like the film's plot twists are amazing or anything like that). Really the only problem that I have with the film is the plot-holes, but otherwise than that it's a good thriller that's well worth watching once."
77,"I wasn't expecting much getting into it and also i'm not the biggest fan of horror but i was really surprised by this movie it was so intense from the beginning to the end with a pretty good thriller and also 'some' horror elements and gave a whole story in just 1 hour and 25 minutes! and i'm not going to prolong this review i'm just gonna say ""YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT"""
78,"* There is no end credit scene *The director Aneesh Chaganty and crew brought an overfamiliar storyline. The story sets when a homeschooled teenager begins to suspect that her overprotective mother is keeping a secret from her. I wasn't intrigued when I watched the trailer because it was a film that has been done so many times and it feels like he took an idea from every drama movie surrounded by this storyline and added it all into his film. I expected more from him since his directional debut Searching (2018), was fantastic and even though this was a common film I thought maybe there was a twist but sadly it was already done before making it annoying and predictable.The composer Torin Borrowdale knows how to really set the thriller atmosphere. No matter how repetitive the movie was I was impressed by the suspense in certain scenes and the music set it perfectly making me feel very edgy.Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen's performances were fantastic but I couldn't deeply feel for the mother because it lacked depth in the script making me not be able to feel for her situation. By not having her have more depth it created a chain of events of me not be able to feel for the daughter as well. Aside from the needed missing depth in the storyline which is not their fault, both of them were still incredibly gripping especially Kiera Allen."
79,"When I watched this movie I felt it was building up to something. Then the shooting happened and I was like ""is it over?"". Then there was a final scene and I was waiting for a twist, but no. I went here and checked if I missed something, but no.
Really strange movie, maybe it was supposed to be longer and they ran out of money or something. Surely feels like it.Also I wondered why she kept on having problems after she stopped taking the medicine?
Also the baby that died was named Chloe, why did she not change her name before the final scene?"
80,"After I saw the daughter getting into her wheelchair I knew the plot. I've seen real true life stories like this, so not impressed. Overrated, but right now the world doesn't have many movie options right now."
81,"Good acting and production value . Very predictable. Still enjoyed. If you enjoy Lifetime movies then watch it. Recommend ""The Act"" on Hulu. There are some similarities to the show. ""The Act"" is better but this is a quick movie the dramatic Lifetime genre."
82,Good movie but as always with this category of film they always lack sens that would have ended the problem with one cry for help. And how do you even apply for collage when you don't exist?
83,"This was the best psychological horror I have seen in a while. Really keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time! It shares a common theme with Hulu's miniseries ""The Act"", and I think it is just about as well executed for it's hour and a half runtime. I'd definitely say it had to have been heavily influenced by the case of Gypsy Rose Blanchard. Hope that doesn't pass as too much of a spoiler.Sarah Paulson displayed a great performance, as she always does. Learning that this is Kiera Allen's first movie (The actress who plays Chloe) was kind of a shocker. She did an absolutely fantastic job! She is going to go very far with her acting career if thats what she can do!I absolutely LOVED the ending! Won't give it away, but it was perfect in my opinion. Don't skip this one! Definitely a must see, especially for fans of the genre!"
84,Amazing movie ! The best thriller I have seen in a while ! Don't watch the trailer ! Just dive right in !
85,"Is it very original? No. Is it good? Yes.Cinema how it should, good story, tense, beautifully shot (am I the only one who saw a lot of shots paying homage to some other cinema classics?), very well acted, and not even a bit over pretentious."
86,"Among the big budget and big name releases ,Aneesh Chaganty's ('Searching"") Run released in Hulu.Aneesh Chaganty has set his bars high with an amzingly well made film ""Searching""in his debut and so anticipations were high.
If compared with Searching,Run is a disappointment but it's still an engaging watch.The film has hardly anything to add to it's plot if you have watched the trailer but that doesn't take away anything from the tense moments in the film.Chaganty has used silence i.e lack of any music in some parts of the film quite effectively,there were some moments where you couldn't take your eye away from the screen.
Kiera Allen(a real life handicapped girl) has been impressive in her debut and Ms Paulson has been menacing as a creepy woman.The film lacks character buildups and has spend more times in creating moments rather than adding anything new to the story.
Aneesh Chaganty is really a man to watch out for in the future.According to sources,he and his co writer Sev Ohanian are developing a script for the sequel for Searching"
87,"I'm coming at this as a person who is not the greatest fan of thriller movies so hear me out here. This movie is really intense, the acting is really on the mark and makes you feel anxious. I'd say pacing is good as well, with a good transition from normalcy to horroresque. My main problem with this movie is that there are many plot holes that kind of bring you out of the emersion. Things that you just know feel off, or just shouldn't really work. The story is also predictable, and i could usually guess where it was going to go (though there were sometimes that did not follow that, so i will give them credit where it is due). Overall, a decent movie, i'd say that acting saves it. Would recommend for anyone that wants to watch a pretty solid thriller movie, as long as you look past some of its plot holes."
88,Every opportunity to treat the audience like a smooth brain is taken. Unexciting plot twists hold this sorry excuse for story together. The dialogue is clunky and Sarah Paulson adds to her catalogue of horror themed non-horror failures.My best friend said he liked this movie. We are no longer friends.
89,4 out of 5 stars.Run is a good thriller film about a mother Diane (Sarah Paulson) after prematurely giving birth. Her baby is born with several illnesses and disorders that will cause her to always need help and be medicated. As a teen Chloe (Kiera Allen) is homeschooled by her mother. While anxiously waiting to hear back from an university on her application. She soon discover that one of her medication may not be her own. Which causes her to dig up more information if her mother is really helping her or her mother is hiding something.Run is a effective thriller. Putting the audience on the edge with a poor helpless girl. Which she is unable to walk. Her mother sheltering her away with no computer besides her own. No cell phones. So Chloe is unable to really reach for outside help besides her mother. The direction did a good job in leaving you on the edge of your seat. Chloe trying to seek help while her mother is distracted with something. But moments later her mother is creepily lurking near.The plot may be covering similar concept grounds that lifetime movies have done before. But thrilling nonetheless. There is a twist that may shock viewers.Sarah Paulson plays a creepy obsessed mother really well. Kiera Allen also did a good job in playing a struggling daughter.The film does pick up the pace with thrills and suspense which may have you gasping for air when Chloe is trying to seek help away from her mother. Definitely a thriller worth checking out.
90,"No spoilers, but slow and at times, intense.
Worth a stay-at-home viewing.
Great acting."
91,"Although the mystery here is obvious from the first minutes due to this basically being an adaptation of previous productions released quite recently, the movie turned out to be great. Great and irritating, because at every step the protagonist could've done so much more. I guess that is also a talent to agitate a viewer that much and so simply. Also great performance by young actress."
92,"Plot: I found it extremely thriller and psychological! It has quite nothing horror. I also want to say that I'm not so much into psychological movies so I'll just say about my impressions.
At the beginning I didn't really like it and I thought also the acting was a little faltering. But then everything start to be more clear and I started to appreciate it. The story is well narrated, in a way that keeps you on the edge, in suspense.
And the end... I liked it a lot!Actress & Acting: At the beginning I didn't like them so much, in particular the mother, Sarah Paulson.
At the end I liked them a bit more but not so much.Soundtrack: good. This had a horror fingerprint.Conclusion: a good film for everyone who likes thriller and psychological movies.
I repeat that there is no horror, just the soundtrack. Anyway I think is more for adults than 13-years kids. Is more comprehensible and I think that kids can be a little shacked about some psychological things. If they get it, of course."
93,"Very good film, intense thriller, superb acting between both main characters, sarah paulson acting i found was better in this film than ""glass""!"
94,"After 10minutes of watching, I was able to predict how the plot is going to be, who is the bad chraracter, however the course of events was nice, never felt bored, but I felt angry and frustrated in some of the events. I can say there is a bit of nonsense in the plot although it was important for the movie to go on.Overall, I enjoyed the film, Although the girl is disabled, she is combatant and warrior."
95,"Excellent psychological film
The sick overpdetective mother who does everything to keep her daughter with her"
96,"I love this amazing movie when I watch movie I got emotional, it's my personal problem. Whenever I watch this it hold me it's really amazing."
97,I did not expect much . I was pleasantly surprised. Solid thriller. Well worth the watch. Good performances. Plenty of suspense.
98,"A simple concept that works very well. The performances were also solid, and the execution of the script also works. It began a little better and more disturbing than it ended, but it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout."
99,"Run follows the well-throdden path of classic thrillers with the idea of the disabled victim thrown in. I found it exciting and enjoyable enough to deserve 8 stars but it lacks really surprising twists in the story.
The two main characters were played convincingly but my favourite was Kiera Allen. Her face and voice were extremely expressive and I would love to see her in other leading roles in the future.
The only thing I didn't quite like was the ending. I understand that the filmmakers wanted to satisfy the viewers' instinsive desire for revenge but this means that Chloe remains hostage of her ""mom"" instead of starting to live her life at last."
100,"""I... don't... need you.""
""You will.""A homeschooled teenager confined to a wheelchair due to many medical issues begins to suspect her mother is keeping a dark secret from her. This by itself is an interesting enough plot for potential. Then add Aneesh Chaganty and it's bound to be a success. Run is probably more popular than Searching already from the record breaking views on Hulu. All of us Searching fans have been waiting for this one for a while now. I'm sad to say Run doesn't quite hold up to the standards of Searching, but this is still a good movie. Sev Ohanian and Aneesh Chaganty know how to make a compelling story. Every step of the way I wanted to know what would happen next. How Searching filled itself up with mystery and twists till the end overpowers this one. Run's setup is not like that in which you know what is going to happen, but how it will unfold is the mystery. That's where it suffered for me. Just the expectations I had from the writers, directors, and raving reviews before its release had me with such high hopes. In the end I got a good movie, though.The performances is where the story shines most. Sarah Paulson has been the center of attention for this one because of American Horror Story and how well she does with horrors/thrillers. She is convincing, but because of the writing you know what's going to happen with her and everything. For her first feature, Kiera Allen does fantastic. We're with her mainly the whole time so we can really connect with her. Portraying all these health issues can be challenging for an actor. She makes it look almost easy with how well she did. I'm sure come Chainsaw Awards and all those, she'll be in conversation. I don't have much else to say about Run. It's good but didn't wow me. As a thriller, this is very entertaining and a good watch. The reviews might be a little generous but that's not to say this doesn't represent good filmmaking."
101,"Suspenseful, twisted and nerve-rattling; ""Run"" is filled with tons of WTF moments that will keep you guessing until the very end.In this thriller, a homeschooled teenager begins to suspect her mother is keeping a dark secret from her.Lead by a terrifying performance from Sarah Paulson, ""Run"" just goes to show that Paulson can tackle any role given to her. Kiera Allen is respectively terrific and will become a big name. You can tell that this film is heavily inspired by films from the past like ""Mommie Dearest"" and ""Misery"" for example. The 90-minute run time is perfect and the film flows at a fast pace, making ""Run"" a non-stop nail-bitting thriller that will have you howling at the screen.Follow @snobmedia for all reviews!"
102,I thought this movie was a great psychological thriller. Suspenseful and well acted.
103,"From the writer-director of Searching comes another neatly crafted, briskly paced & delightfully atmospheric mystery-thriller that makes fab use of its genre elements to deliver the chills. Run steadily ratchets up the tension & only gets more suspenseful as plot progresses but the story also loses its sure footing in the final act and fails to separate itself from the crowd.Co-written & directed by Aneesh Chaganty, where his feature film debut dazzled us with its originality, unpredictability & edge-of-the-seat content, this sophomore effort only gets bogged down by our own familiarity with the setup. Still, there are several tense & thrilling scenarios in store here and the plot sustains its grip on the viewers for the most part. But the payoff isn't rewarding enough.It doesn't take long for the main plot to surface. It actually does a tad too early when more time should've been devoted to make the mother-daughter bonding feel real & authentic before sowing the seeds of doubts & suspicions in our protagonist. Acting is impressive from both Sarah Paulson & Kiera Allen, for the former is believable as the crazy mom while the latter renders every facet of her character's physicality with precision to steal the show.Overall, Run is a competently constructed example of its genre(s) that manages to keep us invested in the outcome despite the predictable storyline but unfortunately fails to stick the landing when it's time to wrap up the journey. The finale still works, albeit in a formulaic & generic way. Underwhelming when compared to Chaganty's previous feature, Run is far from a disaster and a slight adjustment in expectations should yield a satisfying enough experience for most, if not all."
104,"Run is the newest Hulu original film. It was originally supposed to come out on mothers day but then got moved to November. If I saw this on mothers day, I wouldn't have wanted to spend time with my mother.Run is about a mom named, Diane (Sarah Paulson) who is really protective of her daughter, Chloe (Kiera Allen) because of how sick she is. Her daughter then suspects that her mom is keeping a dark secret from her.Run was a film I wasn't planning on watching because I don't have Hulu and it didn't seem like something to get Hulu for. I still wouldn't get Hulu just for this movie but that doesn't mean its bad. I was at a cabin that had Hulu and I watched this film at the cabin. I was utterly surprised. I thought this film wasn't going to be that good but ended up being something much better. To start, the story was wonderfully crafted. From start to finish it had me on the edge of my seat. The only thing I didn't like about the story was one little bit at the end. I just thought it didn't need to be there at all. Besides that the story was wonderful. It was cool to see how the mother and daughter bonded at the start. It showed that they both actually did care for each other at one point.The acting in the film was probably the best part. Kiera Allen as the disabled girl was a fantastic choice. She needs a wheel chair in real life so it added to the performance a lot. I bet if they got someone else that wasn't in a wheel chair, the part would have been portrayed a lot differently. Sarah Paulson gave a marvelous performance. She always plays such a creepy person in movies. This film wasn't her best but it was a darn good performance. The daughter and mother were really the only two actors in the film besides for some other little parts that some characters had.As I said in the title, this film is actually thrilling. There are a lot of movies that just aren't scary at all that have been coming out. The two films this year that actually freaked me out are Run and His House. His House is a marvelous film I would defiantly recommend checking out. This film was a nail biter though. It had you asking many questions to your self during the movie about character decisions. The main character wasn't dumb or anything but the mom was the one that made you think. There were also some really intense sequences were the main character had to get something done but the mom was pretty close to her. Those always make me freak out a little bit. Overall, the film was incredibly intense.Run put you in the shoes of the main character and got you onto the edge of your seat. I would recommend this film to anybody that likes thrillers or if you have Hulu. It is defiantly one of the best films of the year."
105,Solid horror movie with good acting and ending. Has some plot holes but not many.
106,"Run: Some mothers will do anything to keep control over their daughters. In this case it even extends to giving the daughter animal muscle relaxants to keep her in a wheelchair. This is is more than just another tale of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy though; far darker secrets are revealed as the narrative unfolds. Most of the horror here is psychological but there are some violent scenes. There is also the sense of betrayal as the daughter, Chloe (Kiera Allen), begins to comprehend the enormity of the transgressions inflicted on her by her mother (Sarah Paulson). Good acting by Allen and Paulson in this horror/thriller which is Written and Directed by Aneesh Chaganty. 7/10."
107,"I haven't seen a good movie in a while like a really good one, the whole thing was nerve wracking you just want to know what happens next , the only thing there is no Horror in it."
108,"Two reasons to watch are Sarah Paulson and most especially Kiera Allen. She is a revelation in her first film role. A disabled actress playing a disabled person should not be novel, but happens all too rarely. She makes the peril seem real and urgent. Let's see more of her. Recommended."
109,"From the opening 5 minutes, I guessed the twist of the movie. However, aside from that, the movie did a great job building tension and claustrophobia."
110,"This movie was terrible, awful, disgusting. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I cant believe Sara paulson agreed to be in this, it's worse than tusk"
111,"Well 10 minutes into the film & I have already figured out the twist. This is a film about munchausen by proxy. Sarah Paulson seems to be prominent & in a lot of TV series & movies of late. I do not know if that is a good or bad thing. This cat and mouse game between ""mother"" and daughter is intriguing but very predictable. Sarah does her best impression of Jack Nicholson in the Shining or Kathy Bates in Misery. Imitations are rarely as good as the original and this proves to ring true here.I found it illogical that the mother has readily access to needles & syringes & medication galore prescribed for a fictitious animal without the pharmacist first checking. This can only occur in films. The finale twist is equally baffling... Hospital security is not that easy to by pass... What disappointed me most about this film is that everything that happens can be predicted leaving me with a suspenseful-less film. Ps run/stay away from this film if you know what is good for you!"
112,Perfect thriller. Always on the edge swinging to which side is more plausible with the hints for each increasing constantly.Not a single thing I what want different in that specific movie.
113,I loved it. im excited for new movies from this director! very much thriller and keeps u at the edge if your seat. period.
114,It was actually pretty good. Definitely a thrill. We got stressed. No scares but there are some thrills! Thrilling. You'll enjoy!
115,Of course there is some craziness and predictability here. If you don't know what you're in for after the trailer you're kind of a dope. Reminds me of those really fun/goofy ABC movie thrillers from the 70s. Performances are very good.
116,Everything in this movie is true life crime relatable and could totally happen people who complained about plot holes obviously don't follow true crime Good movie
117,"What a great movie. There is no boring scene. The story is excellent. Kiera and Sarah play their parts perfectly.
You discover new pieces of the story as the story goes on. This movie was really an exciting movie. It keeps you on your toes.
There were few minor scary parts as well. You discover something in the middle of the movie and that will blow your mind. Of course, I won't reveal anything. But the ''secret'' that you will discover makes the movie even better. I did not see that coming at all. A brilliant twist in the middle. Usually, there are twists at the end of the movie, but this one, the twist comes in the middle.
I didn't expect this movie to be this great. I love it when you don't have any expectations, and it ends up being even better than you thought.
100% worth seeing!!!"
118,This wasn't good and got bored of it! Not much point in the story and no real revelation as to why the mother did what she did!
119,"Its not the most original idea but well done ! movie is so nice to watch,actres are more then exelente ,especialy Sarah Paulson -shes becoming sinonime for great movie! Wherever i see hers name i know its gonna be great."
120,"I had been waiting for this movie for quite sometime seeing how it seemed very delayed due to covid I'm assuming. But it was worth the wait. I loved this movie. Sarah never disappoints and the young actress who plays Chloe (I can't remember the actress's name right at this moment) does an amazing job.
This film never bored me nor did it ever get slow. It had a few parts that shocked me enough to gasp out loud (haha) and kept my attention 100% til the end credits rolled. I am so glad this movie was as good as I was hoping it was...especially since I've been waiting for it for months and months. A+ film. Not disappointed and I'll definitely watch it again."
121,Great story with an awesome ending. Both actresses did a fantastic job of illustrating their character.
122,"Sarah Paulson is great channeling Misery's Kathy Bates as a deranged mother who'll stop at nothing to keep her invalid daughter from going off to college. While the performances are strong and some scenes really crackle with suspense, one sometimes wishes they embraced the nuttier aspects of the story to create something a little more memorable, because the story and Paulson's performance stop just short of being brilliant. I kept imagining this being directed by Curtis Harrington in the 70's starring someone like Shelley Winters."
123,"I agree with the Ac user that said nobody notices the mailman is missing? I had all the same thoughts. Too slow too many plotholes. I get the director wanted to use basic setting to see how he could pull it off. A few actors. Just a couple buildings, but when I would rather put on Home Alone for 56,000 time and writing this review before it ends, is a sign(pun) that this movie needed more work spark or is missing something. I agree seen it all before and done better. I think I will maybe just dig Misery out my movie collection. Oh and yeah, same as that other reviewer stated, She can just steal a baby? Lmao and who cares about the mailman or the thousands of opportunities the girl could of just hit her mom over the head or tell the right person. How about steal her moms phone and dial 911. Who was the guy she called anyway at the beginning. Pleasssseeee"
124,"This hat to be one the bad movie for Sarah Paulson.
The story was not original at all. And there was almost nothin happening in the movie."
125,"Has the same story with The Act. Don't want to spoil too much, but you'll get it if you've watched the mini-series. Only Sarah Paulson's acting is kinda-remarkable; the rest is just... meh. :) The ending could've been stronger, but not bad. After predicting the movie from 15th min., that ending couldn't satisfy me. But if you're a fan of the genre, you should give it a try. ;)"
126,"Sarah Paulson stellar acting and Kiera Allen's fantastic performance makes ""RUN""
a captivating, smart, intense thriller. The story is inducing and the buildup was really excellent, enjoyed from the beginning to the end."
127,"I like this film ; that surprised me alot ,I think it could be more horrible"
128,"Characters are developed perfectly until the end, and the punch line was worth the waiting."
129,I'm sorry but this is literally a rip off of a very serious story. I'm disappointed if people watch this and don't know the true story of Dee Dee and Gypsy Blanchard.
130,"It's not often I give a movie 8 stars on IMDB, but this movies deserves every one.The story is engaging and well paced with plenty of twists and turns, and a gradual build-up of tension.The characters are strong and believable, which is impressive considering that Kiera Allen (the girl in the wheelchair) has no acting experience in feature films, and very little elsewhere.Certainly one to watch."
131,"This film makes absolutely no attempt at hiding the fact that it's by all accounts a retread of ""Misery,"" with a Stephen King reference when An automated telephone operator that mentions Derry, Maine to a pharmacist named ""Mrs. Bates"" whose first name is revealed in the next scene to be ""Kathy."" It's as if the writer had caught a late-night ""Misery"" airing followed by a news break about Gypsy Rose Blanchard. The worst part is that every plot point could be so easily predicted from the very first scene. Hell, from the trailer alone for that matter! Sure, it's enjoyable if you're yet to burn out on Sarah Paulson. Just don't hold out hope for anything resembling a plot twist after you've realized you've seen it before. The final scene even refers to the newborn daughter as ""Annie.""
....and at the risk of sounding offensive, shouldn't it be called ""Roll?"""
132,They tried to give the character Chloe asthma but clearly have not ever seen an asthma attack. This movie is a joke
133,"Clever writing, unique directing, the acting was really good. You really feel the pressure and pain of this young lady. Beautifully shot, with great editing."
134,"Run is an excellent glimpse into malignant pathological psychopathy, something renarkably prevalent in our world today. Cheers."
135,I watched it from the start to falling asleep in under a half hour... RUN's like crap
136,"A solid but predictable thriller. A little disappointing as a follow up to Searching. Great debut from Kiera Allen.Director Aneesh Chaganty and co-writer Sev Ohanian struck gold with 2018's Searching. It's creative, original and gripping story hooked me from beginning to end. So it should go without saying that my level of excitement for their follow-up film Run would be quite high. I really wanted to love this film, but unfortunately it never quite reached the heights of joy I felt watching their debut effort.The story was just too paint-by-numbers to me. Run felt like the kind of plot you'd find in a typical cable movie. Despite this, Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen's performances were fantastic. Perhaps if the script had given us a bit more backstory to these characters, I would've felt more invested in the drama that enfolds between the 2nd and 3rd act.It's not to say that Run doesn't have some shining moments here and there. It's filmed exceptionally well for the most part and the scene at the pharmacy was well acted and intense. And while the execution of the final scene may have fallen short, I do appreciate the turnabout dynamic between mother and daughter."
137,"I must say, this movie was pretty clever. I'm sure medical professionals could poke holes in it, but I still feel like it is plausible enough to not be jarred out of the fiction by ridiculousness. That's kinda rare these days.
It's tense pretty much throughout. Saura Paulson is a great mom, of course. She's so good in everything.
A very fun and satisfying suspenseful movie."
138,"I chose to watch this movie without reading the description or ratings on IMDB, and I also did not watch any trailers for it. I am very glad I did that because after watching (and thoroughly enjoying) it, I went and watched the trailer... Which essentially showed the whole movie but in less than two minutes... I now understand why some people hated this film. However I cannot agree with that sentiment.
Many reviewers are describing it as rehashed, predictable and full of plot-holes... I don't think the trailer helped because it showed too much of what is a relatively simple, but not overly-used plot. I suppose many people don't realize that this film deals with a subject that is a real phenomenon, it has a medical name and everything, but is little known and hard to believe. Also, as many arm-chair quarterbacks are guilty of, it is easy to point out characters blunders and short-comings from the laz-e-boy with the benefit of being able to see all the way to the periphery of their situation on the big screen in front of you...
Here are the facts... Sarah Paulson brings a level of sinister to her character that I was not expecting having seen her in many other films, yet she also evokes empathy throughout. Newcomer Kiera Allen shocked me with how well she played against the veteran actress, displaying a natural acting ability that assures me she will have a successful career in Hollywood, despite the fact that she actually does use a wheel-chair in real life...
The cinematography is super solid utilizing static camera work, mid-closeups and camera angles which enhance the suspense and story-line.
This is a competent drama/ thriller, it is not a ""horror"" movie, and it is paced well, rationing out plot-points, and building the suspense and anticipation to a climax that will leave you satisfied with the end result... Which is a 6.5 IMHO"
139,"A secret was supposed to stay in the shadows
Critical for the life of a young girl
Once revealed the dark mind of a woman suffering of her real child lose, shows how cruel a human can be
What a wheelchaired girl will risk to get out free and alive?"
140,"Sarah Paulson gets a big lead in a feature film after years on American Horror Story and also gets one of her best, most interesting roles to date. Paulson plays the mother of a handicapped daughter who might be deliberately making her sick so she won't have to be alone. We've seen this material covered in both The Act (also on Hulu) and Ryan Murphy's The Politician (albeit in a much more comic light), but this is the most horrifying version of the DeeDee and Gypsy Rose Blanchard story to date with more emphasis on creating suspense and terror than pathos or laughs. The suspense is strong here and there were quite a few moments where I was on the edge of my couch, anxious about what was to happen next."
141,"Intriguing scenes , suspense ending, Kiera Allen is absolutely incredible, Great premise but too many missed opportunities to thrill."
142,"Sarah Paulson plays her characters beautifully. The film itself is unpredictable, from start to finish. Reminds me of a real story, with a completely different subtext."
143,"This is a very good way to spend your Saturday night. While the concept is not very original, the story had enough suspense to keep us on our toes. Very good acting by both main actors. Ending was good too, very satisfied. Every single shot made sense. This is not slow by any means. You could feel the tension building since the very beginning of the movie.This genre has been done so many times you cant find the most original story. But people 5 starts aint cutting it for this one."
144,"Sarah Paulson gives an incredible performance (as always) which kept me entertained through the entirety of the movie, however once it ended I found myself thinking...""that was kind of garbage."""
145,"""Run"" grabbed me like very few movies have been able to in recent times. The movie tells the tale of a loving mother who takes care of her physically handicapped,but extremely smart child.She's old enough to go to college now.She knows her science and is fiercely independent.What the creative team manages to achieve with this premise is absolutely fantastic.They manage to create suspense out of such little moments.There is great build-up,stakes are raised and then the payoff.The brilliant performances help a lot too.Kiera Allen knocks it out of the park.While one can nitpick about few details,at the end of the day the movie is an exhilarating watch and all is forgiven from my side.This would've been an awesome watch in a theater"
146,"From the low reviews. If you are that stupid that you watch a trailer for a movie that clearly indicates a plot twist than blame yourself.
It is not that predictable if you just watch the movie.
I will not give away anything from the plot. This is by far one of the better (yes) horror thrillers."
147,"Stressful the entire way through. I really don't get what people like about Sara Paulson though, I find her incredibly irritating in nearly everything that I've seen her in."
148,Sarah Paulson is always great. The young disabled Actress stole this Film! It reminded me of Whatever Happened to Baby Jane with Chloe being locked in her room. It also reminded me of Ransom because Chloe was kidnapped by a woman she believed was her Mom. Sarah always does what it takes to own her role. She was made up to look older than she is in real life and that to me is a great Actress.
149,"The premise is kind of good, the acting too. But it falls a bit short on the narrative side. Everything is wrapped up too quickly, it lacks atmosphere and development, compared to Misery or this type of movies that it takes from. There's too little mind control from Diane over her daughter, which should be a major point in order to make it really nerve-racking. As soon as one suspicion arises, it all goes too fast in the same direction, and I love thrillers to send me off-scent sometimes, on on emotional roller-coaster. Not the case here."
150,"The plot of the movie might feel very predictable and is done many times. And yes that might be true but that is the only thing considered negative. Sarah Paulson rocks in her roll also Kierra Allen is new talent to look for.The craftmanship done in this movie is top-notch. This is a brilliantly directed, meticulously acted thriller that keeps you on the edge from start to finish. Even if it does nothing original."
151,"It was quite good till the last few minutes, for me that ending ruined it..!"
152,"RUN (2020) was surprisingly better than I thought. I think it was originally meant to premiere in theaters until the COVID pandemic hit and delayed it among many major Hollywood productions. So it ended up on Hulu as one of their ""original"" movies. I'm still not 100% sure about how I feel on Sarah Paulson. While I generally think she's an actress who is very good at relaying deep emotions, there's also something annoying about her acting style as she has this languorous speech pattern like she's trying to hypnotize the person she's talking to. She's also famous for her nonstop crying and screaming. Anyone who has seen American Horror Story knows what I'm talking about. So, why, you ask, if I'm not the biggest Sarah Paulson fan (as so many people seem to be) am I rating this flick so highly? First, this is a very well done movie. Second, Paulson's hystrionics are dialed down immensely in this to the point I actually like her performance. Finally, Paulson is not the actual star of this piece. That honor goes to newcomer Kiera Allen in a brilliant film debut. It is Allen's character that really drives the plot.Run is the story of single mother Diane Sherman (Paulson) and her 17-year old daughter Chloe Sherman (Allen). Chloe was born with several debilitating birth defects, including paralysis, asthma, and diabetes. Diane has dedicated her life to care for Chloe, including home schooling, a strict dietary regimen, and supervising her medical care. A wheelchair-confined Chloe is pretty good at taking care of herself and is incredibly smart. Allen, who is actually disabled in real life, is a revelation as she is required to do many hair-raising physical stunts while still staying in character. And in actuality, Allen gets way more screen time than Paulson as the film is told almost completely from Chloe's POV. In particular, I like how incredibly smart and clever that Chloe is. Every move that makes feels like it's coming from a character with actual common sense. In fact, Chloe may be one of the smartest protagonists that I've ever seen in a horror movie. Plus, for once, the minor characters aren't dumb as a bag of rocks as they usually are in horror films.The first half of the film cleverly makes you wonder if there's really something off with Diane or is it all just in Chloe's mind. The second half pays it all off. It has an old-fashioned horror movie appeal with a very simple plot and believable characters. No tricks or silly special effects. Just a straightforward plot that allows the viewer to go along with Chloe on her journey of self-discovery as well as finding out the deal with her mother. Also, the ending is incredibly satisfying."
153,"This reminded me of the Deedee Blanchard account aka Mommy Dead and Dearest (2017), this is ok but the Deedee story is horrific"
154,"Diane Sherman (Sarah Paulson) is an overly protective mother to homeschooled wheelchair-bound teenager Chloe (Kiera Allen). Chloe grows suspicious of the pill her mother gives her.This is a nice little simple psychological horror. The script has a few minor flaws but I can deal with that. The pharmacist is way too stupid. It could have been fixed if she calls social services. That could have led to a tense scene when a social worker comes knocking at the door. Another scene is breaking the window. It's very unlikely to work and she could have just hit it with something like a hammer. When Chloe conveniently discovers everything, it would be more intense if she tries to placate her mother. Newcomer Kiera Allen is actually a pretty good actress and I would like her to try changing gears in her characterization. All in all, this is nice but it could be even better. It needs a bit more mystery. It could be smarter but it's still pretty good."
155,"The movie has some good thrills, and the story is great.
The actors do a fine job, and the pace of the movie is just fine."
156,"I enjoyed every minute in this film it's creepy, spooky and Nail biting. The acting is top notch and directed very well."
157,Sarah paulson and kiera allen did great in this movie.It was very tense and suspenseful with good camera work and a great director.Watch this
158,They gave everything away in the preview and the first 5 minutes. So it was just a matter of watching it play out and to be honest; I think I have seen a similar plot in the past.
159,"It kept me watching the whole time, it was super entertaining which is something I expect a movie to be, it really kept me at the edge of my seat for most of the movie, the ending it kind of messed up and twisted but it's good, what can I say? I don't want to give it away but it's worth the watch."
160,"The plot is both simple and familiar but 'Run' is skilfully and cleverly directed by Aneesh Chaganty, thrilling, and most importantly, fun. Sarah Paulson and Kiera Allen turn in excellent performances. Also, kudos for how the movie treats a person with a disability not as weak and helpless and, ultimately, the victim of circumstances beyond her control, but as someone who is just as capable to be the heroine in a tale."
161,"Sharp Objects, The Act, and now Run. They all end differently didn't expect anything either."
162,"This movie was actually a good entertaining idea to me. However, this movie was rushed. The props were placed in all the right places to help the daughter which to me even showed more of how much of a movie this was. The movie was okay. This movie was weird. Asthma attacks were badly acted. I hate the Sarah Paulson scream.The parts of the movie I did like was finding out that the daughter was actually a robbed baby from the hospital"
163,"This movie kept me engaged up until the last minute...the best thing about it is the incredible performence delivered by Kiera Allen, i would love to see her on other works."
164,"Before, I thought it would be an intriguing movie and one filled with suspense. Now, I am disappointed by the bleak story it holds. So many questions were just answered.. delicately. Kiera Allen though, delivered an apt performance. The concept of an 'evil mother' did not have a supporting story. You will meet with a few disappointments. It does however fit in the 'Mystery' criteria even though the mysteries were met with delicate answers."
165,"Está buena, pero es imposible ahora no compararla con la serie The Act, es algo o bastante predecible pero Paula es una gran actríz de suspenso"
166,Run is a thriller suspense movie i enjoy that film till end Sarah is my favourite actress and she play her role in that movie in right way great job sarah
167,This writer/Director stole this entire story and script from season 19 episode episode 10 of Law & Order SVU.How did this film even get made?
168,"This is the story of a paralyzed girl. She is very sick and she is taking many medications per day. One day she realizes that there is something wrong with her medications. She suspects her mom who is taking care of her. She tries to figure out what is wrong, and this is when the story kind of starts. The story is amazing and innovative. Kiera Allen and Sarah Paulson played very well in this movie. The sound effects and background music is awesome. Most of the story is happening in a house. But, some of the stories happen in other locations. In summary, if you are a fan of horror and thriller genres, I recommend this movie to you."
169,"This was entertaining from start to finish, without relying on classic tropes to keep it interesting but rather perfectly referencing the great films like Misery and Psycho. Barely any blood was shed and there were no squeamish nail-on-chalkboard techniques -- just pure cat and mouse cleverness with a dark angle."
170,"All of the acting in this movie is absolutely fantastic. Kiera Allen stole the show. The pacing was also perfect for a thriller. The huge, glaring problem with this movie is that the plot makes no sense. It can't be possible that not a single person noticed something strange going on. It also makes no sense how Chloe didn't discover something that tipped her off sooner. The more you examine the plot, the more holes you will find. Overall I enjoyed watching it, but it was just too unbelievable."
171,"I was a big fan of Aneesh Chaganty's debut film 'Searching'. It was creative, original and best of all it was a gripping and clever story. It was one of my few perfect 10 scores for 2018. So needless to say I was very excited for his follow-up film 'Run'. I really wanted to love this film, but I just couldn't. I enjoyed it, no doubt about that, but it never managed to grip me and put me on the edge of my seat needing to know what was going to happen next.The story was just a little bit basic for me. It felt like the kind of plot you'd find in a Lifetime movie. It was just simply made with much more class behind the camera and far better actors than those films typically get. The film does have a PG-13 rating which is usually a red flag of a very safe movie, however 'Searching' had the same rating so I wasn't too worried about that. 'Run' did feel extremely safe though. Any minor scenes of violence that do occur typically happen off screen for the most part. The pacing in this film also seemed just a little off. There are some very over-long and drawn out scenes with not a lot going on.The acting in this film is superb. Sarah Paulson gives her everything to the role. She's almost worth an entire extra point for the film all by herself. Also new-comer Kiera Allen in her debut film blew me away. I would never have guessed that she was new to the industry. There's some good stuff in 'Run' and it is made exceptionally well for the most part. I just feel the plot has been done far too many times before and for that reason in particular this film will be gone from my mind a week from now."
172,From someone who regularly watches horror movies this is one of the only ones I can say kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning. I would say that this was one of my favorite movies. From the beginning it is nothing short of chilling. As a tough movie critic I would say there is not a thing I would change about this movie.
173,This movie so far has been amazing and it's crazy that this happens in real life. I am not going to lie Sarah Paulson always scared me lol she's amazing actress so I can see her being crazy in this movie. I mean look at American horror story and the show ratched it was good too. She's just amazing. This movie is really good must watch.
174,Really Liked it. Especially the ending. Paula does great as usual. Teenage daughter great as well. Predictable but fun movie to watch during this pandemic.
175,This is much different from The Act. It's another true story about a mother that's equally as crazy. It's very good. People need to understand it's not a twist on The Act. It actually happened.
176,I could see how is was going to end the first 15 min. it was not the actors fault. the story sucked
177,Im not see him!!but is always BAD.the carater is bad and
178,"This film start with a mother ""Diane"" watching her dying baby, and she attending the Home School Association meeting scene! As turnout, this film is about a paralysis girl ""Chloe"" need to escape from Diane, who abduct Chloe as her daughter, and constantly poison Chloe! Entire film full of boring conversation, and super annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the vomiting scene, overuse of the taking medicine scene, overuse of the staring scene, overuse of the crawling scene, overuse of the searching things scene, and overuse of the dining scene! Make the film unwatchable! Barely intense scene is, the police shot at Diane! At the end, Diane been shot and fell to the downstairs! Chloe poisoning Diane at the very end! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
179,"Plot holes galore. Non sensical actions. Sarah Paulson is one of my least liked actors working today, just can't stand her performances and never once can you believe she is a ""real"" person. The ""twist"" was easily figured out after the first 30 seconds. What the hell was she doing with that pointy thing attached to a extension chord and why did spitting water on a window make it explode?? Couldn't she just throw a heavy object at it? So you can get medication for a dog that doesn't exist for 17 years? What+how?! Are there no security cameras in any hospitals anymore?! Is the daughter completely isolated at this house and never allowed out or to socialize? Wouldn't that tip her off right away her mother is a nut bag?? Why even bother letting her apply to college so you can just hide her acceptance letters? Wouldn't you just not send them and pretend? Daughter isn't allowed a cell phone or access to the internet? Hmmm, wonder if my mom is a loony! Ending was weird too, with an added ""twist"" that didn't align with our main character at all and made her look like a psycho. Fun for a mindless watch but a piece of crap none the less"
180,"Loved this film, I could not predict the plot as it had a number of twists throughout and kept you on edge guessing what could happen next."
181,Enjoyable thriller but nothing special. After the success Hulu had with the act (which is brilliant if you haven't seen) they clearly decided to condense the same story into a 90 minute film. But to be fair I did enjoy the end twist and I really rooted for Chloe.
182,"First of all, let us forget the fact that this film's director's first film was Searching. If you start comparing Run with Searching it wouldn't do justice to this film. Run sets up a mysterious tone with Chloe, the protagonist who is paralyzed leg-down, growing suspicious about her mother. We are hooked to the screen from the beginning, confronting the conflicts through the perspective of Chloe. This is a very wonderful debut for Kiera Allen who plays Chloe. Sarah Paulson makes us apprehensive with her expressions throughout the film making us distrust her. Aneesh Chaganty proves to be innovative even though at the end of the film you get to take a simple story with you.
The simple story may make you underestimate the film getting to know it through the course of the film makes the viewing experience so exciting. This is for sure a one time watch but that one time you watch is gonna be a great ride which you won't regret. Don't compare the film with Searching but we can't call this a bad film at all. Give it a watch."
183,"This is the most terrifying movie I've seen in a very long time. Gripping, holding you in and then take you down streets you didn't think they'd be brave enough to go. There's a lot of garbage out there, but this isn't one of them. Acting was convincing as well. Felt like watching a home video than a film. I'm stunned and feel the terror as I write this. You'd have to be numb not to at least like this."
184,"It started off a little bit slow not exactly sure where the story was taking you but once it gained momentum it became an ""edge of your seat"" type of movie and Sarah Paulson brought this whole story to together exceptionally well. This was more than worth watching."
185,"Engrossing thriller but definitely felt less fresh or original than Searching, which I unfortunately was never going to be able to help comparing this to. Paulson delivers as always."
186,"I really loved the way they unfolded the thing with style and beautiful technique. But it was the ending that really messed me up, I thought it was all over and the extra extra ending really was very engaging although a lil' obscure for I did not truly understand her motives and intentions with the protagonist's mom but still it was very nice. Whomever was involved in the thing did a fine fine fine really cool job! For a mommy roll , this one is definitely a seminal character no one will ever forget!"
187,"Kiera Allen is really great. I love her.
Waiting for next projects. Good luck."
188,I liked the premise and the performances were good but repeated implausibility prevents your suspension of disbelief and ultimately undermines the film. Especially the ending. Ridiculous.
189,"After watching Searching, I was looking forward to watch this one. However I utterly disappointed. Storyline is weak and quite predictable to me. And even the movie couldn't grasp my attention."
190,"The acting is great, Sarah Paulson and her colleague did great jobs.
The film has you waiting on the edge of your seat for something that never arrives.
When I see a bad movie, I just forget about it within minutes... This movie made me write a review. +2 for the actress'""Long drawn out suspenseful thriller"" if i had to categorize it"
191,"Some said this movie was predictable but most movies are - this wasn't just about the suspense, it was the game of hide and seek an it was really good. Not one moment was slow, this movie deserved better ratings"
192,"I don't think anyone will find this movie timely due to what tagline says. This is far to predictable as many say, right until the end been used so many times there not even funny. The acting is good, Sarah always knows to up the scenery in any movie. Give it a weekend look is nothing better to stream at that point."
193,Awful i was embarrassed for Sarah good acting awful movie
194,"Although the story is far from original, it's still a superb film with some great acting and even better plot twists.Edit: I've just found out that Chloe was played by a real wheelchair user, so I've given an extra star for authenticity."
195,"Reminds me a bit of S. King's Misery; shades of it throughout, although the underlying MO throughout is MUCH different. And with a much CREEPIER twist in the end, like it wasn't creepy enough until that point."
196,"It's pacing is slower than a snail.. i watched it on 200% speed, and even that wasn't enough. You won't miss anything even at that speed because nothing much is happening.
Script is idiotic, as coincidentally everything goes against, till it all changes due to another coincidence!!
Munchasen by proxy is something rap musician sang a decade ago, guess the whole movie unit never heard of it. Skip it unless you like where viewers are taken as dumb idiots without a choice!"
197,"Seriously, even the most casual of movie watcher should be able to figure out exactly what's going to happen in this movie just by reading the one sentence synopsis on here. It's that predictable. I think I've watched this exact same movie at least ten times. Girl is handicapped and lives with overbearing mom. Girl finds out that she has no illnesses and is being drugged by mom. Mom dies. The end. I expected more from the director of Searching."
198,New kind of thriller. Can't imagine what is actually going on.
199,"This was such a great thriller (don't watch the movie trailer though, it gives too much away).The acting was great. Sarah Paulson does creepy so so well. Kiera Allen did great as well. Still can't forget her face at the end of the movie when she says ""Open up..."".Overall, very enjoyable 1.5 hours. The movie was perfect for what it sets out to do.DON'T WATCH THE TRAILER!!"
