0,I really don't know what people think they're entitled to see every time they choose a movie. Whoever was responsible for this movie gave it their best shot. Great care was clearly taken in the photography and set design. A story that's a little different with actors who give it their all. Give it a break.
1,"As I started watching I just kept thinking why all the negative reviews, this is one of the best war/horror movies. Interesting premise, good acting, chilling atmosphere. I just loved it; but as the movie got to the end, it turned complete 180 & made a fool out of it's audience,the twist was just out of nowhere & completely ridiculous. It's as if the writer hated writing this movie & wanted it to fail. It would've been a fine supernatural horror movie if it stickied to what it started out with; but no, the writer had to subvert the audience expectation. He must've been thinking he was so brilliant to come up with this lame ending. God, what a disappointment, an hour and half down the toilet all because of the ending. A perfectly fine horror movie ruined because the writer had to write this stupid nonsensical ending. What a waste of time & talent."
2,"If you like war horrors such as The Objective, Trench 11, or The Bunker you will be OK with this. Its competently acted. Actually Kyle Gallner the lead from the mini-series ""Interrogation"" has a major supporting role in this movie. He is a good fit as the enigmatic squad sniper and its worth watching just for him. The horror effects seem a little cheesed but there is a reason for that. The movie has a decent twist to the plot, and for that reason I urge you to stop reading the reviews and watch the movie, as people are saying too much around here."
3,"The first half of this movie is actually interesting and this movie blends a WWII theme with a paranormal theme quite well. However after the initial setup has passed this movie stalls and can't seem to find out how to best continue the action or wrap up an ending. Some jump scares and a few creepy scenes but nothing overly engaging or worth noting.Then it's almost like the director had to wrap up shooting or ran out of money as the ending is rushed and is over in maybe 5-8 mins. Eric Bress writes and directs this and is most noted for the Final Destination series and the Butterfly Effect, 10-15 years ago. Sadly he hasn't created nothing in between now and then and hasn't learned how to create a good ending yet."
4,"This movie started ok. Good acting, good plot, good decor, even the storyline was unusual and a great new idea for a ghost movie.
However, I only have one thing to say about the ending...W...T...F...!!!.
Maybe I missed something, but if that ending would have been different, I would have given 9/10. Too bad !!!"
5,"I have absolutely no idea why people are complaining about the ending. I absolutely thought it was brilliant. In fact I liked the ending so much I'm giving it a 9. Without the twist ending I would have scored it a 7. I like a movie that subverts genre so you can't predict where it's going. To tell more would spoil the fun. I enjoyed it so much I went back and re-watched it multiple times. That's how good it is!!!!This is not an action war movie and more a mix of war, mystery, drama, supernatural and even Sci-Fi. The character development is well done and the story just pulled me in. I could not predict where the story was going which is why it's so enjoyable. And the ending is bonkers but beautifully ties everything together. Simply brilliant. I was about to pass on this because of the lame title and cover art plus I'm not into ghost and horror movies. The poor reviews didn't help either but I'm glad I took a chance. This is one of the best original movies I've seen. It's right up there with Get Out.Looking at the reviews I am not sure why people are complaining about the ending. I really liked the ending as it breaks horror conventions and it even fits in with the clues dropped in the first and second act. Maybe viewers were looking for more horror type fare which this is but is more than that. The story also nicely wraps around itself from beginning to end and maybe that's why viewers were disappointed as there were still loose ends and unanswered questions. I definitely enjoyed it and IMO it's worth a watch."
6,"So much promise in this film. Good acting, great setting and location, pretty much everything a quality film needs, just to fall off at the end.Everything was looking good, the final ""twist"" was a little outrageous, though they lead up to it pretty well, littering little clues here and there, letting the audience know things weren't quite what they appeared. It just fell off short of any real resolution though, leaving the story open-ended.Would have been a 8/10, but had to dock points for not properly finishing an otherwise good film."
7,"Beautifully shot with great cinematography, but the story gradually disappoints because its thematic ambitions add more clutter than depth to a story that's most effective at its simplest. The convoluted ""twist"" either needed to be omitted, or expanded upon with another 15+ minutes. It's as if the budget ran out and everyone just wrapped it up as fast as they could with no regard for a cohesive storyline. It's a shame, because it had potential. It's a generous 6/10 from me."
8,"Ghosts of War started out great. It felt like it could be the prefect combination of Band of Brothers and House on Haunted Hill. The premise is simple: U.S. World War 2 soldiers ordered to hold down a strategic location in France, which happens to be a haunted chateau where Nazi soldiers previously committed horrible crimes. I really had high hopes for this film but as it progressed those hopes diminished. The setting is great and the film relies on appropriately creepy atmospheric tension. I mean they're in a really big creepy castle full of strange occurrences. Whats not to like about that? On top of that, the main cast of soldiers were likable. I enjoyed seeing Theo Rossi, who you might recognize as Shades from Marvel Studios/Netflix' Luke Cage series. Alan Ritchson, Brenton Thwaites, and Kyle Gallner, my favorite of the group who played U.S. army sniper Tappert, where all very good.Unfortunately....and this is a big huge deal-breaker for me, the ending did not live up to the rest of the film. This is me being nice about it. To be honest it infuriated me. It made me feel like I wasted 1hr and 34 minutes getting invested in this story which suddenly transformed into something that I was not expecting nor wanted. All they had to do is stick with the theme of WW2 soldiers stuck in a haunted house during war. That's it. How they managed to ruin the last part of this film defies logic. Someone should be fired over this horrendous decision. I want to recommend it based on how good most of the film was, but the ending completely destroyed my recommendation. Yes, it's THAT BAD."
9,"Interesting movie with a good amount of action and mystery. Good story with lots to expect but falls a bit short overall.
But its the ending which is memorable for all the wrong reasons.....basically there isn't one and would benefit from someone explaining it. Not a waste of time, but definitely unsatisfactory because of this."
10,"The wife and I watched this on Amazon Prime. While the ending could have been played out a little better, I felt like we enjoyed the movie."
11,"So the start of this movie was pretty good, acting very good, great story.
Then suddenly it turns things around and you get to know the 'real' story. However, at the very end they just 'stop' the movie and that's it.It could have been so much better, the ending simply ruined it completely for me."
12,"I enjoyed the movie... as I enjoy most WW2 movies/shows. It was great up until he realises theres a bug in the program, goes back in and then.... that was it... its like the writers couldn't work out what to put next and had the movie finish.If they don't plan on a sequel, the really should have made a better ending... i'm expecting a directors cut with the extra 30-40 minutes of footage this theatrical version offered..."
13,It's rare these days to find a genuine horror/ ghost flick. This is solid with non of the amateur shaky iPhone footage that cheap filmmakers rely on these days. Really great cinematography and decent cgi.
14,"I enjoy how things evolve in this movie. When you think you know, maybe you don't, maybe you do.
For me it's a great movie. No error in the casting, no problem with the story. On the contrary, it's well filmed, and overall very well done."
15,"Is this a WW2 movie or Afghanistan war movie? Is it a horror movie or a morality play? The writers should go back to the drawing board. Disjointed plot and really obtuse ending. Kinda like a peanut butter and ketchup sandwich.
May the ghosts haunt the movie writers for eternity!"
16,Could have been a really good horror movie and acting was good but the stupidest ending to a movie I've seen. As if the director couldn't decide how to end it so didn't even try. You might end up feeling like... WTF? Is that the ending?
17,"Slow build up. I agree with the bad editing in the beginning. But, it wasn't that bad. Ending was unexpected. It was not a waste of time."
18,"The movie is interesting just the first 25 minutes. Then it starts to go down and sinks by itself. The script is a joke. Pretty bad. Looks like someone that was high wrote this. The last 5 minutes and the ending are by far the worst I have watched in a long time. Overall, a wasted opportunity because the cast is acceptable for a horror B movie.
Just make yourself a favor and watch Overlord instead."
19,"I know horror movies generally have a much lower score than other genres. A horror above 5 is decent, and below 4.6 is garbage. With that being said, I really enjoyed this one and it should be above 6 (10 stars to improve average). Best 2020 horror so far. I loved that two Titans actors were in it (Brenton Thwaits and Alan Ritchson). The jump scares were brilliant, the storyline decent and the actors were on par.Ignore negative reviews, obviously not major horror fans, especially of the spirit/ghost/curse genre."
20,"I was anxiously waiting for this horror flick, especially in these hard times when you aren't overwhelmed by movies, but it turned out this was a huge mistake.
Since butterfly effect It looks like Eric Bress has forgotten how to direct a good film. His latest flick is filled with poor and lame visual effects, the ghosts are not scary whatsoever, in addition to this there is no any atmosphere and tension in the sequences, last but not least the plot itself is a complete mess.The design of the manor and the production design is nothing extraordinary, to say the least, in some cases it looks pretty bad and cheap-looking.Eric Bress doesn't have the slightest idea how to direct a decent horror movie, the twist in the end makes no sense, it's quite ludicrous and eventually makes this flick far worse than I expected."
21,Great concept started really good than jumped from scene to scene without any connection like they ran out of money and decided to cut out parts for short run time dont know than suddenly we're pulled out ww2 and into modern day Afghanistan some kind of simulation to help them recover but dialogue was all over the place lead asked to get put into simulation again to save others than as he entered the movie ended without showing how he saved his friends or himself WTF DID I WATCH?
22,"Anyone who's watched more than four or five movies has almost certainly encountered bitter disappointment with an ending. It's common enough that one has to be braced for that outcome with every movie one watches. You know, just in case. GHOSTS OF WAR raises the phenomenon of the bad ending to a religious experience. You know, the one where you shriek ""oh God I'm in hell!"" out loud.The much rarer, even unique, experience that GHOSTS OF WAR provides the viewer is that of seeing a movie that has been sailing along rather well suddenly decide, apparently from instant onset dementia, to commit storytelling suicide in the most grisly manner possible right at the end. It was literally astonishing to see. It was as bad as ""and he woke up and it was all a dream"" but carried to such an astounding extreme that your mind almost refuses to accept it while you're seeing it unfold in front of you. From moment to moment, just as you repeatedly think ""NOW this can't possibly get any worse"", it DOES.For the first hour and twelve minutes, GHOSTS OF WAR is a middling acceptable horror/ghost movie. It has its share of faults and foibles, as does even the best horror/ghost movie, which is apparently the nature of the genre as far as I can tell, but all in all it's reasonably well crafted, has excellent production values, and features a handful of namebrand, well-established actors. I might not describe its build quality as excellent, but it's at least very good.It's World War II and a small handful of soldiers, about five or so as I recall, are dispatched to relieve another small group of soldiers who are babysitting a good sized rural mansion that had been used by the Nazis as a field headquarters. In a bit of foreshadowing, the group of soldiers they are relieving practically run out of the building when our group arrives, departing so rapidly one of them even leaves a personal rucksack behind.Since we know it's a horror/ghost picture to begin with set in a building that's intrinsically creepy from top to bottom with lots of odd bits in evidence that could easily be ghost-spoor, it's not long before the paranormal fertilizer hits the ventilator.The setting is not unique in the genre, of course. Given the stupefying bloodiness of World War II, the widespread sociopathic insanity of the Nazis, the Nazi obsession with the occult, the made-for-a-potboiler level of advancement of the Nazi experimental weaponry, and so on, the whole World War II/Nazi ""thang"" is hyper-ripe soil for any plot line having to do with supernatural horror. And so, as you might expect, the number of Nazi oriented horror pictures became uncountable decades ago. The fact that GHOSTS OF WAR excavated from this particular mine is not a bad thing. It would be hard to argue that the vein isn't endless.And so here's the movie, sailing along, dropping satisfying horror tropes left and right (people being dragged along by invisible hands, haunting scenes of misery and torture being played out over and over in proper paranormal style, bangings and clangings and a large smorgasbord of inexplicable and terrifying sounds, etc.) when suddenly the whole thing detonates with the grace of a pig that swallowed a hand grenade.So it doesn't just have a bad ending, you get to see a pretty darn good movie, in the blink of an eye, just abruptly impale itself on the punji stick of unforgivably bad writing. In my experience, that's not something you see every day. You kind of expect movies that weren't very good from the beginning to have bad endings in keeping with the rest of the movie. It's a whole 'nother thing to see a movie that was doing fine suddenly slam into the ground without warning.I would describe the ending to you but for two reasons.Firstly, it would be like watching a movie that suddenly flings a scene involving coprophilia at you; it was an unpleasant shock to begin with, you didn't want to see it the first time, now you can't un-see it, and you sure as heck don't want to write a description of it.Secondly, if you're the type of person who likes watching train wrecks, and you would have to be to want to see this movie, a written description is just going to spoil the fun for you anyway. Go watch it yourself."
23,"Good mix of ww action and horror with decent acting, dialogs and CGI.
Plot twists are fine, the movie is a fresh and interesting ride from start to finish, absolutely worth the time."
24,"Starts like its an OK movie, starts to drag on, then the disappointment hits, with a really bad ending. That's 2 hours of my life I won't get back."
25,"It started off ok, the ok/meh cast was sufficient (although I find Thawites to be very mediocre, and bland all at once in everything he plays) and the premise was good. But there wasn't enough good acting to get this over the finish line. It felt more meh than anything. And the ending was going well until the very last scene which was absolutely, positively and unequivocally nonsensical. Two stars for the effort but this was definitely a misfire. I guess this was the supposed ""scary"" version of Source Code...but it wasn't."
26,"For the most part I was enjoying the story and the movie itself until the last half hour when it all went awry and just got silly and then ended abruptly without a close and left me feeling they had just stolen the movie and my time along with it.I'm not sure when this trend in the movies to leave the audience alienated from the end of a story started but I really wish they would stop doing it,it's not clever,it's not artsy,it is just annoying and leaves an audience feeling robbed."
27,"So this film came out quietly to Video on Demand earlier in the year but it has now hit Netflix so I have watched it and here is my review for the film Ghosts Of War. The premise of the film sees a group of soldiers arrive at a French Mansion during WW2, not only do they have to deal with Nazis but also a supernatural threat.Main Character
Brenton Thwaites who plays Dick Grayson on Titans plays the lead here and he is nothing more then functional, he has got some talent as an actor and has proven on that show that he can be good and for me he was the best character here. Though that really isn't saying much, he just has very little character here and despite everything you won't care about him and whatever comes of him in the film.Supporting Characters
There is a group of soldiers with him played by actors Kyle Gallner, Alan Ritchson, Theo Rossi & Skylar Astin and you will not care about any of them whatsoever. They have done other okay things but they are given nothing to work with and you literally won't care about any of them and whether they live or die and that really hurts the overall product.Story
The story is pretty by the numbers, well until we get to the end of the film which I will go into in a minute. There is a tense feeling about the film and it keeps you and the characters on edge and as I said there is a twist late on in the film and I am not sure what to make of it. It feels like it comes out of nowhere and feels out of place but I usually criticise horror films for being generic so fair play to this film for trying something different. But I think we can all agree that the very end of the film is terrible, no spoilers but it is so unfulfilling and feels like a cheap way to end the film.Script
The script is really bad, the dialogue is as dull as dishwater and it helps to make the characters so uninspiring and dull and make you not care about them. The twist aside there is pretty much no creativity and it is a film that you have seen over and over again.Style
The film does have a very tense feeling and does a decent job of portraying that, it makes the house they are in feel like a dangerous place. But I thought the pacing of the film was very slow, it was only 90 mins long but it felt much longer and that made the film drag a lot for me.Overall
Overall, this is a poor horror film, there will be plenty of these every year and even though this tries to change things up it fails overall and is one you can skip."
28,"Films with endings like this are what have started to put me off watching random little films on streaming services. They always try to do something different which is admirable, but how many of them stick the landing? A poor ending that still makes sense is better than a random ending that makes you feel annoyed at the fact you gave a film like this a chance in the first place. Maybe thats just karma?I'll start the actual review by saying this movie isnt all bad. The acting is pretty steady but its Kyle Gallner and Skylar Austin who give the better performances of the bunch. They feel like they have more to do which may be why i feel this way. The cinematography is nice and looks pretty authentic for the most part for a world war movie. It reminded me of the movie Overlord which was released just a few years ago which i really enjoyed. This film at first seemed to have a similar idea, trading zombies for ghosts, so i decided to give it a watch.However the film falls apart quickly. In order to be a horro film you have to be scary. This misses all the marks and fails with cheap jumpscares. None of the characters are really that interesting making it hard to grasp a connection to any of them.You may have seen other reviews criticising the ending. I have to agree its certainly quite bizarre and different. I didnt mind this, but just when you think your going to get one final scene/battle whatever you want to call it, the movie ends. Its a very very weird choice.Overall, some good acting and an interesting premise but the only scary thing about this film is its lack of conviction. 4/10"
29,"Wow. So this starts out as an interesting movie. You think they made some timeline mistakes citing a couple movies that were made after WW@, but it turns out they didnt.That's the twist.And the twist is really really bad.When you get to the last quarter of the film it's a WTF moment that turns into a Why moment.The entire movies is completely ruined by the ending and the twist. It's moronic. And Billy Zane is in the movie for 5 minutes, in case you were wondering.Can't recommend this flick. The ending was just way too bad."
30,"This film start with a soldier ""Chris"" seeing an unknown person at the woods, and a bunch of soldiers chatting scene! As turnout, this film is about a bunch of wounded soldiers deploy at Afghanistan taking a simulation World War II test, and the act eventually summon the supernatural force into human world! Entire film full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Such as, overuse of the dreaming scene, overuse of the jump scare scene, and overuse of the searching things scene! Make the film unwatchable! The action scene have explosion and quite bloody at certain point, but overall not intense, and low satisfaction! At the end, we found out Chris actually in the simulation lab! Chris suggest him back to the simulation test to dealing with the supernatural force! Chris back to the woods, and no fighting scene at all, just end like that! That's it! Really wasting time to watch!"
31,"It was a good movie, good story and satisfying characters until it became a sci-fi film"
32,The beginning is interesting then it loses all sense
33,"Another movie that people over think or expect Shakespeare on film when it's a horror with a small budget. Let's sum it up, great cinematography, great acting, great story. Great special effects, only flaw is bad ending. The ending leaves questions I just ended it with I felt the writer thought. I was extremely entertained through the whole film it features excellent acting by a mostly unheard of crew but throughly enjoyed it. Was nice to see billy Zane again hes an extremely Underrated actor even though it's not a big role. Watch it and ignore the haters who obviously dont get good movies and expect a mediocre ending."
34,"I cannot understand the low ratings here. Seriously... To me personally this is a very rarely well conceived film where you can tell a lot of thought went into it. It most certainly isn't your usual quickie slam/bang Horror film, but I feel that it is quite well written, acted, and executed. I KNOW that the ending is very divisive and about 1/2 of the people won't like it and about half (like me : ) REALLY love it!The main thing that impressed me about this one is the clever concept and the intelligence behind it. At the beginning you may understandably think, 'Oh this is just another one of THOSE films' because of the War elements and the Supernatural overtones. BUT... it is honestly not what it seems. With so many Horror films cranked out these days and mostly of dubious quality, when one comes along that to me anyway is this clever and well done, I really enjoy it! The acting across the board was very good. The characters could have VERY easily come across as cliched stereotypes, but they truly did not at all. They were real, dimensional, believable people. I felt that the writing was definitely above average too.This film is very intelligent, engaging, and suspenseful. It really keeps a strong grip on you all the way through and it keeps the audience guessing. And, without giving anything away (avoid Spoilers at all cost!) a great clever ending which even naysayers admit you will ***NOT*** see coming. Again, the ending WILL indeed divide people. I think what the deal is, is that if you have a super active imagination and you really like Sci Fi tinged Horror, and you don't mind imaginative 'leaps', then you will love it. But, if you are more of a practical person who prefers a more 'conventional' explanation, then this one may truly throw you. So, with that in mind, overall, this film is very well made, cleverly written, and very competently directed and acted. Even if you do not particularly love the ending or find it 'far-fetched', I think most people will appreciate all the thought and effort that went into making it."
35,"1. A stupid B movie tried to be an A movie!2. Stupid story, a lot worse than Overlord.3. WWII soldiers had same military training as modern days training or vise versa?4. The mansion is not convincing, not luxurious enough, cheaply made!5. Why the director thought all audiences are idiots, the movie is full of flaws and contradictions!"
36,"Hidden gem, brilliant brilliant brilliant. All praise to to Eric Brass. Some people who watched/reviewed this film are idiots. An ending like this film is what made this film because it didn't ""follow"" the norm, it had an excellent twist, no one could have predicted, hence unique, which, after all, is what we all like"
37,"I was really enjoying this movie. Toward the end I couldn't understand why it ended the way it did. I had to rewind it a few times to try to understand it. Bummed me out it just didn't make any sense😤. I thought it would be something scary like ""Outpost"" with the scary Nazi's. I wish I could get my money back 😫"
38,"This starts off quite well - a group of American squaddies are charged with occupying a chateau in France towards the end of WWII. Once ensconced, however, they start to hear things going bump in the night and soon discover that the Nazis had carried out the particularly brutal murders of the family who had lived there before, and that that family possibly hadn't quite left! Cuties Brenton Thwaites (""Chris"") and Kyle Gallner (""Tapert"") are decent enough as they lead their men in the hunt for the truth and at times it's a well constructed and paced (don't go looking for any meaningful dialogue) ghost story with some above-average special effects. Sadly, though, after about an hour it all goes seriously off piste and we start having science and Afghanistan (and Billy Zane) enter into the plot and we slide down a slippery slope to ridiculousness. Pity!"
39,"What started out strong ended extremely weak. This film had all the right stuff in all the right places and just fizzled out like a fizz ball in the bath.What ever the writers and producers thought they were doing... I somehow think they didn't realise what an absolute flop this film would become.It had awesome moments of mystery, suspense and a fright or two... and then it all went to hell in a hand basket.Such a pity! A non-impressed 4 out of 10 circles of madness for this dirty washing!"
40,"Though relatively low budget, it's quite a clever film which does not turn out the way you think"
41,"Not at bad as some of the reviews made it out to be. I get the plot twist, just feels a bit rushed.
Could've done without the futuristic dream simulation but worth a watch."
42,"Don't let anyone tell you this didn't earn the ending, or didn't make sense, or anything like that. It's well done, clues are scattered throughout, and the end was perfect."
43,"The movie started great and keep me watching, the middle was like ok ...but the end was a terrible mistake. So bad."
44,"For 90% of this movie, I was pleasantly surprised. The acting and characterisations were on-point, the atmosphere and sets haunting and creepy. The plot winds it way through, it pulls no punches with the reality of war, gruesome in places. Then just when the reveal is done, it changes, in effect, ""It was all a dream."" the lamest trope in screen production. No, that wasn't smart, and the 'cliffhanger' ending only adds to the complete screw-up and confusion. So close."
45,"Very much a film of two halves, a very good first half, and a pretty awful second half.Early on, I loved the atmosphere, the implied threat, and the build up, it had a really eerie, uncomfortable feeling, and then.... The Soldiers take out a German platoon, and it all goes to pot. They took a really interesting ghost story, and stripped away its identity, a real shame, it was leading somewhere.The clues were there, and at some point didn't somebody mention horror movies?I applaud them for trying something different, had they stuck to the original course, it would have been an 8, you got to see how some o the soldiers behaved, and the harrowing events they must have witnessed.Good at the start, shocking at the end, still worth a look, 6/10."
46,Really nice movie right up untill the end. It is a really good movie with ghosts that didn't really needed the ghosts in the final scenes. The actual reality and how certain things can affect a humans psihic is way more frightening then any made up ghosts or curse are. It had the perfect ending to an otherwise well made script if only they would have stopped like 2 mins earlier. Shame.
47,"70 % of them have crappy endings. This is possible the worst one by now. Otherwise it looked like a decent A-movie.
Don´t they get that I´m going to avoid movies from that director in the future?"
48,"This movie is simply not good. You're hooked in for the first 20 or so minutes, but halfway through the plot becomes ridiculous. The special effects and CGI for the ""ghosts"" is laughable and the jumpscares are cheap and predictable. The ending leaves you full of disappointment and regret. Save yourself the hour and thirty-five minutes and watch something else. Would not recommend."
49,"The movie started out with an interesting story and would have remained a watchable movie experience had the twist not been so far out of left field.Quite a few jumpscares and a creepy-ish atmosphere with good acting for the most part, though unfortunately the writers decided to veer completely off in the last 10 minutes or so, making this a laughable mockery of what it could have been and lost it a few points in my rating.Not Recommended."
50,"REVIEW - GHOSTS OF WARThe second world war was horrific with what was done to innocent people but what if.....A group of American soldiers are assigned to guard a mansion from the occupying Nazi forces when strange unexplained things start to happen.I have to admit I thoroughly enjoyed this film until.....Basically the biggest issue with this, what could have been one of the best horror films of this year, is that for some unknown reason the film literally loses its own plot, as if those who made it suddenly thought we're running out of money / time / ideas which is a complete shame.Could have been so much more but was just a wasted opportunity, if the original second world was wasn't spoiled by the totally silly ending.Rating 5 out of 10"
51,"As a WW2 amatuer historian, I was shocked to see an American paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne unit patch and directly below it the patch of The Big Red One. (The 1st Infantry Div.) I have never seen this before. If the soldier served in the 1st Inf. Div. prior to being assigned to the 82nd Abn. - that patch would be on the right shoulder. Whoever the technical advisor was - they should have been fired. That's all it took for me to stop watching this movie."
52,"Just saw this terrible film it's horrible and time waster film it's not worth watching after you finish this film, now I like idea of film in a world war II horror film style but with ghost I am like eh okay how would that work? if you want films like this I suggest to watch Overlord and Dog Soldiers but that's not world war II Dog Soldiers but at least they are soldiers fighting against evil werewolf's but with this film it lost soo much potential, the film is watchable to be honest you start to get into it then when you get to middle to end theirs twist witch I wont spoil but it was freaking stupid it was an backstage type like this film wannabe Westworld like you think it was western then it turns out to be SC-FI in modern day style like everything is backstage. fair out this shouldbeen a fully world war II of those lead characters going threw all this haunting nightmare situation and film ghosts of war like that doesn't work in world war II film that work in different films but like explame if you take Saving Private Ryan meets The Amityville Horror type but it doesn't fit idea I don't see world war II solders going threw haunting house with ghost I see more idea like if it's monsters or vampires or zombies just like with overlord that was in world war II with monsters in it that worked better but world war II in ghost film style with SC-FI type of style ruined when film went to the twist it felt like I was watching different film twist really ruined film it killed it. it's like making world war II film style of Saving Private Ryan mixed with Exorcist that would be an stupid idea for film. now story follows you have five American soldiers Chris (Brenton Thwaites), Kirk (Theo Rossi) known for Sons of Anarchy, Luke Cage upcoming army of dead Netflix film, Eugene (Skylar Astin) who really looks like Joseph Fiennes character in Enemy of gates did director watch that and said let's make him like that because Enemy of gates is World War II film Russians against Nazi's type I swear he looks like him type up Joseph Fiennes his character Commisar Danilov look them 2 up you can compare them you will be shocked wow. Tappert (Kyle Gallner), Butchie (Alan Ritchson) and also cameo actor Billy Zane is in it as well but not much in film he is their for paycheck that's it.American soldiers fighting war going threw battle, they walking to find place to stop by and take rest they found this huge mansion they stayed in then one night some of soldiers seeing and hearing ghost around house they are getting haunted by ghost, so entire film you find out everything what happened how house got haunted about family who got killed by Nazi's then entire film has it's potential in halfway film then after halfway it messed up everything you find out twist then it turns into different film it like if someone changes channel it's like I am watching different film ending was empty it lost soo much
too much of potential it's like end of day if you movies like this I suggest Overlord and Dog Soldiers or dead snow I know that's silly one but hey at least it's better then this film then to this crap this film is like you watch once you hate then you move on that's all it is this director only made 2 films 1st film he directed was Butterfly Effect that was like 2004 until then he never made film until now with this terrible crap film director Eric Bress hasn't created nothing in between now and then and hasn't learned how to create a good ending yet. that's why no one wanted to work with this director is because with this film you watch it's soo bad just like with this director could not write or direct i wonder why he has now made 2 films Interesting movie with a good amount of action and mystery. Good story with lots to expect but falls a bit short overall but Eric Bress screwed and messed up ending of film that's what made everyone got pissed off even me I am not only one here who is pissed off about this dump film There is no END, not even open ending. It just abruptly stops. Run out of ideas, no funding, no whatever.... it just stops. believe me you don't wanna be fooled with this film makes you think entire film is world war II film but it's not I am telling you this already theirs backstage twist of film that will hit you like stomach leave you with bad ending, stupid silly dumb twist plot of film stay away of this dumpster flick."
53,Most of the movie was well done but it seemed like the writers gave up on the ending or didn't know how to properly tie up loose ends so just decided to slap together some random events to end the movie. My biggest question is....why are the ghosts hunting the Americans when shouldn't they be hunting ISIS???
54,...and then it just continued. Enjoyable movie if you keep your expectations low.
55,"This was a good B-movie ghost story and then they torpedoed it with a twist that came out of nowhere. Not all movies need a twist. I think M. Night Shyamalan has single-handedly proven that.The story with the G.I.'s in the mansion was spooky and atmospheric. The acting was good. The direction, production and special effects were good enough. The script had a nice forward thrust. It seemed to be heading somewhere. Then, like someone jumping out in a clown suit, HERE COMES THE TWIST!!! So, they never solved the mystery of the mansion and we're thrown into a whole new movie I'm guessing most people didn't want to watch.A better use of the writer's time would've been writing an ending to the mansion story. That is the story the audience was invested in."
56,"As others have said, good for the first 2 acts and the third act is hot garbage and tbh actually a decent meme.Like i mean, how are there ghosts in the computer program? lmao wtf"
57,"So the summary of this was touted as a supernatural WWII period piece, which I thought sounded pretty cool.The first part was actually pretty good, but it went downhill as soon as they got to the chateau. Cliche spooky sounds, whispering, and apparitions began almost immediately, and the music felt forced and uninspired.It's like somebody wrote the first half of a pretty good screenplay, and then somebody else came along and attempted to write the second half based on no knowledge of what was previously written. A freaking computer simulation and a vaguely defined Muslim curse? Seriously?Look, I love bad horror movies, but this one made me feel like I wasted my time. I feel actual anger that I spent time on this movie. If this was a product that I bought outright, I'd return it for false advertising. There's a difference between a clever twist and just jumping the shark and lying to your audience.The acting itself was actually pretty good, to be fair. I'd watch an actual WWII movie with this same cast of soldiers."
58,"If you are looking for a good B Movie, this is a great option!
Enjoy it!
Ps: B movie okay! Lol"
59,"Acting atrocious, bad CGI, obvious voice dubbing, music badly levelled over talking and the script is boyish and immature. Gave up after 5 mins in. Better films made for less."
60,"Ghosts of War is the latest in the metaphor - War is Horror (literal and figurative) genre. This genre hasn't really found a champion to show it can be done well. Overlord may be the most successful to date. These films tend to be low budget, looking fake, and end up having some twist that mostly ruins the mood in the end.Ghosts of War unfortunately follows this template. We see a small team of soldiers in World War Two traveling to secure a mansion which hold strange (haunted) secrets. This feels much like the Haunting of Hill House, so initially there is good mood development. There is also a strong effort to create interesting characters - which does meet with some success, although it often falls into cliché. As it is a war movie, there is the required amount of gore as well, which is appropriately satisfying. So initially, we have some check marks.The problem of course, is once the initial mood and badies are established, something has to happen next, and this is where the film falls flat. There are no rules or clues that explain anything. Characters make inexplicably stupid choices. Things start to make less and less sense and the film quickly and totally flops into absurdity.So, ultimately, should you watch the film? There is enough here to warrant an hour and a 1/2 of your time. There are some creepy, fun moments, and there are a couple of solid scenes that deserve a better vehicle for them. The totality of the film is 6/10, but with the understanding that there are elements that really do fail this film."
61,"Really good movie with some creepy parts and good jumps. However the ending ruined the whole movie, why did they end it like that😩 the end was so dumb!!!!!"
62,"The actors are top notch, the story line took off like a bullet and grabbed my attention immediately for the first 45 minutes... But after the first hour, the story line took a different turn that dashed my hopes of a 'Kingesque' type story. Granted, the drama is never-ending, but it turns to a sci-fi, which is totally unexpected.
I would like to see more from this writer... I was not disappointed in the entertainment value of the movie and I would love to find more... I was shocked to see that Worldwide Gross for the film was an insulting $315,000, but I'm not really certain as to how profits for streaming movies really work out.
I like this film, and I am looking forward to more stories."
63,"I am not sure where to begin with this, but take note that I felt compelled to create an account just so I could post my first review ever in hope to give a clear picture of this film.The positive attribute of this movie is its originality. It decently connects war, horror and sci-fi in perhaps a new way (at least from my perspective). Some of the cinematography and costume design was well done. For this, the movie is awarded 2 stars.Aside for the above, the movie fails on all other levels. Despite what some reviewers suggest, the CGI, acting (as a whole) and plot were poorly done. Despite the movie's $13 million budget, most of the CGI look unrealistic (low budget effects). There was overacting that at times was shoddy/cheesy. The movie wanted to be too many things and because of it failed to succeed at anything. For its attempt in these areas, and in fairness, the movie is awarded another star.Some will suggest a late twist saves this movie and makes it something more than it is. I think not. The sub-5 star reviews are accurate on this one. In fact, this movie would be otherwise completely forgettable for not the overall poor execution and intriguingly absurd attempt to be something new.To summarize, originality doesn't save this movie. You can find better ways, and movies, to occupy 1.5 hours of your time. That said, if you go into it prepared with no expectations and with a desire to see how the 6-plus reviews are wrong, give it a go. At the very least you will likely find some enjoyment in your dislike for the movie as watch it through.Rating: 3/10"
64,I really think this movie will be lame at the very end when the story goes but totally out of my expectation. It's quite well planned and scary part is not tacky. Can watch.
65,"So bad, so so bad, so very very bad. Cheap ""scares"", bland formula, dumb plot. Kind of an insult to the Veterans who have PTSD and to movies who handle the subject much more appropriately."
66,"Ghosts are actually far more believable than the biggest wtf ending ever. The ghosts were actually scary, the acting was great and then it all went down the drain. In hindsight the clues were actually all there for the twist but the kicker is the last line is infuriating. SMH. This could have been a masterpiece."
67,I was very much enjoying this until the last 20 minutes when it got just stupid and political. I don't need to be preached to by a movie.
68,"This movie is brilliant. The idea is fresh and the acting is superb. Thoroughly enjoyed it and I am not a fan of horror movies. The ending, well I bileve it was the right one. Enjoy it."
69,"This was an interesting movie and with a better director that wasn't the one who wrote the script; probably would have worked better. There's a reason why the director only has 2 directing credits to his name 16yrs apart. In some ways this is like Cabin in the Woods but that was a far superior movie with a director that truly knew what he was doing with the script.
Some things will leave you wondering ""Is that it?"" Like Billy Zane being in the movie but has such a small part it leaves you already knowing he'll return somehow. The acting overall is fine but probably would have been more believable with someone who could properly bring out what is needed. Too many times these characters were just a slight different version of characters we've seen these actors play before. Alan Ritchson was wasted in this movie as he's such an underrated talent.
The ending of this movie I didn't see coming until it became obvious that there was more to this starting with the building.
Overall this movie is better than the critic score and the user score; just don't go in expecting much."
70,"Bloody and gory and minor scariness with a plot twist at the end which some will and some won't like. Seen a lot worse and at least they tried to do something different, whether it came off or not is each persons call."
71,"The acting is ok and the plot is pretty engaging up until near the end.. which I think is trying hard to be unique and mind-boogling, I guess, but failed."
72,It's an okay movie. The ending is weird. Just weird.
73,"So, this is a really good film with a decent storyline mostly all the way through. The acting, although clunky at time, is good and the effects are reasonable. The twists are good, and even as we hit the last 25 minutes I thought this was very interesting
and would have been a really great Saturday night B movie but, what happened? It's like it was time's up, everyone out of the studio now. Baffling, and spoiled it for so many and fir me"
74,"Well, when I sat down to watch ""Ghosts of War"", I must say that I wasn't particularly thrilled or excited. Why? Well, usually World War II movies and horror tend to not be an overly great combination. But still, I hadn't already seen this 2020 movie, much less actually heard about it, so of course I found the time to sit down and watch it.And color me impressed. This movie from writer and director Eric Bress was actually rather enjoyable and entertaining. Turns out that he really had managed to come up with a concept idea that proved interesting, albeit somewhat akin to what you have in the ""Assassin's Creed"" franchise, but still managing to combine the elements of classic traditional horror movie and the feel of a proper World War II movie into the mixture. And let me just say that the result was good.The storyline was rather interesting, especially because director Eric Bress manages to keep the audience in the dark throughout the entire course of the movie, speculating and guessing at what is really going on. And the twist to the story was very nicely molded into shape and brought into play.Visually then ""Ghosts of War"" definitely had that traditional World War II feeling to it, and that worked very well in favor of the movie, as it just set the perfect mood throughout the movie. And needless to say that the large house, in which most of the movie played out, actually also was quite the interesting touch to the movie, adding a good setting for the horror aspect.""Ghosts of War"" has an interesting and good ensemble of cast members, with the likes of Kyle Gallner and Billy Zane to mention the most familiar faces for me.The horror aspect to the storyline in ""Ghosts of War"" was adequate, but director Eric Bress does make use of a hefty amount of jump scares, which tends to grow tedious after a while. But it being a horror movie it is acceptable, just keep in mind that ""Ghosts of War"" is one such movie, and not a subtle horror story that creeps under your skin.I was definitely surprised with the outcome of ""Ghosts of War"" and how entertaining it actually turned out to be. So I was more than genuinely impressed and entertained with what I sat through. And I both can and will warmly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Ghosts of War"" if you get the chance to do so.My rating of ""Ghosts of War"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."
75,"The movie itself was good. A lot of jump scares and good characters. When it was getting more intense and interesting, they just wrapped up with movie with no explanation or anything whatsoever. Unless part 2 is out then sure make sense but not sure if there will be a sequel."
76,"People are ridiculous here, who complaining about the ending. The end made that movie something special. If they don't do it like that it is just another ghost movie like the other thousands... If you want to watch something special war movie I highly recommend this one."
77,"Good film ruined by
the ending.... Just why?!?
Good acting, effects, setting, lighting and the audio was very good.
Such a shame"
78,"I am trying to get out of the habit of reading reviews before watching a film, which is what I did with Ghosts of War. I probably wouldn't have bothered with it if I'd read up on it!Firstly, the film does have a frankly odd twist at the end. I don't think anyone could truly say 'I saw that coming'. Sadly, like others on here, it's the twist which makes me mark the film down to a 6/10. What's annoying is the end accounts for 20 odd minutes of the film. The other hour or so is actually quite good. The atmosphere, the setting and jump scenes all start to build up nicely. Then BOOM, you're hit with a total plot change.Despite the twist, I'd still say watch the film (a lot of people probably will just to find out what the ending is!) because it has decent enough acting and some good scenes. Just don't expect a classic horror."
79,"I didn't actually have a clue what this was about, it was in Netflix's top ten so I just went with it. It's definitely not your average war film lol. I could deal with it being supernatural, a bit odd but I was rolling with it. The twist at the end however, absolute madness. Are we just supposed to guess how it panned out - did he manage to save the rest of them?! I guess I'll never know lol. The only other time I was this disappointed was when I watched Open House!!"
80,"Movie was well paced, had good actors and interesting characters. Watching this in surround sound is also recommended.
I was really getting into the mystery of the movie then the twist came, then I was shocked and actually liked it even more!
I like a supernatural movie that can do something different, there's far too little of that happening these days.
I do agree that the ending was a bit of a downer, but doesn't take away from a well made and entertaining movie."
81,I was in engrossed at the end and i loved it. The ending caught me be surprise because i thought it would all be forgives out
82,"Good movie but ending made no sense at all.
May be they didn't want a typical Hollywood Horror ending but this was a joke.In the words of Linkin Park:I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end it doesn't even matter ..."
83,"Good film well made but huge gaff, teenage werewolf was made in 1957, a while after WW2 was done."
84,"Thoroughly recommend,not the greatest ghost film but not the worst,clever twist,well worth a watch."
85,"I found this to be a very enjoyable film and quite original, I also really like the theme of a ww2 horror although the ending was quite disappointing, due to it being left very open to cue a sequel, it had some good twists and reveals along the way."
86,"WW2 - An army unit of 5 men arrive to hold a mansion house which is apparently haunted.This starts off like many ghost stories with some edginess, a few spooks and jumpscares which give you hope for the rest of the film. However, in looking into the causes of the haunting, the film gets increasingly complicated and eventually goes off the deep end in a completely bonkers change in direction - silly, when it started so well."
87,"It starts off as a WW II horror film reminds me alot about Overload (2018), now the deeper things get in the film the more intense the events become for the protagonists (typical horror movie fashion) well it was in a position where it could only get better if only the genre didn't switch over to science fiction and left the film on a rather weirdly-silly cliffhanger with no guarantee of a sequel (not cool guys, not cool)."
88,"Entertaining film, not as bad as some of the reviews are making out. If you got nothing better to do it'll pass an evening. not sure what to make of the ending, certainly a twist i never saw coming.
but then I try bit to overthink things. i don't look for any deep meaning in a pop song written by a fifteen year old, and the plot of a film don't gotta be water tight for me to enjoy it.
And this film has lots of jump scares, which is what i watched it for."
89,Watch to the end type of movie a real twister..the spoilers in the title..🎬
90,"Centering a story around a group of soliders in WWII is no original thing, but add in a supernatural element, a cast of young familiar faces and some great special effects and you have a movie that's perfect for a Saturday night in. The film is set in 1944 and a group of five soldiers led by Chris (Brandon Thwaites) Butchie (Alan Richardson) Eugene (Skylar Astin) Kirk (Theo Rossi) and Tappert (Kyle Gallner) are all soldiers in Nazi occupied France during the second world war. They are in charge of guarding a chateau that seems abandoned, after they spend the night and supernatural events start happening, they are roped into a house that invades each part of their brain playing tricks and mind games to tear them apart.What really stood out in this movie is the cinematography. The house itself is beautifully detailed keeping with the style at the time. Having the mystery of something popping out from every dark corner of the space is something that Lorenzo Senatore absolutely nails in this film. While a lot of the scares are jump ones, this is something that has been overdone in these kinds of films in recent years, fortunately it feels fresh and the combination of the aesthetic of the house itself with the supernatural beings make for a winning combination. Director Eric Bress does a fantastic job of making you care about these 5 soldiers from the opening shot. As their journey evolves and things get stranger, your focus and attention is sorely on making sure that these 5 soldiers get out of this situation alive and solve the mystery that this chateau alludes to. While there are a lot of supernatural elements in the story, it really is a character driven story that explores the effects of war on young soldiers, especially those placed in foreign territory with little awareness of what is really happening in the bigger picture. While this is alluded to, it is never fully explored as the horror elements need to be implemented for the movie to live up to its name.Performance wise, it is obvious that this cast were chosen for their abilities and the chemistry they have together as a group plays a large role in allowing you to suspend your belief. Thwaites in particular commands the screen as the lead. While his backstory is not as detailed as the others, he plays a lot with his eyes expressing the shock, horror and curiosity throughout the story. Ritchson is typecast again as the loudmouth American and while he does play this role well, it was another character that didn't have much depth and could have had some more on-screen time to help this. Astin plays the nerdy smart guy and does actually really well in this role. His character is very philosophical and it really fleshes out his character. I would be remiss if I didn't mention Billy Zane who plays Dr. Engel, a crazed lunatic who is unafraid to pull the punches. Ghosts of War is the perfect film for a movie night at home. It has just enough frights to keep you on the edge of your seat that weave with a great story embedded in war and despair that make this a great choice for a night in. Packing in a star studded cast from your favourite TV shows and movies also helps you instantly feel at home with this movie. Ghosts of War is now available on Google Movies, Apple Movies and online digital video stores for rental and purchase. Review by Alaisdair Leith"
91,All the bad reviews are from disappointed viewers. I watched this expecting a horror war flick and it's mostly that. I loved the ending because I really fell for the twist. If you like sci fi then you will like this movie. I rated it a 9 to offset the low scores. It's a solid 8 imo. If sci fi is your favorite type of film then this wont disappoint.
92,"A Horror/War movie, WWII as well. Not many around at all and I've been craving a Horror/War movie since the last one I saw as a kid. The Movie was good. The story was not good and the ending was horrible. But the acting was great, especially Brenton Thwaites one of my favourite actors since SLiDE. Ratings for this
Jump Scares 1/10
Anxiety 0/10
Acting 9/10
Story 2/10
Was I scared: No
Notes: It didn't feel real, I didn't feel suck to the screen but some scenes were interesting.
After watching it: happy I watched it"
93,"Teen titans doing ww2/afg source code. ending was bit confusing.
and damn billy zane, i didnt recognize him at all, he had some plastic srgery or what."
94,"This is a horror mysterious and psychological wartime drama. there are slash and some gore, summary excecutions, and a hecklergun full of ominous creatures making life in the hall of heavens a purgatory into hell.its a film with extreme shift in pace, intensity and scare factor, youll might know what happens, but it scares out your fekalia because its so intense at times e.g doublescare and trpplescares. the acting are not so far above average, but the speciual effects in the haunted house are brilliant. productionwise its an ok film, couldve been some better soundwork but else its a ptsd.this is the most exciting and feel the ghostdevils claw in the neck-feeling the grumpy old man have had lately, its has some bernt and ernie does the tulipan twist in the end , but try to pretend, and im sure a sequel will come. its simple to say, its a recommend"
95,What the hell did i just watch. Seriously one of the dumbest movie twists ever which totally ruined the already bad film. Stay away from it!
96,Listen to the bad reviews I wish I did and not wasted the time watching this. This has to be the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. The idea could have been good but it wasn't.... very cheesy (Yawn) seen it all before scare tactics that just got worse and worse right up until to stupid ending that looked like some kids had made it.... Seriously don't waste you time on this its RUBBISH
97,"This attractive assemble cast of young men couldn't save this movie. Although this movie looks great, and has a creative ending, it falls flat. I see remnants of The Cabin and Overlord, but without any of the suspense or scares. This is one of those movies that's going to lure you in regardless of the reviews, and then let you down."
98,Whoever cast this movie should be barred from casting forever. The cast are meant to be soldiers but are so low T it hurts!!
99,What you think... it's not!We see soldiers hold up in a house attacked by Germans... then the hauntings begin.... or is it.But of a slow start but the last 10 minutes you think....whoa...not what I was expecting. This ending made me rethink the whole movie and also raised my scoring. Very clever!
100,What a waste of talent! Terrible film. Felt like I watched an extended episode of a terrible low budget syfy TV show.
101,Dross. 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back. Cliche-ridden garbage. Is my review long enough yet? On word would have sufficed.
102,"So, WWII soldiers find themselves in a haunted villa in Nazi occupied France. The plot moves quickly to the haunted elements, but this is so abrupt that none of these elements can establish any tone or mood. When they try to create character, the efforts are disjointed to the pace of the movie, leaving the characters just seeming weird. Then the ending. Avoiding any spoilers, the askew pace and connections in the film are somewhat answered in the end, but this just leaves the viewer without an answer. An interesting idea that is wasted by efforts to make a good looking film without having a clearer focus on what the intent was."
103,"THE Title and summary are misleading. This is a terrible ""C"" movie. Even with struggling to find things to watch I am sorry I watched this one. The worst story line, the acting was good with the awful material they had to work with. The ending is especially terrible. My recommendation skip this one. !"
104,"Good start but really bad end.
fist half scenes are good war atmosphere feeled by everone.
i cant understand why write the end like this."
105,"The things i pull out of my nose on a sunny Sunday afternoon are more interesting than this movie. Stay away, far far away."
106,"I went in blind. The twist at the end has been done before on a film with a different story line but i never would have guessed it.
5 soldiers in ww2 have to take refuge in an abandoned mansion and stop nazis from getting to them before their rescuers. But when they get in the house, they start to think its hauntes.
People are saying its awful but its not. The first 45 minutes has some good creepy bits in it. Theres 2 or 3 jump scares and the characters are a bit cliche' but it works. The whole time youre guessing and thinking ""do i know whats going on, or dont i?"".....but in a good way.If you like horrors and theres nothing else on, it passes the time without wasting any."
107,The movie ends VERY abruptly with no explanation what so ever to the story. It just ruins it.
108,"While I've read where the critics have ripped the timeline, and other factors, I was thoroughly impressed by this movie !! In fact; I can go so far as to say I've never seen one like it. There was an air of true creepinéss I haven't seen in a long time, and with horror being my true passion, and sheer amount of the genre watched speaks volumes !!
Kyle Gallners character Tappert is that of (what sounds like) a deeply Louisianaian accent. Although it's what he says about the actions of a soldier up for five straight day's, and what he did at one point, during this time that was his piece de resistance !! The Cats Cradle being the spoiler, and five moves in. While at other parts showing true grisly atrocities e.g. prying the teeth from dead Nazi's, and then tempering it by giving the gold, along with a trench coat, and a collarboard (or whatever you call the place on the neck of a soldier's uniform that show they're unique: like the lightning s's telling you they're Hitler's SS) so that the POW, presumably Jewish lady and son know they were taken from the hated Nazi's. A brilliant, and in my opinion, very touching show of kindness and empathy. From a soldier not long before scavaging the dead 😫
Brendan Thwaites play's the part of a born leader in this movie, and while Gallner was the only one I knew from many other movie's (A Haunting in Connecticut, Just before I Go, Beautiful Creatures, Water for Elephants) many of the other's were familiar (like Thwaites), and know I've seen in other film's. Anyway his character is the only one that is able to piece together what has truly happened, and at the end (*spoiler alert*) why they must return, and face the horrors once again !!
You see Billy Zane pop up more than once. Even though the credits say one character. You'll notice a Jerry that looks suspiciously like Zane !!
Meanwhile Eugene is the technical savvy character. Be it with the radio, translating multilingual journal's, playing the piano. All the way to preparing fondue for some hungry troops !! Even a place where Thwaites hears what he thinks is Morse code, and is, which Eugene (Skylar) writes down, as the letters are tapped out.
Butchie is the muscle, boxer, tough guy, redneck that wants to beat the biggest Nazi they face, or beat his brain's in with a nearby crowbar. Not much of a choice, and is a lose-lose proposition anyway !! He's also the biggest hero of the bunch, which is pointed out by one of the other's at a crucial moment.
I'm not giving much away, and certainly not the ghosts they must face, or the how/why there are two different elements !! I will say that it lives up to the title Ghosts in a big way. Drawing from more than one culture, which is explained during the movie.
I will say that those whom gave it a low rating may be, because they weren't intelligent enough to grasp what was going on. Instead picking on details like one I read about the time of year, and the march through Stuttgart 🙄 It's a ghost movie afterall, and how many actual real ghosts have you met ?? Don't focus on the wrong part of the story, as Joe Dirt might tell these bozos being supercritical of a fictional ghost story. Good grief !! With all of these Nuns, and spin-off movie's of Annabelle; give me a break !! Start it up, have your 🍿 ready, and enjoy a good show. Are there better ?? Naturally as there always will be. Can you name one fictional movie, and say with no dissension: This is the best movie ever made !! Of course not: so watch it, and post your own review 💯 🎥 💀 👻💂👮👀"
109,"All those given this movie positive reviews must be linked to the production somehow. It had potential, but it seems as if the filmmakers ran out of money and just stopped filming, then decided to put this garbage in the market. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME! There is absolutely nothing gained from watching this ill-conceived drivel."
110,"This had a lot going for it with the actors involved, but is just a complete turd. I mostly feel sorry for Billy Zane, as I just watched Dead Calm again recently. With so much going for it it's a complete letdown."
111,"I found this movie on Netflix and by the title assumed it was a war movie and didn't realize it was a thriller. First of all the way they filmed this movie is amazing, the sets seem so historically correct. The movie not only has some jump scares but as it plays out it keeps you guessing at every turn and is totally unpredictable. One of the best movies of 2020"
112,"Let me preface by saying I never write reviews. But that's how incredibly awful this movie was. The plot starts out intriguing, but boy did that go off the rails quickly. What the hell were the writers smoking? You think you're watching a World War 2 haunted house hybrid. Cool. Interesting concept. Then it jumps to the war in Afghanistan and becomes shockingly Islamaphobic. Honestly, I'm having trouble putting into words what I just watched. I would steer clear of this one."
113,"Red Herring: The Movie!Going into much detail about this movie would break lots of plot, but the end basically ruined it for me... in addition to ALL the red herring stuff throughout.Movie looks ok, special effects are ok, some of the story is ok, acting ranges from fine to decent. Typical and VERY ANNOYING jump scares were scattered throughout. There are a few very dumb, unanswered questions, such as: Why is the guy boxing ye olde style? Why did one of the ruck sacks get left behind by the soldiers they relieved? (After the ending, the list could go on, but these are both VERY early questions from the movie)The biggest movie this has is that there are tons of dead ends and, yes, red herrings in the movie could be chalked up to the ending of the movie, but many MANY more cannot. Dont bother paying TOO much attention to the small details or trying to figure out whats really going on because the EXTREMELY few actual hints are buried under a mountain of misdirection for misdirections sake.The ending is pretty awful. They did little to actually connect it to any part of the story. You could basically tack this ending onto any fiction movie, and it'll ruin those other stories as well. Which is a shame, as I was actually enjoying the story and wondering where it would go. At one point I accidentally saw how much time was left in the movie before the 'twist', and was wondering how they would pull off an ending that made sense and tied things together. The answer is: they did not.Had they given the ending to a script doctor, I'm sure it could have been salvaged into a fun WW2 ghost story, even if the general ending was kept, but allowing for a true ending to take place."
114,"This is one movie you definitely do not want to read the bad reviews before you decide whether to watch it or not. I'm normally one of those people who's just go by the majority of reviews and if the most of the reviews were bad than I wouldn't even waste my time, well not this time!This is a pretty decent movie if you're like me who's tired of all the lame old style haunting ghost stories, I was attracted to this movie trailer at first and thought that the visual and the casts are interesting, it has that stylish low budget looking to it which I normally like.Admittedly this movies had a few flaws, like the editing seems rush, as well as one too many cheap jump scares, but the story itself has a few unexpected turns, and that twist ending was what makes this movie stands out from the rest of run of the mill ghosts/war stories, perhaps that last part could have been better executed but it was a clever ending nonetheless that may even leads to Ghosts of War-Part 2?"
115,"I was a little unsure what to expect of this movie, because of the many bad reviews and a few which rated it medium to medium-good. After watching it last night I must say I very much enjoyed it, and I don't understand what all these people are whining about !! It has a good storyline, solid acting, a well-designed set, and technically it doesn't fall short at all. Regarding the ending? A nice twist, unexpected. Original and not too bad. As for the people who are unable to comprehend anything except a cliche black-and-white ending, please skip ahead and go watch a Marvel movie or something. A well-deserved 7 stars for Ghosts of War !!"
116,"Overambitious? Yes. Excessive concepts? Yes. Completely enjoyable? Yes!Not everything is designed to be scrutinised, dissected and critiqued to its dying breath. This movie is exciting, ominous, tense and, at times, intriguing and even confusing. That's good! I was glued to the screen and enjoyed the ride, twist and all."
117,"I thought it was a good film. Kept me watching the full 90 minutes. The acting was good, the story was good. As for the ending well i quite liked it. it's very rare i can watch a film and not to have already figured out how it is going to end before it actually ends. so I'm always pleased when this happens and I can tell you your most likely not going to see this ending coming. So I give 8/10 for originality."
118,Director is able to hide very subliminal messages in the movie narrative which keeps audience second guessing. Characters talking out of plot narrative completely sucks you in the movie. Which then is beautifully brought to a full circle adding value to the movie overall story.
119,Did anyone else notice that there is a scene at 34:13 that should be (I think) at 45:08. I mean really? I thought I'd fallen asleep for 10 minutes! Kind of spolied our enjoyment a bit! Very Haunting of Hill House-esk.
120,This is perhaps the most absurd and nonsensical movie I've ever watched.
121,"I find the Ed and Lorraine Warren movies boring, I find most movies explain too much and the pace is choppy to compensate.This movie would've fit in around the same time as House of Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts. Its will appeal people who miss that time of the horror genre.If you think that Nun/Doll/whiny-ass Warren's genre is good you'll be bored."
122,"One of the guys actually jumps out from behind cover onto a hand grenade to protect his teammates, need I say more? Utter garbage."
123,"I watched this low budget horror on Netflix and to be fair it was well made and with very good acting. It borrows in a few ways from The Woman in Black, but I'd recommend it. You won't be frightened by it. There are scares and jumps, and not the quiet quiet BANG types, they do build up. The way the actors portrayed their inner demons was the highlight of the film. While not the greatest, it's atmospheric and draws you right in."
124,"I don't get all the complaints about the ending of this movie, I personally enjoyed every bit of that! I say it's like Cabin in the Woods because of.... Well I better not say, but I think if you've seen both movies you know what I'm talking about. And the premise of a horror movie set during wartime? Brilliant! I loved it! I say 7/10, it's not a classic but still a good solid horror movie!"
125,Surprising twist at the end. A little jumpy in the middle but overall I thought it was solid.
126,This film had such potential but was totally ruined by a rubbish ending. To start off it was an atmospheric ghost story and we where really enjoying it then suddenly it changed and became absolute confusing trash. Why do directors ruin good films by trying to be so called artistic.
127,"A good film spoilt by a very poor finish, I couldn't believe it when the end credits came up."
128,"To be honest, I did not understand what this story meant. because there's piece of cut scenes. so I gave this 3 ratings. I'm so sorry for that"
129,"This movie is very smart , The same director of Butterfly Effect .you will have some potencial scares! Impressive final"
130,"There is no END, not even open ending.
It just abruptly stops. Run out of ideas, no funding, no whatever.... it just stops."
131,"Trailer is deceiving, but it supposed to be as the movie have a strong twist. I guess that everyone that said the movie have bad ending were expecting a horror movie placed in WWII timeline, as the trailer shows. This is not a horror movie, this is a science fiction movie. So, if you are a horror movie fan, yes, the ending will disappoint you. Someone said that the ending gives no explanation, but it does, just that it ends in a loop. Great acting and cinematography for the first part, the ending have a B movie feeling, but is far from being a bad movie. Give it a chance, expect the unexpected."
132,"Didn't knew much about this film and the story besides the trailer I saw a while back.I always liked horror/thriller movies set in WW2,and this one didn't completely disappoint.The cast is pretty decent as well as the overall acting.The story is the strongest element of this movie,it's a bit messy at the start but the ending explains a lot,and then it makes much more sense.Okay it's not the best wartime horror movie but it's not the worst either."
133,"This was a thoroughly enjoyable horror movie which could have been awesome if they just had a little more time/money. There were several scenes you could tell had been cut and put in the wrong order. But premise, acting and story was really good."
134,"With a decent cast and an interesting basic plot, this one had the potential to become something better. However, the story went down the drain towards the end.Some parts don't connect very well, the story overall doesn't completely make sense. If the movie had been edited properly and a few changes made here and there, especially toward the end, it could have been a very good movie.It was entertaining in parts, but overall it's a mediocre horror movie."
135,"I can not say a single positive thing about this movie. It is truly horrible.Everything about it is bad... bad acting, bad camera work, bad script, bad everything.I am not sure what the writer was trying to produce... was it a ghost story or was it a war story? It certainly was not both. It appeared to me as if the producer picked up some mixed pages of movie script off the floor of an amateur screen writer and bundled them together to make a movie.Don't bother with this movie. It is truly horrible and painful to watch."
136,If you are into racism and segregation then this is the movie for you ... a horrible weak plot based on Islamic religion being used for black magic .. without really reading anything about the religion or it's teachings ... it promotes an ignorant message it's a good thing it was released during the corona virus period .. horrible sales is all this horrible movie deserves...
137,"As with any adaptation of real historical events (WW2) into a horror fiction concept there's going to be liberties taken. Within the first 5 minutes of this film I can tell you there is so many holes to pick in the accuracy of this film. I will reserve judgement on the general watchability as a horror film, but without further adieu...
-the film hints that it is set in France from the shops in the town they walk through's signs being french. Yet they are greeted by pajama'd escaped prisoners, hinting at Holocaust survivors. This is unlikely at best given *most* camps were not in France and prisoners were moved as the allies pushed through France so wouldn't be set free yet.
-the soldiers are wearing helmet flashes for the 101st airborne, but unit patches for the 82nd airborne and for some inexplicable reason also patches for the 1st infantry regiment right below... this makes no sense whatsoever. In addition several soldiers rank patches are halfway down their sleeves.
-the size and composition of the unit makes no sense with a lieutenant leading 5 other ranks. A fire team or undersized squad. Lead by a platoon lead. It don't make sense.
their mission is strange by all definitions, move to and hold a inconsequential target for no real reason in under strength unit size.In conclusion, it's a horrible representation of history, it's a pretty horrible horror too with so many overdone tropes. They've forced a narrative on a historical time period and tried to make the best of it. In that sense the film is ok at best. At worst it's poorly researched and written."
138,"The movie is not realistic - I know it's a war movie, but really the first scene is too brutal to be true - 5 young men in their 20's behave as if they are seasoned criminals - was this real in WW2?"
139,"What a bounch of crap .....experienced Wermacht units would have made mince meat of five lonely virgin soldiers with light amunition....when I realise that Billy Zane was to come up later on as a supernatural entity I stopped watching...don,t waste your time....go and knock your wife/girlfriend/boyfriend/pet instead"
140,This film for me has a descent setup for WW2 and has a great cast. Starts off pretty decent with the usual kind of scares the plot starts to thicken and unravel giving us more of what happened in this house. The scenes seemed all nicely shot until about Three Quarters of the way through there was some jumpy editing. The last 15-20 minutes were ambitious and could have been amazing but it just seemed to end without the final explanation it kinda needed to wrap the story up.
141,"A Ww2/Supernatural Mix. Great. Really original and in some places terrifying and hard to watch because it's so scary.Great to see Theo Rossi (Sons Of Anarchy).
& The rest of the cast/characters of the 5 soldiers good also.
Then the twist.That was all a simulation of their time in afghan. No wonder the ghosts looked cgi'd etc. I was enjoying the World War Two stuff but if it links in ok I'll go with it...Then the ending.For some reason the ghosts shouldn't be there and there's a bug in the system. So the main character decides to go back into the loop and try to change things. Seems like his memory has gone again. Then it goes off.I'm left a little confused. A little robbed because I was enjoying the original story however I would accept the Afghan link but the ending didn't really sum it up.This film would've worked if it just stayed on the original ww2 plot however it also worked with the twist, I just feel the ending could have been more. Ended too easy and abruptly."
142,"Just watch it yourself.. You know how ""keyboard Warriors"" works these days, with all their stupid hateful comments right?"
143,"11/30/2020 Skip right past those bad reviews, your gonna like it. Plenty of tension and scares. Twisty storyline that you'll never figure out until it's revealed. Excellent actors, great movie. Watch for yourself and decide? Bon Appetit'"
144,"Netflix makes some great movies these days. As I was watching Ghosts of War it struck me the style (only the style mind you) was not unlike a recent Netflix horror movie I saw called Ritual. Both movies feature young men and an honest script. These are guys you can believe in, good characters not exaggerated for dramatic effect. Ghosts of War doesn't really follow a 'horror rule book', but then again it sort of does. It's hard to explain. At first there are some good jump scares, but really the whole thing is just plain spooky. The spookiness starts even before they get to the chateau, which is a brilliantly chosen location and spooky too. I know, big spooky mansion sounds run of the mill, but this movie is not following the bumped-off-one-by-one teen ghost flick formula. I suppose you might compare it to Overlord (2018), and it wouldn't be a stretch to suggest that if you enjoyed that movie you'll enjoy this one."
145,This is a refreshing horror film. Although it my seem like your typical generic jump scares type of flick. It's designed that way for a reason. Cinematography and acting is solid. I enjoyed this film very much and highly recommend to my fellow horror movie fans.
146,A very good movie I don't know why people don't like it
147,"Such a good movie! Don't read too many reviews, just watch it for yourself and pay close attention to all the details so you don't get confused and misunderstand. I thought it was pretty interesting and for sure entertaining. Worth a watch. Its a really interesting combination of horror (both ghost and war tragedy horror), action and mystery. Give it a chance!"
148,"I'll preface this with the fact that I watched this movie this morning while sewing, so maybe I missed a bit of visuals here and there, but I did get drawn in right away and I had to put down my work to watch properly many times. I don't get why this movie has so many bad reviews. I liked this movie, for the most part at least. I thought it was spooky. Gave me good classic haunted house vibes that I was looking for. I liked the premise. I didn't find the first half it overly gory or jump scare cheap. (I don't mind a few jump scares) I really appreciated that they jump right in with the haunting. Everyone picks up on what's going on right away, none of that frustrating drawn out gaslighting that often happens in this genre.***potential spoiler:
I don't like gore or torture porn, so I did slow fast forward through some parts ( I'm hyper sensitive) of the reveal when we find out what's really going on and I was a bit disappointed at first, but it didn't ruin the scares up to that point or the build up, for me. In the end I thought it was a neat concept. I didn't even hate the ending, like so many have said. I liked it and I knew Billy Zane would com back at one point!***No more potential spoilers:
I am relatively forgiving when it comes to horror movies though. But I liked it. I would watch it again. Sets were gorgeous, cinematography was good. Acting was relatively good, for the most part. The historical Costumes were accurate, and that's a big bonus in horror movies. (As a film costumer myself, I know how unbelievably hard it is to keep military costume details straight, there's so much conflicting info out there, so I can't speak on that despite working on many war shows). CGI wasn't terrible, to me, watching on my tv at home. Anyhow, It kept me guessing; which doesn't happen much. I tend to have it all figured out 10 minutes in. Not this time. Thumbs up."
149,"I enjoyed the storyline here - well the two or three storylines by the time we were done. Started out as a good mix of ghost and war, and that was good movie, and the conclusion was a good movie as well. Had a little issue with the part in between.Surprises can be good, but I think you should be able to say ""of course that's what's happening"" when they do. In this case, there's not anything that I can put my hands on that would have led me to the reveal, so it felt sudden and out of place. (Avoiding spoilers, I think people remember things as they experienced them, not as the monster versions of them.)I think the biggest specific issue I had was the main character's ability to internalize and process his situation after the reveal, and act with authority and direction after minutes. I didn't see that in the character before, and I know if I was in that situation, I'd still be saying ""wtf you sayin?"" Pretty big point in the movie, so not insignificant.With acting on par, but a few bits of potential re-writes at critical points of a generally satisfying story lingering, I get to a 7."
150,"Such an engrossing movie, great acting, wonderful cinematography, had me wondering what in the world is going to happen next."
151,"I don't get all these reviews that said they didn't understand the ending, seems pretty obvious.
First, Billy Zane I'd in this movie, so that should tell you it's not good.
A group of soldiers in ww2 are sent to guard a house where the nazis had murdered the residents. Upon arriving, the soldiers begin to encounter ghosts.
Throughout the movie, you see several hints something is right. In the end, it's revealed these soldiers are actually modern day soldiers, wounded in battle during a cia operation. They had been flown to a secret installation and placed into a simulation to extract the details of what happened and to deal with the trauma.
All the terrible things the nazis had done to the French family were actually done to a Afghan family by isis.
In fact, the movie explain everything to an annoyingly detailed level. In the end, the last soldier asked to be put back into the simulation to fight the curse the afghani family had placed on them for sitting by and watching them die.
Let's just give a shout out for how much modern technology has improved the radios since ww2! Lol"
152,While I was watching this I thought wow - great acting and what a great idea to have a haunted house in a WWII setting. I was thinking this might be the best ghost movie I've ever seen because of the setting and because they had a mystery they were trying to figure out. Then the ending showed up. At that point it all turned out to be a joke - on us the viewer. It's one of those 'it's all just a dream' plots. I hate those cheap cop out plots and that kind of cheap ending gets a 1 from me every time. All of a sudden the main character is trust into the future and Billy Zane is standing over him in a futuristic medical facility. WTF? What a let down.
153,"This movie gives you a taste of multiple genres and it's really interesting the way they are interwoven. The basic story is of a WW II squad assigned to a haunted mansion. So it starts out as a basic WW II movie, then moves to a horror movie, back to WW II, back to horror then things take interesting twists.Script was good, acting was good, camera work was good. If this is a B flick it overachieved and became an A flick. It's minus over the top stuff, sticks instead with the mind. Never gets to a level of suspense like you see built in 6th sense or the gritty war experience of say Saving Private Ryan. You never really get to connect to the characters either. The military advisor was the weakest link and I suspect it will throw most military out of suspense of disbelief as military protocol isn't even a suggestion. They wear uniforms and have weapons. Not really good period weapons either. I suspect they just didn't bother with a military advisor, of if they had one he slept through the whole project or was ignored. It was action mistakes, mistakes in military protocol that downgraded this a star or two for me.Overall well worth watching. It won't keep you up at night, but it does give you a thrill or two. Does make for a really interesting plot, so it's not like you are watching the same movie over and over again as is so normal for Hollywood movies today."
154,"2020 has been a lousy year for cinema, to say the least, and this film typifies that drop in quality. The dialogue, character development, acting, story progression, effects (everything!) are annoyingly cheap. F for no effort."
155,"Super into 90% of the movie...and then the ending. Why? A perfectly good movie when to hell in a hand basket. Swing and a miss, boys, swing and a miss."
156,"Worst, worst, worst..i mean near to the ending really cringey, the ghost look fine but the present time lookss... Gosh... Storyline looks ridiculous, eventhough it was just all of their dreams (this is spoiler, i warn you), but they could make it better almost all time i keep skipping to find something interesting, but no."
157,"I dont mind the twist. Thought the film was good, kept me in suspense and watching the screen and not my phone. The twist was interesting and I wanted to see where it went. Then it went nowhere. That last scene dropped it all the way down to 5. I hate movies with no proper ending, just a waste of my time"
158,"A good horror should leave you unable to put the light out when you go to bed.
This movie delivers that.
Plenty of ghouls & gore and a decent psycho undertone.Definitely worth seeing if you want to be scared."
159,Ok the ending was stupid but the rest was kinda cool tbh the idea is new and a good writer will def do a lot with it
160,"Lugers be drawn, it's time for another ww2 related horror movie. Following on from the likes of 'winter siege' , 'overlord' and 'outpost' comes 'ghosts of war' brought to you by the creator of 'the butterfly effect' so says the DVD case blurb. So what sets this shocker apart from its similarly themed contempories? Not a lot really, all have period accurate dialogue and set design, all successfully balance war movie thrills with horror chills and all are worth at least an hour and a half of your time. Sadly not all of them flag as badly as 'ghosts' does in the final third of its running time. For an hour or so Eric bress's Bulgaria filmed shocker effectively piles on the tension and cgi gore, it's only when he veers off on different narrative tangent, that the film loses its appeal. Though unlikely to be anyone's favourite genre movie of 2020, 'ghosts of war ' Still provides solid B movie entertainment."
161,This is one of the most ill conceived films ever. Everyone involved must be so embarrassed. It is a complete train wreck and the last half hour is laughably bad in every way imaginable.
162,"Director/production- 4;
Story- 8;
Cinematography - 5;
Acting - 6;
Makeup/FX - 5;
Sound - 8;
Music - 5;
Personal motivation - 7;
My average - 6With a better directing and bigger budget, this could be a real good film. The acting was decent. The final chapter of the movie surprised me real good. It only missed the tone like Stir of Echoes or What lies beneath."
163,"Overall i would recommend people to watch this film, i absolutely loved the first hour or so you don't want to take your eyes off the screen. i love the plot twist at the end the only thing i feel could've improved was adding more to the end, it ends abruptly and it's quite disappointing, overall a decent watch."
164,"From the title I was expecting a European reboot of the Korean ghost war movie, R-Point but I was to be disappointed.Ghosts of War basically uses every horror trope imaginable and shoehorns them into a Second World War format for extra cliche value. Everything from the creepy big abandoned house through to the creepy dolls, there isn't an over used horror reference too tired and worn to be included.The action is predictable, a couple of jumpy moments and I kind of got bored. There's very little creep value and I didn't care enough about any of the characters to be bothered about what happened to any of them.And then there's the ending. Without spoiling it too much I'll just say it repackages the ""and it was all a dream in the end"" idea into a concept so disconnected from the rest of the story it's barely watchable. In fact, if it wasn't for all the violence it could almost be a comedy.Not worth watching. Watch R-Point instead."
165,I wasn't ready for this film to melt down into such incomprehensible garbage especially as the first half was really pretty good! Awful waste of time and completely unsatisfying ending!
166,"I watched this last night and was really impressed by the imagination and skill that went into its making. I came on IMDB to see how it was received and wow, aren't there a lot of viewers that want their film to follow a familiar pattern!
As another reviewer said, probably too much has been said on here about the film's content, but it all makes sense if you're willing to hang on, pay attention and not get all indignant, feeling like the filmmaker has set out to make a ""fool"" of you (Jesus!!).
I won't say more, other than see it if you like a spooky story. It delivers more than 90% of the genre."
167,"Yet another film that depicts WW2 as an American conflict. Truth is they arrived 3 years late and took all the glory. Very inaccurate and portrays the conflict as walk in the park. Just a bunch of tools playing at being soldiers, no real platoon would act like this. No discipline or order that a proper military unit woukd have had."
168,This was a real pleasant surprise. Excellent acting. Good production value..some excellent effects..most importantly it actually is creepy and scary..... And a great twist that no one will have seen coming...so much better than cheap unwatchable rubbish masquerading as horror these days.. reminded me a little of the keep..an 80s horror
169,"Do not listen to any negative critics! This movie is a really good one.
I figured out half of the twist at the end before it revealed just, spotting small clues everywhere in the movie.
Still not sure about the last 1 minute of the movie to be honest. I think there is still a big mistake there, but regardless it is a decent movie. A perfect mixture of war, horror and Sci-fi genre. Just watch it and see for yourself!"
170,"On my first viewing I totally get why a lot of reviewers here bagged or trashed the ending as if it was rushed or the writer gave up and threw in the towel. But view it a second time and pay careful attention to all the details and hopefully you'll have an ""Aha"" moment.
Without giving too much away, pay attention to the first couple of minutes as it will make sense in the end and the underlying themes of hell & curses."
171,Really enjoyed this. Something entirely different.
172,"Really enjoyed the movie. I'm no movie critic but could hardly move through the whole thing. Ending made me a little ""WHAT??!!"" .Now googling to see if a 2nd movie coming out"
173,"If you actually watch the entire movie there's no goof, factual error or anachronism that can't be explained away. The entire cast could of rode off into the sunset on dragons if that's what the director and writer decided they wanted to do. Sure, the film is a little silly, you don't have to engage your brain to enjoy it, and, it's only worth watching once, but if you want to be entertained for a while and not have to concentrate, watch it. If you switch off half way through enraged about goofs and factual errors, don't bother to write a review or post here about the gaffs and goofs until you have watched the whole movie."
174,"A fun paranormal WWII film suddenly uprooted with a pointless ""it was all a dream ending"" with a pointless Sci-Fi twist that adds absolutely nothing to the film"
175,"Just when you think there is an interesting twist
""Ghosts of war "" Ok, we've run out of ideas, roll the credits"""
176,"Wow...what a steaming pile of crap. Very cheap scares, the kind done a million times. Trying to forcibly inject tension into the script that just did not work. And the silly twist at the end was not needed.....I would of had a touch more respect for the movie if they had of kept it as a straight forward ghost film."
177,"The first act sets up an interesting and engaging ghost / haunted house horror-thriller, with some great moments. The scene in the trailer, with the Jewish holocaust survivors, touching. The first few days in the house? Wild! Great acting, good ghost tension, subtle enough build up. Really really good.But then, in the second act, it feels like the writers went on strike, and a 13 year old who'd only ever 'read' Assassin's Creed was hired to finish the script.The plot holes that emerge could break space-time and swallow a star, let alone the absolute lack of resolution offered by the final scene (no joke, top 10 worst ending's of a film I've ever seen).Don't watch this film, watch anything else"
178,"Very disappointing, badly written and edited. If you want a decent war time horror film go and watch ""R-Point"""
179,"Ghosts Of War: Late 1944, five US soldiers are assigned to guard a chateau in North-Eastern France. They relieve a squad who are extremely eager to leave. It looks like a cushy billet but soon they hear strange noises, see apparitions, Knocking noises in Morse code give them warnings. Obscure messages over the radio seem vaguely threatening. They encounter poltergeist effects and find a pentagram on the floor. The nazis who previously held the chateau had carried out Occult Rituals. This is also a war film and they have to battle nazis. But even then there are supernatural events.The horrors of war as well as the activities of angry ghosts are well illustrated. Disturbing scenes of violence and jump scares occur throughout the movie. Good effects, levitation, ghosts, even the battle scenes. The dark castle is an ideal setting for this tale. There are also a few plot twists which I can't reveal here but the clues are there. Written and Directed by Eric Bress. On Netflix. 7/10."
180,"And I have a fairly good idea where we're going. A mention later of an Ambrose Bierce short story (one of my all time favourites) and I would put money on it.
Well acted and quite enjoyable but for everyone who thinks it takes off into a weird second act just haven't beeen paying attention."
181,"I was warned for the ending. Having seen only the scene where the soldiers sit and suddenly hear noises, I decided to give it a go. Very well mixing mystery, horror and action it was worth my time. I like Billly Zane and I feel he had potential to be a great actor but was wasted by playing the baddy in Titanic making everyone hate him.The last 10 min where they discover they are being treated for injuries in Afghanistan was a nice development to me. In mystery movies, explaining the mystery is always a double-edged sword, either you like it or not.Certainly the worst part for everybody was finishing the movie with Brenton Thwaites back in the beginning asking the shadow smoker what he wants. It really felt like they suddenly run out of film, or couldn't shoot more due to the pandemic, or that the writer didn't have any clue how to continue this.Well, my point of view is that this movie is like a virtual Groundhog Day, but we only get to see one day. The shadow smoker is the only real bad guy in the movie and is meant to be the ISIS leader who liked cigars and has thrown one on the sitting man. So to break the curse, Brenton will have to confront him in the virtual world (as he didn't in the reality). This is what haunts them all.Of course I would have liked another 20-30min showing the confrontation, but I suspect they left it open for next movie. Horror movies always leave a cliffhanger to the next. Will they do it? It's another thing. There is a big chance that if they do, it will be not as good as the first one. So, maybe leave as it is would be ok. So the movie had to be cut there"
182,"The film started off quite well and looked to be really exciting and gory.The killings and the fight were excellent as well. It was quite enjoyable up to the last 10 minutes when it was a total hotch-potch of p00, I'm afraid.I mean, what was the writer thinking of? It was a complete load of **** that just ruined it.Unbelievable that they thought this would work... It didn't!I gave it a 4 for and excellent first part of the film and an awful ridiculous and laughable ending."

184,"If you love WW2 horror-themed films like The Bunker, The Outpost, Deathwatch, or R-point - you will enjoy this one.
What makes this one special is its weirdness, there's so much stuff packed into 90 minutes and the ending just blows up in your face, figuratively and literally :D
It's really hard to describe this film. While viewing I was trying to figure out why is the horror element in this so in-your-face, and as it turns out, this wasn't really a horror film.
For all the flaws it has, it turned out to be quite entertaining just due to its bizarre structure and story. If you love the subgenre and the films I've mentioned above - check it out without knowing anything about it"
185,"Ok, it got good horror that kept building up, till it got ruined with that stupid ending that didn't make any sense"
186,"Boy, this movie is a massive flop and gets worse by the minute! It's a total mash up of several movie genres... and in the end, it's none of them. It mixes war, horror, thriller, action, sci-fi but it won't really pick a side. Writer probably had a multiple personality disorder and tried to turn his illness into a movie.
Poor fx, poor acting, poor story. Only managed to watch till the end because I don't like to let things unfinished... just like people feel bad for leaving food scraps on a dish.
The shoot out sequence is by far the worst moment.
If you want to waste 2 hours out of your life, just watch this movie."
187,"This is how movies end now! I enjoyed it! The twist was great, did not see it coming!
Movies lately are open to interpretation, which I like, it paid off on rhis type if movie.. editing was pretty bad near the start, but they were in a simulation so....."
188,"Movie started of good! Nice concept on the beginning..... terrible ending. When the ""polt twist"" was revealed it was their crash and burn!"
189,I hear a lot of reviewers moaning about the ending and whilst yes it did feel a bit rushed for a low budget war horror movie it does the job and I thoroughly enjoyed it even though the plot was borrowed from Source Code.The acting was good and the horror was low key but done within the budget and although the editing seems a bit haphazard the film itself comes together quite well and delivers a much better horror than most of the terrible offerings out there so it gets a solid 7/10 from me!
190,"Possible tiny spoiler Good acting well above the average on all for the movie.
Appreciate what I was trying to do.
But tired of that ending, wish it would show an ending were the really bad guys experience horror."
191,"Five American soldiers - Brenton Thwaites from DC's Titans, Theo Rossi from Sons of Anarchy, Skylar Astin from Pitch Perfect, Kyle Gallner from The Haunting in Connecticut, and Alan Ritchson Raphael from both Ninja Turtles - are assigned to guard a French mansion near the end of World War II, formerly occupied by the Nazi high command, where they had massacred the family that lived there. The situation quickly descends into madness when they encounter a supernatural enemy seeking revenge, far more terrifying than anything seen on the battlefield.
It is known that if there are themes that always fit well, they are ghosts and WW2, so combined they could work well, half in the Overlord Movie line and without the satire of Dead snow and his zombie nazis. If we add to that the script and direction of The Butterfly Effect, Eric Bress (who also scripted two of the Final Destination (Movie)), an ominous staging, a couple of jumps with screaming ghosts all at once, results in something more or less worthy, which in just over an hour and a half entertains. Ultimately the thing starts half Saving Private Ryan and ends House on Haunted Hill. Now the end is something else, I do not advance so that it does not lose effect if they wanted to see it, it did not bother me in itself, what if it does not convince me is that it is half as if there is no resolution, it seems an episode of series that we have to wait until next week to see how it ends. But well, taking that out is not bad.
At the end appears the come down Billy Zane who also goes as producer. Cast peculiarities, Thwaites and Ritchson work together on DC's Titans, one as Robin-Nightwing and the other as Hawk."
192,"It's pretty fresh to have a military horror film! The scares are effective, and the plot is engaging. The ending twist is unexpected too. I liked it a lot."
193,A good old fashioned horror. Really enjoyed it. Couldn't hear some of the talking as it was very muffled but that aside it's a good story and an interesting twist at the end. Didn't love the end. It could have been done better. But I got it. It just needed tweaked. Don't know what people didn't understand about the end. It made sense. Give it a go.
194,"Coulda woulda shoulda been a good movie but it all happened so fast and you are trying to figure it out, and it was easy to have theories about what was happening with the haunting. There were parts that seemed to be thrown in there that were just off the edge...then it just went off the grid in a really bad direction! Didn't work enough to explain why they were where they were (no spoilers here) at the end end, it really end, then it just ended! And that was that."
195,"Ghosts of War was directed and written by Eric Bress and stars Brenton Thwaites, Theo Rossi, Kyle Gallner, Skylar Astin, Alan Ritchson, Billy Zane, and Shaun Toub. It follows five American soldiers in WWII who are assigned to hold a French chateau. While initially a respite from combat, the place proves to be more terrifying than the battlefield.Plotting is familiar, with the haunted house formula being dressed in a World War II appearance. While it is well-trodden, it still allows for some good moments. On the way to an outpost, a squad of five American soldiers: Chris, Kirk, Tappert, Eugene, and Butchie (Thwaites, Rossi, Gallner, Astin, and Ritchson) blow up a German jeep with Major/Dr. Engel (Zane) among the group. Upon their arrival to relieve the soldiers already stationed there, they notice that the other soldiers are acting odd and in a hurry to leave. During the night strange things start to occur such as Morse code being tapped to the soldiers, and paintings changing. The soldiers are rushed by Germans and after their assault, they realize that they are experiencing everything the family that lived in the chateau did prior to their deaths. Soon they discover that they cannot leave until they solve a mystery.Characters are a mixed bag here. Chris never gets much of a personality from the script, leaving the character left to command the others without any presence or sense of authority. Kirk is alright, having the sort of scared quippy attitude that can permeate through a stressful situation. Other than that he is a New Yorker through and through. Tappert is the most interesting of the bunch; he has a lot of anger inside of him, covered by fear and regret. He is a quiet country man who is brutally effective at his job. Eugene is solid too, with a tepidness about him that makes him the most endearing. Although, he does know a lot about the mysteries presented, making him half character, half exposition dumper. Butchie is a nothing character. Performances are solid, Rossi, Gallner, and Astin all nail their characters and act believably scared. Thwaites is the odd one out here, his performance itself is good while trying to pin down a character and a personality that the script does not provide him. Ritchson sucks.Horror is better presented than some of the characters, but it still has its issues. The movie has a lot of creepy elements, such as the aforementioned Morse code scenes, a short bit involving the flickering of a lighter, recurring refugees, and the scene where the German soldiers attack the building conjures up some excellent suspense. However, for as many good scares as there are, there are a hefty amount of cheap ones too. Jumpscares exist throughout the movie, with some of them even being fake-outs where the character that the imagery is by does not see the scare. It is solely for startling the audience. While some of the jumpscares make sense in context, it does not make them any less lazy.Mechanically the movie is great. The locations are beautiful to look at, handsomely shot, and well dressed. It is fantastic work from the production designers. While some CGI exists, most of it is tolerable and having to do with the ghosts which works for and against the movie, making them look otherworldly, yet unbelievable. Practical effects are here too, and all of them look convincing, almost too much so, being horrifying. Again: great stuff. A twist does come into play around the 1 hour and 15 minute mark which is entirely unnecessary and, while it makes sense, does not elevate the film in any way. It was already good and the twist stifles the impact to a degree.Ghosts of War is a solid (and long awaited, for me anyway) second feature from Eric Bress. For the time that the twist does not exist in the movie, it is great; serving up solid scares, believable characters, and palpable atmosphere. However, the twist takes the movie down a notch. But the end result is still very enjoyable. Don't keep us waiting for the next movie Mr. Bress.68/100"
196,An unpredictable story and its worth watching.......

198,Thought this was a horror 2nd world war movie YES IT WAS ? But not great movie great acting great story ending BRILLIANT hope they make a sequel to finish off GREAT MOVIE
199,"Is it a war film, a horror film, a supernatural film, mystery film, a time travel film or a comedy? You decide but suffice to say they were dead all the time!"
