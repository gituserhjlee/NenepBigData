The cast is very funny especially Emma Stone and Nicolas Cage even though their characters weren't developed from the first one but they still very charming. The story is very simple as expected from a DreamWorks movie but the well designed action and the chemistry between the characters were good enough to keep you invested. I had so much fun watching this movie with my family I recommend watching it on a big screen if you can't catch it in the theater"
1,I absolutely loved it and so did my kids!! Would definitely recommend it and know we'll be purchasing once it's available.

Summary:Like Disney, DreamWorks is not shy to really bring animation A game to their movies, and this film is no exception. The Croods may not look the most realistic or revolutionary, but dang do they still move fluidly during the adventure of facing the elements of the wild, primitive stone age. Much like the first installment, the design of the world is beautiful, vivid colors filling much of the landscape that energizes the audience members, but not being afraid to fall into dark, drabber color and shadows to make foreboding landscapes meant to scare our ""heroes"" away. The whole design of the world maintains its cleverness as well, fusing various beasts together into forms that are humorous, fun, functional, and deadly all at the same time. As we reach the modern age, the clever devolution of our technology is hysterical to watch, not only in how it fits in the stone age's devices, but more so how the characters react to it in a sort of poke to our own traditions. This ingenuity is used well on multiple facets of this movie as story, design, and humor all maintain creative execution of the writer's talents. And yet that is not all this movie has to offer.
As I said earlier, animated features have a great potential to span all horizons, and the Croods takes that potential and balances it well. A deeper story lies beneath the comedic antics as themes of growing up, letting go, elitism, and several other themes are all addressed in the writing of this film. While not every character gets the same amount of growth, Crawford and his team managed to involve many people in uncovering the desires, truth, and weaknesses that were still present at the end of the first film. It takes the growth and continues to push helping our characters push to evolve into something more without taking too many steps back. That deeper side comes from good voice acting, the ensemble once more pulling their voices to match the emotions of the scene and characters without overstepping the boundaries too much. And even better is that so many of the characters have adequate time in the story and serve their purposes across the board, though some of the pets and accessories could have had some more time. Assuming they understood the importance of all their pieces, I was impressed to see the characters remain integrated, and not just included for the sake of being included a site that as I stated in the past is difficult to achieve.
Yet if you are worried all this multitiered approaches and deeper meaning make the movie less fun, you have nothing to worry about. Croods is still the same fun adventure that we saw back in the day, a blend of kid savvy stupidity that will bring out laughs, while also being just a fun vacation from reality with jokes that parents will get. Though it does still go a little far for my tastes, the movie just has that positivity that I always like to see, even at the darker parts, that make going to the movies the added flavor it needed. And as for the music, again, another piece to the puzzle that adds that tiny something that you did not realize you needed. Though no amazing chart topper or moving symphony piece, Croods 2 soundtrack is all about bringing out that same flair of fun that much of the movie is about, and using some other tricks for the more serious moments thereby adding to the scenes.Finding dislikes was hard and perhaps a bit picky when it comes to most audience members going to see the movie, but nevertheless here we go. The first part is that though they did a nice job with keeping balance and the pieces moving, there was more room to dive into the character's story. Guy's parents and the adventures they had to connect to Dawn would have been nice, or perhaps more into Eep and the Betterman's personal interactions the way we saw Guy's integration would have been preferred for the full effect. Even without adding new content, a few of the impasses could have used a bit more development to fully maximize the moments. In addition, the awesome opening action scenes that were dynamic and fun, sort of got diluted at the final climax where after much buildup of about 10 minutes of dialogue, I expected more of the same clever antics the beginning showed. Instead, it was more one shot uses of some character's new names that quickly fell to background for our main protagonists to take center stage again. Certainly not the worst, but after such great things during the rest of the movie, to stumble at the end was a bit of a letdown for me. I supposed it could be budget, timing, or ""violence"", but I also feel the political component of the film started coming into play more into the decision making. Despite all the hoping, Croods was not completely sheltered from the movements of the modern age and though not the most aggressive (Black Christmas and New Charlie's Angels) it still had no troubles sneaking its own voice in. Again, had the ending scene shown me the buildup was worth it great, but the demotion of three of the characters to forms that were weaker and outside of their character, could have done with a little better balance. Still not the worst and will most likely affect few people.The VERDICT:Despite my concerns of 2020 and sequel syndrome hitting, the second installment of the Croods was just as fun and energizing as its predecessor. With the same fluid design and fun chemistry, an amazing use of clever planning that blended story and fun, and a humorous atmosphere throughout the whole film, it is certainly worth a visit to check this out. Sure there are some picky things I would have liked to see, but overall, the movie is one of the better animated sequels I have seen in a long time. Are their scary parts for kids, sure as there are loud sounds and some darker designs that might creep them out, but overall it's a pretty safe kids film for those probably 6 and up, and for braver 3 year old's and up. Overall, I was very happy with the film and encourage families to check it out when they have the time.My scores are:Animation/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.5"
3,Wasn't as good as the original but was very close. Liked a lot and almost all of the jokes were hilarious. The entire cast is really good in there roles. Only critique is that I thought some of the jokes went on a little too long and some parts of the movie tried too hard to be comedic. But the kids wouldn't mind/notice. Overall good movie.
4,"Our kids loved it, and we couldn't stop laughing. Honestly, even better than the first one. The jokes were fabulous and the storyline was awesome! New favourite for sure."
5,"We were lucky enough to be able to preview the movie and we absolutely LOVED it!It was just as good - if not better - than the original.This time around, another family is introduced....A very sheltered human family named The Bettermans.This action-oriented flick is the perfect for the whole family! Unlike some other animated films, this one kept our attention as parents.My favorite was the wildcat Gran. There is also a pretty hilarious scene involving a chicken that you won't want to miss."
6,"The wondering cave family is back, this time find refuge with another family named the Bettermans, who are from Guys past, and while living in such luxury, but things are not has simply has it looks.The animation is so beyond amazing, and the comedy never let's up, almost like a sitcom. The voice talents of Nicolas Cage, Peter Dinklage, and Emma Stone to name a few is always fun. This sequel is a fun time, and will get your mind off of covid."
7,"The bad
This movie is too packed and can feel slow at some time they stuffed too much into it and it just doesn't feel right at some points and even gets boring but it's still a good film for young children
Some of the jokes fall flat during the movie
Some of the running gags go on for way longer than they should and it gets annoying
The movie can feel a little bit predictable at sometimes
The mixed reactions
The relationship between the croods and the new characters
The whole plot about the punch monkeys
The ending and everything about it
The good
The animation in this movie is beautiful and the world is is amazing it does a great job of continuing the story
The character development is even more amazing we get so much orange story between the characters we get a realization for some of the characters the whole thunder plot is amazing and the world just keeps going stronger
The story
this is the only natural way to go and I think they did a great job at delivering it
Other stuff
Especially since there was a lot of stuff in this movie and the ending I'm not sure how it can continue and I'm not sure how I feel about that
Overall
The movie is good but just like almost every other movie it is not perfect overall I give it a 83%. Not amazing but good a b-"
8,"I saw ""The Croods:A New Age"", starring the voices of Nicolas Cage-the Ghost Rider movies, The Weather Man; Emma Stone-La La Land, Superbad; Ryan Reynolds-The Hitman's Bodyguard, Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle and Peter Dinklage-Game of Thrones_tv, Elf.
This is a sequel to the 2013 'The Croods' that I liked better than the first one. Don't get me wrong, the first one was good but this one was even better. Nicolas returns as the head of the Croods, a prehistoric family that has adopted Ryan-Ryan is sort of like the next step up in the human evolutionary scale-and they are just looking for a new place to set up a home for the family, or as Nicolas calls them, his tribe. Ryan likes Emma, Nicolas' daughter. In their search, they come across a family that knew Ryan when he was younger and their names are the Bettermans-and they seem to think that they really are the better men. Peter is Phil Betterman, the father of the family and he thinks Ryan should stay with their family, the Bettermans, instead of the Croods-he thinks the Croods are beneath them and are mere savages. There are lots of class differences between the 2 families and it takes some time until they can agree on things. It is a funny and never dull story that has some subliminal messages, but not too many that would make it preachy. If you liked the first one then you should enjoy this one, too, because it is a great family film.
It's rated ""PG"" for peril, action and some rude humor and has a running time of 1 hour & 35 minutes.
I-and the rest of my group-really enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu_Ray."
9,"I liked the movie, I thought it was funny and has humor in it that everyone of all ages can enjoy, just an overall good movie. The plot is good and not confusing. I would rate it an 8/10 but there was just a lot of forced humor and it was kind of strange at the end. The story line was a little off from the first movie but I think that is fine because it was just little things. Definitely not as good as the first movie just because the end almost ruined the whole movie for me, it was extremely cheesy, but that is just my opinion, I am sure that if I were a child I would say differently.I liked the humor in this film, I was laughing pretty much the whole way through it. I liked the plot and how the Bettermans and the Croods have to eventually work as a team. I liked some of the modern references and how they took modern stuff and old caveman stuff and combined it to make an excellent movie.I couldn't emphasize this more, the end was very strange. I liked everything else about the movie though. I was an overall good family movie."
10,"IN A NUTSHELL:
This colorful sequel to the fun animation adventure The Croods is now available in theaters after being put on hold in 2016 by Universal Pictures. It's actually the longest we all have had to wait for a DreamWorks Animation sequel, seven-and-a-half years! It's Joel Crawford's directorial debut.
It's great family fun with enough humor that will make viewers of all ages laugh out loud. In a Covid world, this is a delightful distraction.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Shirtless men (animated)
Low-cut dresses are worn by girls and women (animated)
People and creatures in perilous situations.
Someone says, ""What the eff?!""
Name-calling
Lots of punching
There's a scene where a person yells obscenities, but the words are covered up with other sounds. When that happens, another person breaks the fourth wall and says to the camera, ""This movie's for older kids."" ha haTHEMES:
""Follow the light and you'll find tomorrow."" - Ugga (Catherine Keener)
""The pack stays together."" - Eep (Emma Stone)
Jealousy and competition
Teamwork
Family togetherness
Stronger together
Courage
Female empowerment (you'll learn about the Thunder Sisters)
Change can be a good thingTHINGS I LIKED:
The voice talents of the cast are really great. For starters, Ryan Reynolds voices ""Guy"", Eep's new love interest.
A lot of Millennials and GenZer's make fun of Nicolas Cage, but they would have to admit that he does a great job voicing the prehistoric dad, Grug, in the movie. This is his 100th film credit!
I've loved Cloris Leachman for years, so it's such a pleasure to see her...or in this case, hear her voice the character of Gran. Can you believe she's 94 years old? That's amazing!
Leslie Mann's voice is just so doggone sweet. Be on the lookout for her in an upcoming movie in 2021 called, ""Blithe Spirit."" I'll be posting my review of it in a few weeks.
Other fun voices include those by Peter Dinklage, Emma Stone, and Kelly Marie Tran.
So many cute visual and spoken gags.
Totally adorable sloth sidekick. Seatbelt mode. ha ha
Hearing the two new girlfriends squeal with delight at 100 decibels was hilarious.
Lots of fun new creatures and characters.
Man cave...ha ha Land-sharks. ha ha
Rapid-fire, non-stop action.
A few Mad Max: Fury Road Easter eggs for adults.
There's an insightful discussion about the scars we see from our pain and the internal wounds we can't see.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
If you didn't see the first movie or forgot what happened, there isn't a quick recap to get you up to speed. Not to worry. This movie can be enjoyed without seeing the first movie or knowing any backstories.
So much frenzied action. I wanted to see things slow down a bit so I could really see what was happening and enjoy everything in each frame.
Like so many Hollywood movies, men are shown as incompetent fools.
It's cute and fun, although a lot of critics are saying it's not fresh and original enough for people to get really excited about.
The tone of Act 3 is very different from the others.You can see the rest of my review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel or website."
11,"This movie is funny, enjoyable, and fun to watch. I highly recommend watching this movie with your entire family."
12,"(3.5 out of 5 stars).The Croods is a pretty fair family adventure film. Following the Croods next adventure as they are trying to find there forever tomorrow home which they call it. But when they come across a giant walled utopia. With food everywhere. And an oasis river. They run into another family that calls themselves the Bettermans family. Which they know Guy (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) family before they passed away. The Bettermans try to have Guy fall for there daughter while Grug (Nicholas Cage) makes a deal with them since he is disliking the idea his daughter Eve wants to start a life with Guy. While the Bettermans are holding a secret about there perfect home.The plot is pretty decent. The Croods are living a different lifestyle with the Bettermans. While they are trying to handle the Croods lifestyle. Grug is having trouble letting go his daughter is growing up. The story is not as strong as the original but still fun for the whole family.The animation, visuals, and soundtrack are fun. And good. The direction with Croods mother and Eve and grandmother teaming with Bettermans mother and daughter to go save the guys was a little cheesy as it tries for that punk rock star tone. The humor is fun. The animation is colorful. And plenty of adventurous action."
13,I am delighted from movie and so again to seen a movie always
14,"Lacked the originality and wittiness from the first one. The writers just plugged the characters from the croods into a formula that makes money but has been seen hundreds of times. The movie just got so weird so fast, the characters were just too much. They had 7 years to make a sequel to an amazing movie and they just ruined it."
15,"I enjoyed this sequel. It has some funny moments. I like the fact that teamwork was emphasized, as well as learning from each other's culture--Mrs. Betterman benefitting from cuddling with the pack while sleeping, Betterman daughter taking risks and having an adventure outside the wall, and the Croods benefitting from the Bettermans's technology, hygiene, etc.I guess the only critique I have is the second half. Lacks originality. The giant King Kong-esque villain has to be fed, else he will wreak havoc. This is the main storyline of How To Train Your Dragon Part 1.However, there are some original themes I've never seen before, such the punch-monkeys, as they communicate by punching each other's faces. That's pretty funny.Overall, good film for the family."
16,"I didn't go into this movie with a lot of expectations. Most sequels are pale imitations of the original, especially 'family' movies. This was a very pleasant surprise. The characters were all true to their originals. The story was engaging, though admittedly not tremendously original. Performances were good. Animation was on level with the original. Many parts were laugh out loud funny.If you enjoyed the original Croods movie, then I think you will find a lot of enjoy here has well."
17,I'm Glad That I Watched The Movie And That's It But There's No Spoilers So Yeah That's It
18,What a funny and relatable movie about family relationships! This movie stepped it up from the original. My first grader to my dad enjoyed this wonderfully animated film! Thank you for releasing this film and giving us a great family fun night! My only regret was not watching it sooner!
19,"The Croods: New Age is sensational because of the clever and colorful graphics, funny and realistic conflicts. The storyline is about the Bettermens not liking the Croods. They must learn how to get along with one another and they have many adventurous life lessons along the way.I like the story line because it's relatable to real life. The family conflicts and differences make the movie unpredictable. The characters are well developed. The production is state of the art. It is highly colorful and engaging from start to finish. The film is a great follow-up to the first one. My favorite part is when the main characters, Phil Betterment and Grug, are in the Jacuzzi.The message in the film is that we do not have to look the same and we all have far more in common than we realize. It's okay to look different.I give The Croods: New Age 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 4 to 12.
Reviewed by Bailey Rae F., KIDS FIRST!"
20,"While I really enjoyed the first Croods movie, the 2nd movie had a much funnier dialogue that lasted through out the entire movie. This happened without sacrificing the storyline. Sequals are rarely better, but this one was."
21,"The Croods: A New Age is a best movie I've watched in 2020. The story was great, Great comedy, the animation was fantastic and the cast did a perfect job at dubbing especially Emma Stone and Kelly Marie Tran. I loved this movie. I want everyone who is reading my review to watch this movie. This is great for kids and as well as adults. This movie is even better than the first one. So everyone WATCH THIS MOVIE !!!!!"
22,Okay so this is a good example of something we need in this day and time it's hilarious family friendly and beautiful it shows holidays are about more than just family but friends as well the humors funny the story moves fast and besides some things I think this is perfect for holidays the plot does resolve around sacrifice just a heads up
23,"So I went into this movie thinking it'd be fun based off of the trailers but my god, I was never expecting this. For some backstory, I didn't really like the original Croods to much so I wasn't expecting to much from this movie. I absolutely love this movie, everything about it made me incredibly happy. I've thought on it for a while and I can't really think of many, if any, negatives about the movie. I'm gonna leave it at, probably one of my favorite animated movies of all time and maybe even favorite movies. I definitely recommend."
24,"Enjoyed it but it's a typical Hollywood movie. It makes men look like incapable idiots who constantly screw up and never get anything right.Jokes were great and funny for all ages. Animation and characters were good. Kids loved it,"
