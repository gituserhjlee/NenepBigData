0,"If only they had added ""I have a particular set of skills..."" it might have been better.Netflix advertises this film well showing Fabrizio Gifuni as a tough, no nonsense, 'get the job done' ex-military father who is central to the movie. Sadly though, the film didn't meet the hope or expectations I had for it.The good and the bad:
When the end graphic 'La Belva' (The Beast) is better than the movie, you know something went wrong.From a broad view the story is fine, even if it has been told many times: A young family member is kidnapped leaving the father to get them back.Fabrizio Gifuni almost looks the part, grizzled with an over the top beard. However, for a man who supposedly spent 30 years in special forces he is a scrawnyStemming from the last point, the only relevance I can see in learning he was in special forces for 30 years was to give the impression he has a 'particular set of skills which make men like him dangerous to people who might kidnap his daughter'. However, he doesn't display any more skill than a determined father who can handle himself.The film fails to develop the characters leaving the viewer not caring much for them. For example, we don't learn much about the young girl who is kidnapped other than her big brother leaves her eating chips at a table where, predictably, it all goes wrong.Typical to the Italian stereotype, the film has great hype but no substance.The negatives could go on, but it would be like shooting fish in a barrel (i.e. easy).La Belva (2020) is not a film I will remember, and much like Sabotage (2014) this review will be the only reminder I once saw it."
1,"Yes this movie is formulaic, but that's not what bothered me. Am I to believe that a 30 year veteran of the special forces is really going to be that bad at fighting? And also to show up unarmed (not even a knife?) to the compound full of criminals where his daughter is being held? And then to basically just get his ass kicked and accomplish nothing?I didn't think that the acting or cinematography were really that bad, it just would have made more sense if the protagonist was some ""average Joe"" rather than an elite special forces veteran if we're supposed to believe he would be as bad at fighting as he was.The ending also bothered me, like oh, it's great that he's prison because now he's finally going to get some group therapy? Doesn't track."
2,The action sequences in this movie are pathetic and the plot is totally unoriginal. Lead actor looks like a beast but fights like an out of shape old man.
3,The movie starts OK and then the plot becomes a mess... and the action scenes are boring. No need to view it.
4,"This movie is watchable, but not as good as I had hoped.
Guy just gets his ass kicked most of the time.
Should have gave the script to Scott Adkins."
5,"""The Beast"" as the title translates, doesn't really ring true.Akin to films like ""Taken"" (which is also implausible) the primary issue with this film is one of realism. The key protagonist is apparently a highly skilled, special forces operative. Yet his situational awareness is poor, as is his judgement. Of course, we are told he has PTSD. Even so, that level of experience becomes instinctive, so this is a thin excuse.He blunders into multiple hostile situations. His combat skills look more like those of a simplistic street fighter. They lack polish and precision. No one with that kind of background would go in unarmed, either. A hammer, a box cutter, kitchen knife, or even a crow bar, can make a huge difference.Just as improbable, his adversaries leave him for dead at one point, rather than finishing him off. All this after he proves he is at the least a tangible, if disorganised, threat.Acting by contrast, is excellent. The main character is believable but he's let down by a script that fails to seriously ask how a soldier with this degree of training and experience, would really perform in this kind of scenario.The outcome is a film that's more or less watchable but for anyone with any real training, it offer's up far too many ""yeah right' moments to be convincing.5/10 from me."
6,"Liam Neeson has held a tough guy/image of a father since TAKEN.
After five minutes THE BEAST starts I can see so many similarities.
But THE BEAST is missing one key element: the power of kick after each punch.
Movies like these are not just about the family/love bond, but also seek ""violence"".
The title is violent but not the content.
From many scenes I can see the actor is trying to catch breath which is something you don't see in Liam Neeson's.
BTW the soundtrack where his past is described is nice, trying to find the title of the song lol.In general, it's not bad but if you are looking for movies that can bring you excitement or help you shake off chose from reality then you may want to choose another one."
7,This movie was absolutely one of the worst movies i have seen. This movie was bad in all areas starting from actors.
8,This movie is so bad on so many levels that I actually had to come here and comment on it. Seriously Netflix?!
9,"Do not fall for stupid reviews. This is an amazing movie. A short, crisp and meaningful plot. People expected this guy to fight like a superhuman. But the fact is that he had PTSD. He had panic attacks. Director took care if that fact really well. This was justified well during his fist fights. He was tired but did a father's job. A beautiful message conveyed in this movie."
10,"""The Beast"" has taken glaring inspirations from acclaimed works in the past. Meanwhile indecently disregarding its intrinsic identity! Hence, a formulaic demeanor hindering the overall execution.A Daughter in Jeopardy, A Venturesome Father, one Crime Boss/Syndicate. Sounds familiar, Isn't it? Akin to Liam Neeson starrer ""Taken""; the resemblance here is highly prominent.
Albeit I don't despise recitation of corresponding storylines, but I utterly hate the ignorance shown by makers when it comes to acknowledge any creative inputs.Technically it would suffice.
Cinematography is filled with enough buoyancy alongside a radiant imagery. A conforming Soundscore with uncouth song selections; Which I find oddly interesting.Characters are shabbily written, therefore actors were unable to deliver conclusively.
Despite giving all their earnest efforts!
A redundant & painstakingly slow screenplay failing to provide any sort of support in that matter! The writing has struggled with its own dilemmas. With pretentious attributes all over; the Action playing the second fiddle, and undue Drama getting the utmost importance.
Leaving a subsequent taste of resentment."
11,"The director is trying to make an action thriller with actors in a lot of pain and emotional music. Only the music lives up to something. The plot is lazy and illogical. The hero and his ex wife actually act well but so much of the story is ridiculously unbelievable. Ex elite soldier for thirty years who's physique hardly scares a chess player, no matter how many fake scars and tattoos. He's taking anti depressants to be able to socialise with family. Apparently they're so strong that the elite soldier forgets how to fight now and then and takes a beating by drug addicts and random hooligans even when his and his little daughter's lives are in danger as if adrenaline doesn't exist. Plot holes en masse. How did he get an ambulance when knocked out in the gangster house? Fight scenes are choreographed from the 80-s. Music and some decent acting saved this movie from a 1. Director needs to get back to school.
Even the last ""Taken"" movie is better than this soup. If you want to watch a really good movie on the same theme then watch ""Extraction"" with Hemsworth who's fight scenes are incredible and most realistic in any movie I've seen."
12,"One of the worst ""action"" movies made. Don't waste your time. This is like a C-flic...like poorly made and directed. Unbelievable in more ways than countable. Just a constant eye sore. Better off watching twilight"
13,"Acting is a little worse than you'd expect in your typical bad B action movie. Like ""first time acting gig for an athlete"" bad. Think Rhonda Roussey in Expendables X. Or Worse than Chuck Norris when he started way back when.
Script and tone are outdated. Cartoonishly written.
Fight scenes are very amateurish and outright slow. Unexciting. Made for TV.Why is this trending on Netflix?"
14,"I thought this was absolutely amazing. You can see that Leonidas struggles with PTSD on a daily basis, but you can see the deep love and affection he has for his daughter and family. He is very quiet and says almost nothing, but somehow you know what he's thinking. The action scenes were also very good, with the occasional flashback. All in all, I think this movie is very underrated and deserves a much higher score."
15,"Netflix produces and Italian version of Taken but they succeed to make The worst ""taken"" ever!"
16,"Yeah, an Italian version of ""Taken,"" but on a kind of stupid and guttural level. The fight scenes are pretty basic and sophomoric, and you have to wonder why the bad guys just don't shoot our hero instead of waiting to be punched out by him, one by one.There's some decent filmmaking here, they obviously had a budget, they just needed to spend more on a better script and fight choreographer. They left it open for a sequel, aye, hope it's better than this."
17,"Think italian taken with a hint of italian Rambo...but a hell of a lot worse than that...once it gets started, the action doesn't relent, and so there isn't enough of a pause to ponder how much this movie borrows from the action movies of the last quarter century.
Not that it matters anyway it's just blatantly obvious...the acting is HORRID, the plot...omg, my nephew Timmy is 4 year old with down syndrome, he would have done a far better job.
Just AVOID like plague and do something more productive with your time, groom your cat, watch paint dry, anything."
18,"Starts promisingly with interesting character and dynamics but is ruined by the simple fact none of the film's action would be possible if it were not for ridiculous and implausible police officers. It is inconceivable that police could be that dumb and inept and therefore very difficult to take the rest of the film seriously. It is a shame because actually the character of Leo is interesting and well acted. I disagree with some reviews who think it would have been improved by a younger actor more capable in the fight sequences. The truth is that the fight choreography is pretty second rate, but the ageing commando no longer at the peak of his form is more powerful in his desperate search.
It tries to put a newish twist on an old idea and might have succeeded. Sadly it didn't."
19,It's like a cheaper and incomplete version of Taken trilogy. Misleading title. Boring. Terrible storyline. Don't bother.
20,"That Italian flick tries something already used and overused by the US film industry: a former Special Forces member suffering of post traumatic disorder and whose daughter was abducted. I expected something new from this European film, especially released on Netflix, I expected something daring, more brutal, gritty, why not nasty, disgusting, disturbing. But directing and acting are more than OK though."
21,"The movie has a good beginning and the Beast character is perfect. But then the plot becomes really slow, the action is slow, the hero looses his strength and falls in serious danger. It is not clear the intention of the movie: an action movie, a family/love movie, both of the them ? Well in my opinion none of them had success. Finally with its rhytms movie is too long (I risked to fall asleep).
But Ludovico Di Martino has really good possibilities (scenes, lights, actors), so c'mon let show them."
22,"I think: very good acting from the bearded actor. I like Warner Bros, because I like Warner Bros Finland, I gather I must somehow like Warner Bros Italy also. and they usually produce quality, no matter if it's films or documents."
23,"La Belva is a stylishly-made-but-ultimately-generic actioner with a father-saves-daughter plot that's been done to death. Leonida Riva is an ex-army veteran suffering from PTSD and has partially disconnected himself from his wife and children. When his little daughter gets kidnapped, he revives the beast inside of him to get her back. A film that goes the 'Taken' route with slightly more layered characters, La Belva's strength lies in its set-pieces. Though there's nothing we haven't already seen, there's some beauty in the staging of a car chase or a good ol' fashioned fist-fight.As in the case of action thrillers, fallacies (Riva infiltrates places with ease) in continuity and logic are conveniently ignored. The climactic finale gets over even before it begins; the weakest of all. Fabrizio Gifuni's rugged, tough-man act is befitting the film's plot, while the rest of the cast is adequate. La Belva offers nothing new to the genre, but as an action-movie fanatic, it didn't put me to sleep either."
24,"The best part about this is that the main character isnt perfect, he gets shot, stabbed, severely beaten, gets out of breath, drowned and at one point flatlines on the way to hospital after a lengthy fight scene, which is more than i can say for most other action movie protagonists
that single shot fight scene was also pretty neatyou are worthless if you didnt think this was good
youre even more worthless if you thought it was just ""italian version of taken"" go die i hate you leave this placeEDIT: hey do u guys think its weird that a lot of the negative review accounts were made around 2017 and this is the only movie theyve rated
really makes u think"
25,"Can understand why people say it's similar to taken but don't get turned off by that, just give it a watch and it does pull you in..."
26,"Waiting for your treatment at the dentist is more exciting than this no plot, no idea movie. Honestly, nobody's going to give you the time back you have invested watching this. Go and meet friends, drink a beer at your local bar, argue with your husband or wife.. every action will be more meaningful than watching that movie!"
27,"Do not listen to bad reviews from people who are used to super heros. Our hero was a special forces Capten with a difficult past, full of tortures. Now, away from all of that he is trying to get by, fighting his demons through drug medication. He is alienated from his family (son and wife) but his little daughter loves him greately.
One time, when going to see their father, the two kids stop at a burger house. The son didn't want to go to his father's house. Instead, he meets with sone friends there and, suddenly, his sister is kidnapped.
Then, their dad goes ""hunting"", trying to find his daughter.
In a few words, this is not another ""Taken"" movie. Our hero can be hurt, hit and lose. But he stands again to continue fighting. He has a brutal past, but that doesn't make him invicible. That's what's great in this movie. The vulnerability of the character. Last but not least, the movie is also very emotional, especially in the end, when son and father bond again. Don't miss it"
28,"Fabrizio Gifuni is the Italian Liam Neeson in this kidnapped-daughter-rescue-revenge plot. What starts off as an intriguing genre flick quickly dwindles into a low-energy, blood-soaked mess, interspersed with the occasional slow-motion montage, backed by an F-list soundtrack. I'd rather watch ""Taken 3"" again."
29,"Not a bad Italian action film, a simple story. The main credible actor, the rest a little less. enough for the attempt"
30,"I really like this movie. Great tension. Great acting, great rythm! 10/10"
31,"This movie is an Italian 'Taken', except bad action, extreme plot holes, very lazy writing, with many scenes (i.e. most) being deus ex machina with something unrealistic happening at the last split second. No character depth, with many roles as stereotypical as possible without any hint of originality.Cartoonish, over the top bad guy..check
Brooding teenager for no reason...check
Dumbest cops ever...check
Hero should be dead multiple times but not...check
People appear exactly where they need to to propel plot without explaining how they got there...check."
32,"HOW DOES A MOVIE THIS BAD ACTUALLY GET MADE?
ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN."
33,"Should call as the weird luck dude or worse fighter or I get beaten, or retard looking orger."
34,"Ignore the reviews from the kids raised on superhero movies who think the hero is a bad fighter. These people have never been in a fight in their life and think flashy moves, CGI and quippy one-liners are how it goes down.
The hero is a badass who holds back nothing as a desperate father doing what it takes to protect his family. The fighting is far more realistic to anyone who has actually experienced one and the pacing is great for events that take place in a single night.
For my money one of the best movies of 2020 and a superb example of the hero dad genre."
35,"I was expecting The Beast to be something like the Italian version of Liam Neeson's Taken trilogy, but it eventually turned out to be a much more serious and somewhat more credible crime thriller. The story was relatively slow-paced and straightforward, but it did have a few surprising moments. The protagonist proved to be a pretty realistic representation of a traumatized individual and the villains were pitted against him as equals who were actually able to physically hurt him, rather than allowing him to kill them within a matter of seconds. The setting was a gloomy and relatively compact one, with the protagonist having to find and rescue his kidnapped daughter within the limits of his hometown in the middle of a drizzly winter. He eventually managed to do so by using his observational skills and asking an old friend for a little bit of assistance. However, it has to be emphasized that he was frequently lucky enough to discover the right pieces of evidence and information at the right time, which provided the movie with quite a few coincidences of the kind that not every viewer will see as entirely realistic."
36,"If you don't mind the casual violence and nudity, there is a great story here. Fabrizio is seeing red and he steals a car to save a young lady in distress. Apparently it takes copious amounts of cocaine to pump him up like the Hulk (the Beast). He even robs a drag queen of her goods at a gas station. He a lovable vigilante that has a death wish IMHO. What do you think of the violent maniac saving your life on the streets? Oh well! I believe in Pax and Benevolence.....altruism is the name of my game, (and also my superhero too!). Cheers! Murf"
37,"The movie is watchable and actors are decent in performance. Especially the main character who looks true enough when PTSD is getting over him.However..Battle and action scenes are less than poor. From the way people holding their guns (no trained person would do it like this) to the point fighting scenes are taking place looking slow , similar to a training pace.A person who is supposed to have such a long time in special forces as described , should at least have a certain fighting style and pattern , quite distinctive from average persons or even thugs.All in all, good effort in plot and acting...but failed huge when it comes to battle/fight choreography. In an action movie this should be a pro+ and not a con-movie to my opinion is a 6 to 6.5. Watchable but nothing more than that."
38,"I enjoyed the movie. Lots of action, some suspense, and a little twist of the ages old story between good and evil, with its shades gray."
39,"Good action flick, brutal fight scenes, enjoyed the movie's darkness and at time sadness, strong ending."
40,"The subject of the film and the script are very cool, but the actors' game 5/10 could have been made with a better cast and the hero himself could have more spectacular moves overall rating 6/10"
41,"11/28/2029 Not a bad movie but far from a great one too. Reasonably enjoyable, never exciting and zero suspense. The 5.4 IMDb stars is on target. A one time only movie. The following are titles of two of the already posted reviews. They describe this movie the best. 1. Not bad but nothing that we haven't seen before! 2. Slow Mo Action / Plot gaps & mess. Dismiss the 9 and 10 scores, they're wrong. Bon Appetit'"
42,"They had no script, and just keep making up as they filmed. A special forces soldier that can't fight, policemen that can't shoot and are easy fooled. Bad choreography in the two or three action scenes."
43,"One of the worst films I've seen. Goodness knows why I sat through it. A script full of holes, and I've seen better acting in school plays. Please don't waste your time."
44,"They say there is nothing like Mama Bear (I think they say that, but you know what I mean in any case) ... well get a hold of Papa Bear(d)! He ain't playing around either. Seemingly unstoppable - or is he? One thing is for sure, he aims for the throat and he goes right for the target. No distractions and alll that other stuff police has to worry about.Which of course make him a target for the police too. A very down and dirty movie ... gritty and unapologetic! With a main performance that is quite mesmerizing to say the least. If that sounds like something you can agree and watch, than look no further. So can you dig it? And can you stomach it?"
45,"Imagine a action movie where an elite special forces team is almost eradicated by a few Al Queda types and the main character, a 30 year special forces veteran of multiple campaigns, show zero fighting skills and almost gets beat up by a 130 lb druggie. That's La Belva. I tried very, very hard to like this movie, but, it's impossible. The script is awful, the fight sequences are laughable and the plot holes are maddening.This is one of the worst movies of 2020."
46,Bad movie do they really have to show Arabs are bad why ?? That was not needed and the movie is not related to the name too
47,"I doubt if anyone can watch this movie about a 30 year of service Special
Forces Captain, who has to overcome his own demons to rescue his very
young daughter, without any reference to Liam Neesom's 'Taken' trifecta.La Belva isn't as good a fighter as Neesom but does a reasonable job and has
plenty of fights, not always winning, and sometimes getting the tar knocked
out of him; however he recovers and just keeps on going and going.This movie will never win an Oscar, but for 90 minutes of fisticuffs entertainment, it is well worth a look, and I give it 6/10."
48,"I just wanna say that I expected much more from a dude that was in special forces for 30 years, dude can barely fight 1v1s, we didn't even get that feeling where this guy should literally be invincible taking into account that he has all that experience and even in a gunfight my guy cant aim in the head from 5 meters pathetic imo. In general the story is nothing new but kind of promising in the beginning, but just goes downhill by being slow paced and this guy getting beaten up in every scene we literally see lol. Average movie don't really recommend it honestly, if you watch it don't except much from it"
49,Never seen an action star take this much of a beating! I thought he was one of the kidnappers the way he was carrying on! 0 rewatch value 1 and done
