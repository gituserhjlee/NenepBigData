0,"Recently got a chance to watch this. I like the film with Gwyneth Paltrow, and absolutely love the BBC miniseries, so I was cautious watching this, especially with the several bad reviews. I don't know if it was because I went in with low expectations, but I was delighted by this movie! Admittedly if you don't know the story, it can move fast, but to be fair, the book is long and tedious, with a lot to fit in two hours, which is one of my problems with the 2008 movie. The visuals and fashions of this movie are beautiful, and Emma's character did show improvement unlike some of the comments I saw. This one definitely captured Jane Austen's humor, and you can be guaranteed to laugh a few times. The BBC mini-series is still my top rated, but the 2020 ""Emma."" is, in my opinion, a notch above the 2008 ""Emma"", but would definitely recommend all adaptations, especially the book."
1,"Autumn de Wilde's Emma, with Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn, is not my cup of tea, I'm afraid. My review might be influenced by how much I love Jane Austen's novel and how many times I've watched the 2009 miniseries, but I always give every adaptation a try. And I can't really judge if what I was watching would make sense to an Austen virgin, shall we say, so what seemed disjointed and rushed to me might work perfectly for others.I'll start with the good: I loved the costumes and the interiors, which were sumptuously beautiful. The wood-shaving ringlets on the women and the high collars on the men were distracting, though. And of course Anya Taylor-Joy made for a quirky and regal Emma (Austenites will be pleased to note that she has perfect posture.) I also loved how Anya Taylor-Joy and Amber Anderson as Jane actually played the pianoforte during the Coles' party (but could have done without Mr Knightley's contribution, when Frank Churchill is supposed to be singing with Jane). BUT. The music was horrendously jarring, alternating between Hanna Barbera cartoon incidentals and freakish folk music. The supporting characters suffered once again - I couldn't honestly tell the difference between Mrs Weston, Mrs Knightley and Mrs Elton, except that Isabella was for some reason a complete cow in this version, and Mr Elton and Frank Churchill were also interchangeable (perhaps that's why Elton never seemed to be without his dog collar, to help tell them apart). Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was a weird combination of fusspot and Edwardian fop, and Johnny Flynn's Mr Knightley strayed way off character by stripping off in his first scene and never really recovered for me. (Apparently, that was a way of 'humanising' the character because he is always 'mansplaining' - very woke.) Anya wasn't kidding when she talked about the focus being on 'bodily functions', by the way - not only are we 'treated' to Knightley's backside, but Emma hitches up her skirts to warm her bare arse by the fire, and the 'cannot make speeches' proposal scene is a bloody mess. Literally. The script leans so heavily on lines from the novel that I think Eleanor Catton thought she was writing an essay for an English Lit exam - Austenites will be happy, but there was no feeling behind any of the grand words. When Emma and Mr Knightley argue, they constantly shout over each other, for instance, instead of the usual playful back and forth.The whole film felt like a weird mashup between a stage musical and a Victorian farce, with choreographed servants and slapstick humour. There was also a lot of 1996 Emma in there, taking pastel and pastoral scenery from the film and Andrew Davies' wearisome obsession with wealth from the television two-parter. Not on a sliding scale of Emma and Miss Bates, but in how Mr Knightley's strawberry picking party turns into a National Trust promotional video for Wilton House, Salisbury. There's also a lot of emphasis on servants dressing their masters and mistresses, presumably to fit in more scenes of 'natural nudity'.I went, I watched, I did my duty to Emma. But I think I'll stick with the 2009 miniseries."
2,"Yes, to prepare myself for this film I read the book. It was long, it was difficult to read- but it was delightful masterpiece which I grew to love at the end. This film felt unneeded when the first trailer dropped (How many film adaptions of this story are there? 7?) but I must say that in a world drowning in superhero sci-fi movies, prequels, sequels, and reboots- this was a breath of fresh air. The chemistry between the characters and the sublime and subtle direction paired with the intelligent dialogue and supreme Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma (her performance give Gwyenith Palrow a run for her money) are all testament that we need a film like this- not a physical action trhiller, but rather an intelligent comedy with great development."
3,"It looks gorgeous - fashions, interiors, etc - and it has a good cast. But it lacks the depth, subtle observation and wit of Austen's superb novel. Some of the characters are more like caricatures (Mr Woodhouse and Mr Elton, in particular). This works well in Dickens but not for Austen. It is difficult, admittedly, within the space of a two-hour movie to show character development and to do justice to the subplots, consequently some aspects of the story seemed very rushed. Yet the director wastes valuable screen time showing people walking down corridors, strolling about in the grounds, etc. Also - huge problem here - Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn (both good actors) have a serious lack of on-screen chemistry.
Disappointing! Can't hold a candle to the 1996 version starting Gwynneth Paltrow and Jeremy Northam, in my view."
4,"Emma is one of my favorite Jane Austin novels. This production is a travesty overall. The costumes and hair and locations are sumptuous and beautiful but do little to cover the fact that the director and perhaps lead actress did not understand the book at all.Emma is meant to be charming and sweet if wrong headed and a bit spoiled. Her heart is good and she's usually incredibly kind except when under the influence of Frank Churchill and she immediately regrets her actions.In this version, Emma is rendered to be a superscillious brat with no real thought for anyone but herself. Bill Nighy is seriously underused and is one of the bright spots in the film. Miranda Hart is the only other bright spot. I'm not sure what on earth they were thinking. 2 hours of film went by without hitting in any part of the story that would lead to coherence. There was zero chemistry between any of the characters. They took a story that's light and charming and made it heavy and distasteful.I'd definitely not recommend this to either readers of the book or anyone else because they definitely will not have even a fraction of an understanding of the tone of the book and wonder why on earth anyone could care about this story at all.How very sad that they could have done a modern remake like this and just completely miss the mark."
5,"This is by far the weirdest version of Emma I have ever seen. I love the book and am a huge fan of the 1996 (Paltrow) and 2009 (Garai) movie versions, but this 2020 version is just bizarre! Emma is supposed to be about transformation. A beautiful, spoiled girl becoming a loving and caring woman. This Emma was spoiled and rude the entire file and didn't change at all. Mr. Knightley is one of my favorite literary heroes, but this version didn't showcase any of his (or Emma's) good qualities. There wasn't anything likable about any of the main characters (Mr. Woodhouse being the only exception). ""Badly done, Emma! Badly done indeed."""
6,"If you love pantomime, you'll love the latest incarnation of Jane Austen's Emma. If you've read the book or seen the TVC series or last film adaption, all I can say is if you set great expectations your bound to be disappointed with this latest incarnation that leaves you walking out of the cinema saying why .......The film is beautifully shot, the costumes and cinematographic should win awards .... where it does fall over is the acting .... Jane was making a parody of the upper and middle classes ... but this version slams people over the head with the delivery and over dramatised characterisation of the characters, there is no humanity or redeemable features in any of them ... just comical and inane pauses, over dramatisation .... If you come out of a movie vainly trying to find its redeemable features like Miranda Hart's version of Miss Bates or Connor Swindells Mr Martin, I am struggling to find any improvement of past versions of this novel. It does look stunning but like many beautiful things in life lacked any substance, character or depth."
7,"Some fatal attraction means I must watch new Jane Austen screen adaptations although I find them invariably less than satisfying. This version of Emma is no exception as its faults are egregious. I could tell almost straight away it was going to be gimmicky in the way that filmmakers of dubious merit think they can add bits of business to wonderful classics, or distort things completely, as an ""improvement"". I fantasize that, in a better world, there might be some court to hear applications to make screen adaptations, to determine whether the filmmaker actually understands what it is about the story and the characters that give these works of literature their timeless appeal. So often they don't, as they change and destroy what is so fundamental to the success of the original. Somebody give them a ""Cliff's Notes"" to read, at the very least!
Emma Woodhouse, the heroine of ""Emma"" is a likeable, open-natured young woman, who has faults but learns to become a better person. That's in the novel, anyway. The Emma depicted in this film wears alternately an arrogant or sulky expression, seems to have selfish and nasty motives and thoroughly deserves to be taken down a peg, which more or less happens. Newsflash to the filmmaker - she is such an unpleasant person that I don't care. Mr Knightley is a calm, confident sophisticated man of the world, someone of deep and genuine feelings - and dead sexy with it. Johnny Flynn's version is a nice young man but something of a klutz. How does he even like this hardfaced Emma? - again you've lost me. I have to contrast the failure of the lead characters to pull their weight in delivering the story, with the Romola Garai/Jonny Lee Miller version where they got it so right.
To carry on with the catalogue of ""wrongness"" in this version, Frank Churchill, an important and attractive character in the story, is presented by an actor lacking in looks and charm, a complete nonentity. To mention some minor characters, I fully expected Bill Nighy to ham it up with the Mr Woodhouse character, and he does. But why oh why do they have to make Emma's sister Isabella and brother-in-law John Knightley unpleasant and unhappy people - it's so wrong! While not a major theme, their domestic happiness is a beacon to Emma and Mr Knightley to follow their example, and recognize their destiny. I could go on - Harriet Smith isn't pretty, Miss Bates isn't talkative enough, and Mr Elton is a grinning gargoyle. If I pull myself up with an effort to acknowledge the positives of the film, there are beautiful landscapes and house interiors, and great costumes and hairstyles, real eye candy. The dialogue is reasonably respectful of the original. But I wasn't happy for a minute watching the film. I am entitled to have high expectations of a Jane Austen adaptation, and was majorly disappointed, so only a 4/10."
8,Visually beautiful...but empty of soul....really dreadful...Emma (the lead) was particularly awful....save your time/money--see other versions..this one was torture to sit through
9,"My goodness. Have read some reviews and I see no middle ground....2s or 9s..Someone mentions that Mr. Elton is a caricature...this is true so was Mr. Collins. Methinks, Ms. Austen liked to poke fun at the clergy.The nudity reminded me of the wet shirt scene in Pride & Prejudice in 1995 TV adaptation. Didn't bother me. They were naked under all those clothes back then too.I commend the casting, the performances, the costumes, and much more. I always approach Austen movies with trepidation. I always fear disappointment, but that rarely happens and this no exception.The director is a photographer and approached the scenes with a photographer's eye. If you look at the frames, many are beautifully symmetrical photographic portraits. Loved the visuals. I compare it to CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT just in this respect. If you really watch that fabulous Orson Welles movie, the framing looks like the paintings of Dutch Masters (especially the scenes with Fallstaff, Silence, and Shallow out at the country house).No chemistry between the two leads? Well, if you read Austen you know that Knightley is considerably older than Emma and watched her grow up due to the family's connections. Emma and Knightley's siblings are married to each other.Knightley admires her from afar and is betwixt friendship, sibling, buddy, et. al. with Emma. This is played well in the earlier parts of the movie. The attraction develops into more and as Emma ages it is more appropriate. The nuance of this progression is well done.I don't know if I should call certain little gems, Easter Eggs, or hidden meanings. But, I found Harriet's moaning and sighing on the couch after twisting her ankle, well, you know...as Knightley is attending to her foot so clever. I laughed out loud.Well done by all. And I guess after reading some reviews, not all found it thus. I recommend a second viewing."
10,"This wasn't a very good adaptation. The story flow was somewhat disjointed and music was strange. Sometimes piano and then it jumped to some sort of religious or gospel music? The story jumps so much that characters remain pretty shallow. Actors just don't have enough time to develop their roles. There were also some unfortunate actor choices, such as for roles of Miss Woodhouse, Knightley and Churchhill. Miss Woodhouse was so cold and a bit nasty, which created the overall unpleasant atmoshphere. The undertone was so mean that it took the comedy part out. Mr Knightley was so mellow, so overcooked macaroni that one hardly noticed he was there. He was missing that stingy sharpness. Frank Churchill stands around and all the flirting and energy is no where to be seen.One cannot help comparing to the 2009 four episode adaptation of Emma. It is so superb version! Romola Garai absolutely nails as Emma, she is so happy, energetic and in a right way funny and vain. And every actor even in a smallest roles are so perfect.Bill Nighy did his usual vague situation comedy act as a Mr Woodhouse. It worked like a clock of course, but then again those scenes were from a different movie. Miranda Hart was decently loud as a Miss Bates. Only sunshine was actor for Miss Smith, new face, and a really fresh take. There was a interesting side roles from some Sex Education actors.Some mandatory nudity was added and a couple of roles in scenes are reverted. As such these scenes were fine, alone, but they just don't fit well to overall story.
The duet of Miss Fairfax and Mr Knightley diminished Mr Churchhill's role to periphery and took out his change to wickedness and why he rattled this little community so. Mr Knighley running after Emma's wagon was probably meant as a romantic gesture, but who does such things? Even in a great emotion, run miles in a moments of anxiety and especially in a time when social norms were very restricting? And somehow Miss Smith ventures to a forest just after a ball?If you want to see Emma, dont' waist your time for this. Watch the 2009 Emma. It is four episodes (a lot of time during the covid2019!), and Jonny Lee Miller (US Sherlock!) as Mr Knightley."
11,"Unfortunately for me, this version of Emma was more a miss than a hit. It was too slow & failed to draw me in. Some of the scenes were just too long or superfluous, making me wish for them to hurry up to get to the good bits. Visually speaking it was lovely & depicted the Regency period well. But the soundtrack was often jarring & distracting rather than enhancing a scene. The odd choir singing is a case in point.I could not like Emma herself. Anya Taylor-Joy was miscast, in my opinion. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was her unusual eyes? I know I disliked her hairstyles intensely. Horrid! I couldn't connect with her character.I thought some of the characters were wishy washy. You would not know that Emma's sister Isabella is married to Mr Knightly's brother John. Or perhaps I blinked & missed it? Jane Fairfax was fairly insipid & there was not much to indicate that Frank Churchill was a bit of a cad weaving elaborate lies. Bill Nighy's Mr Woodhouse was too childish & effeminate for my liking. Mr Knightly, whilst likeable, was a bit childish for his age & station & not a match for this particular Emma & I could picture her walking all over him.The actors I did enjoy were the characters of Mrs Weston, Harriet Smith & Miss Bates, played by Gemma Whelan, Mia Goth & Miranda Hart. Gemma Whelan of Game of Thrones fame, handled Mrs Weston with dignity & grace. Harriet was delightful & suitably innocent & gullible. My favourite character in this adaption was Miranda Hart's portrayal of the unfortunate Miss Bates. Miranda is an expert at playing socially awkward characters & did not disappoint with Miss Bates. Her embarrassment & vulnerability at Emma's spiteful words at the picnic brought me to tears. As did her graciousness in accepting Emma's attempt at an apology. Bravo Miranda!So there were some redeeming scenes throughout the movie. But overall, it fell short of my expectations & the 1996 version of Emma remains my favourite to date."
12,"I have previously seen three TV versions of Emma, and the 1990s Hollywood film with Gwyneth Paltrow - which I find excessively sentimental. Emma is not my favourite Austen novel, but the adaptation used for the 2020 film version is generally very good. One or two specifics are omitted, but this is inevitable in compression to the running time of just over two hours.As all reviews have noted, the film is beautifully designed and shot. Some of the design may even be thought to be over the top, but I thought that was consonant with the mannered approach of the cast, an approach which works well in making this essentially a comedy of manners as well as a love story. The detective story element of the novel doesn't go for very much - little is made of the piano, and Frank Churchill's slip in knowing about Dr Perry's carriage is omitted.I thought Mia Goth's well-rounded performance of Harriet the best I have seen, and it is certainly difficult to take one's eyes off Anya Taylor-Joy in the titular lead. Other female performances are perhaps more so-so, although Chloe Pirie's harassed Isabella is interesting. The comedic Mr Elton would be well over the top in some adaptations but just about fits in here. Other male roles are adequately filled even though the portrayal of john Knightly is slightly bizarre. Bill Nighy is...well, Bill Nighy, this time with amazing costume.I enjoyed it, and I intend to see it again soon. Overall I would just favour the 1996 Kate Beckinsale ITV version but this is close behind and in some ways better"
13,"I loved the look of ""Emma"" from the trailer. And I was not disappointed. It is a simply sublime piece of comic entertainment.Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a rich, privileged 21 year-old looking after her elderly and quirky father (Bill Nighy) in the family stately home. She has never loved, despite the persistent presence of 'family friend' George Knightley (Johnny Flynn), but finds it entertaining to engage in matchmaking, particularly in respect to her somewhat lower class friend Harriet Smith (Mia Goth). Emma has high ambitions for Harriet... ideas significantly above what her social station and looks might suggest.Emma has her sights on a dream.... the mystery man Frank Churchill (Callum Turner), son of wealthy local landowner Mr Weston (Rupert Graves). She has never actually met him, but is obsessed with his myth. #fangirl. As a source of immense annoyance to her, but often a source of valuable information on news of Churchill, is the village 'old maid' Miss Bates (Miranda Hart). ""Such fun""!But Emma's perfect life is about to face sticky times, as her machinations fail to yield the expected results and a stray comment, at a disastrous picnic, threatens to damage both her reputation and her social standing.If you like your movies full of action and suspense, you are digging in the wrong place. ""Emma"" is slow... glacially slow... wallowing in beautiful bucolic scenes (with superb cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt); gorgeous costumes by Alexandra Byrne; and hair styling by Marese Langan.The movie also benefits from a joyfully tight and funny script by debut screenwriter Eleanor Catton (a Man-Booker prize winner). This picks relentlessly at the strata of the class system set up by Jane Austen's novel: ""Every body has their level"" spits spurned suitor Mr Elton (Josh O'Connor).I know Anya Taylor-Joy as the spirited Casey from ""Split"" and ""Glass"": she was impressive in ""Split""; less so for me in the disappointing ""Glass"". But here, I found her UTTERLY mesmerising. She has such striking features - those eyes! - that she fully inhabits the role of the beautiful heiress who haunts multiple men sequentially. I even muttered the word ""Oscar nomination"" at the end of the film: though we are too early in the year to seriously go there.An even bigger surprise was the actor playing George Knightley. Johnny Flynn has been in a number of TV shows I haven't seen, and a few films I haven't seen either (e.g. ""Beast""). But I had the nagging feeling I knew him really well. The illustrious Mrs Movie Man clocked him: he's the Cineworld ""plaid man""! (For those outside the UK or not patrons of Cineworld cinemas, he was the 'star' of a Cineworld advert that played over and Over AND OVER again for months on end before every film I saw. Arrrgggghhhh!).Here, Flynn is excellent as the frustrated and brooding Austen-hunk. He even gets away with an ar*e-shot within a U-certificate!Particularly strong in the supporting cast are Bill Nighy (being delightfully more restrained in his performance); Miranda Hart (being ""Miranda"", but perfectly cast) and Mia Goth (memorable for that eel-bath in ""A Cure for Wellness"").And a big thank-you for a web review in the online Radio Times for naming one of the comical (and bizarrely uncredited) footmen as Angus Imrie - - the truly disturbed stepson of Claire in ""Fleabag"". It was driving me crazy where I knew him from!The one criticism I would have is that I found the (perfectly fine and well-fitting) music, by David Schweitzer and Isobel Waller-Bridge (sister of Phoebe) poorly mixed within the soundtrack. There were times when I found it overly intrusive, suddenly ducking under dialogue and then BLASTING out again. Sometimes music should be at the forefront.... but more often it should be barely perceptible.As you might guess....
...I loved this one. The story is brilliant (obsv!); the film is simply gorgeous to look at; the locations (including the village of Lower Slaughter in the Cotswolds and Wilton House - near me - in Salisbury) are magnificent and a blessing for the English Tourist Board.All the more impressive then that this is the directorial feature of video/short director Autumn de Wilde.This comes with a ""highly recommended"" from both myself and the illustrious Mrs Movie-Man.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on Facebook or the web.)"
14,"Fun, stylistic, and is basically everything I wanted from the film. The color palette was absolutely gorgeous. I really enjoyed this film and I think any audience member will If they are into period pieces"
15,"Doing another Emma, or any new Austin film, is utterly pointless unless it brings something distinctly new to the old story. High quality mere faithfulness, treating the old as somehow sacrosanct, is pointless. This rendition brings unique comedic verve to the old story, great acting, and wonderful photography, all of it edgy, pushing the angles, and the pace, to the max. If you want ""standard fare Austin"" as most reviewers seem to, you won't get it, and won't like it. Everything here is played over the top, manga meets Austin. If you think that Austin was as edgy and irreverent as she could be and should be played to the max that way now, in order to make her fully alive now, then you might love this version, as I did."
16,"As a Jane Austen enthusiast, an avid reader and an obsessive film watcher, I was anxious to watch it as soon as it came out in cinemas. After watching the trailer, I was a little bit off put, with the sickly overdose of pastels coming from all directions, but the presence of the wonderful Miranda Hart amongst the cast made it seem a bit brighter. Nevertheless, I walked into the cinema excited. The glowing reviews on the sides of buses were enough to convince me it would be a great film.That is 2 hours and 12 minutes of my fleeting life I will never get back.To start with the positives, the costumes were historically accurate, which seemed to justify the film for some folks, but apart from that, it was downright unenjoyable.To start, I did not like the scene of Mr Knightley at the beginning where we all experienced the misfortune at looking upon the actors bare butt. For me, it felt very out of character for Mr Knightley, and certainly not something I would associate with an Austen novel. Perhaps it was supposed to showcase vulnerability? But surely there are more clearer ways of doing that than putting his rear on show.I found the character of Emma to be someone completely different from the book. Instead of a girl who has good intentions, but has her flaws, she is portrayed as nothing less of a sulky brat. I wasn't fond of Mr Knightley or Frank Churchill, the both seemed shallow and deprived of any liveliness, or any signs of life.The film is slow paced, and I like long films, I've happily sat through films over three hours long, but this one had me wishing it would end. Its pointless shots of scenery, and the immaculate detail of shops and homes were pretty, but I felt like I was watching the same thing over and over, and over again.I was not fond of the dialogue, it was drawn out, I assume we were supposed to take note of the characters facial expressions, but I ended up daydreaming and forgetting I was in a cinema and supposed to be watching a film.And the comedy. If you can even call it that, was something else. It seemed to be veering towards almost a slapstick, with the running ""joke"" of Mr Woodhouse's ""do you feel a breeze"" boring and unfunny. Not to mention the questionable facial expressions that were intended for our ""entertainment""???? My heart completely sunk to the floor when they decided to have Emma's nose begin to bleed throughout one of the most important scenes. Some have interpreted this as presenting her as imperfect, or a sign of vulnerability or whatever, but to me this ruined the charm and beauty of the scene.What really caused me to roll my eyes was the passionate kiss between the protagonist and Mr Knightley. What I love about Austen, and many of the adaptions (not this one) is the way that social standards are clear for us to see, and the central couple do not rely on physicality to show us their affections (as in the book it is not talked of) but we see their affections in the way they speak, the way they look at each other, they way they interact. In this adaption however, there is no chemistry between Emma and Knightley.In my opinion, it is overrated. If you want to watch an enchanting adaption of Emma with all the charm of the book, I would suggest the 2009 version."
17,"Lately I have been watching a lot of movies, and I really love doing so. I realised that making movies is also an art form and if you look closely or experience enough, you can realise little details that make the director talk to the audience. All the choices have meanings and purposes. All the movies are different and trying to be different things, for different moments and different audiences.
I want to try different genres in movies, and so that's what I'm doing. Before that movie, I hadn't watched a period drama seriously. So I sat down and watched this. I had no idea about what to expect from a Jane Austen adaptation -despite the fact that I'm a serious bookworm and actually like classics, I haven't read any Jane Austen books.
Firstly, Emma was a good character. She knew what she wanted from the start and she had her standarts and priorities. It's not really easy to accept you've been wrong about a lot of things your whole life. She had her own legitimate reasons to be the way she was. She was well mannered and pleasant-spoken. Throughout the movie she learned that she had been selfish and actually didn't think other people's happiness, or when giving advices she thought for herself, not for the other person. She learned to think more before speaking. She has developed a lot and it's actually a great thing to show. Also Anya Taylor-Joy was great, she did a good job portraying Emma. I enjoyed watching her a lot, I now want to watch The Queen's Gambit more to see what she does with Beth and that awesome story.
All the side characters and what they sometimes symbolized were good also. Harriet was such a sweetheart, I found her annoying sometimes but I guess that movie had a thing like making characters in the extreme. She learned to be herself and not someone else who she thought was perfect, because she doesn't need to be perfect to be happy and make other people happy. Also nobody is perfect. She learned to forgive and apologize. Everybody paid a price for the wrong things they had done. And all the actors were great.
I loved ALL the places in the movie. Every costume was amazing, every piece of fabric literally shined through screen. The camera was stable so we actually got to see little details put into the scenes to make them complete. The colour palet was pastel, I loved it. I also really liked how they seperated the movie into chapters (using seasons like it was in La La Land or Juno) and the punto was also really cute. It's maybe because I watched Christopher Nolan's The Prestige before this but I found the movie a little bit static. I was kind of bored, but I also can't think any better way to shoot this movie. The cinematography was one of the best parts of the movie actually, so pleasing to look at.
The score was also good, so in touch with the movie and the audience. I really apreciate good scores.
I think it was a feel-good movie. I felt really happy after watching it. Yes, it was static but I felt like it knew what it was. That's a movie to watch when you're tired or your mood is low to raise it up. It doesn't have any hard-to-follow dialogs or scenes, and it's not that serious really. The humour was okay, not really my type I guess but I still enjoyed it. I also think not everyone may like the movie, because it may be watched in the wrong time. We should take it as what it is and not try to make it something else in my opinion.
Overall it was a sweet movie. Not the type I would watch again but I still enjoyed it. I feel like it should be watched to -as I said- raise mood. It's not a must-experience-before-dying movie but still a harmless way to spend 2 hours for movie lovers."
18,"First of all, let me start by saying that I enjoy pretty much every Austen adaptation - this was no exception.
Second of all, let's draw the comparison between a movie and cake. I came into this movie knowing full well what type of cake I both wanted and expected it to be and was not disappointed.Story: The same story we know and love - no unexpected twists or new storytelling methods (like the timeline changeup of the new Little Women). I wanted a delightful butter cake and that's exactly what I got - no wild new flavour combinations. It's a delightlfully fun, occasionally ridiculous, romp. I did enjoy the little extra Mr Nightly affection we get to see in the version - makes the romance feel a little less sudden.Visual: If it were a cake, 'Emma' would be the most repinned, insta-worthy new buttercream cake on the block. Every single scene was shot absolutely beautifully and with so much attention to detail. The soft colours and pretty scenery make every shot look like what we all wish our wedding photos came out like. They play up a bit more of the Woodhouse/Knightly wealth and there is some sumptuous decore to enjoy.Acting: I'm a Miranda Hart fan and I'm glad to say she did not disappoint. She brought the perfect mix of 'ridiculous' and 'sweet/pitiable' to Miss Bates. The rest of the cast did a very solid job and of course Bill Nighy is always a great addition to any ensemble. If the cast is the structural integrity of the cake, this cake isn't going to flop.All in all, I'd say it's exactly as it should be."
19,"I have a keen historical interest in the Regency period and I could find no fault in this spectacular recreation of the time and place. The photography drew me intimately into the action, the costumes male and female were gorgeous, the hats outrageous and straight out of Gillray and Rowlandson cartoons. Despite knowing the book and numerous screen depictions, I am sure I have never before laughed so openly or so frequently, at the sublime visual reactions of all cast members to telling points in the dialogue. As an example, Emma's face when Jane starts to play is an absolute picture. I sat through this very familiar tale with bated breath in anticipation of this ingenious and refreshing treatment of the development of the action. It would be unfair to single out individuals - a superb team effort."
20,"Of course, we all love the Mr. Knightleys and Mr. Darcys that Jane Austen has brought into feminine romance. Stick to the versions from the 1990's, if you want to keep some romance in your imagination intact.This new version is absolutely bad. What starts out as a maybe-funny movie, quickly turns into feeling like sitting in the audience of a cheap opera. Too much is staged (moving of figures, music). They must have put a lot of money in the scene prop and general production design. Instead of kicking the screenplay writers in the butte to come up with a more vivid plot adaption.
The main actress (what is wrong with her posture and neck?) ruins the whole film. She is just no person to identify with, trying the hardest being somewhat romantic.
Additionally, almost all scenes filmed outside are terrible in lighting or fail to communicate they season they are meant to represent. The ones filmed inside, however, are heavily overloaded and overcomposed.
One good thing: the cast (apart from the lead) was pretty well chosen. Thanks to Bill Nighy as Emmas's father, who constantly displays an air of self-irony throughout the whole film, I did not leave prior to the movie's end. And all the other antagonists were well cast, too.
Save yourself time and money and stick to your own imagination. Read the book, or grab the copy on DVD with Gwyneth Paltrow. I really hated that movie (it was a sneak preview and many people left long before the film ended)."
21,"Not really sure why we need another film adaption of this novel when they're already a few better versions out there. The acting was awkward and stiff, it felt like a play where the actors were still getting used to their lines or acting as if they were performing in a Pantomine.It does look stunning but like many beautiful things in life lacked any substance, character or depth. It's wonderful to watch for its costume design, sets and location shots but falls over everywhere else. #Emma #focusfeatures #emma2020 #emmathemovie2020"
22,"The story is completely ruined and the delicately and beautifully crafted personalities that Jane Austen had created are non-existent in this movie.
No real feeling of Victorian times.
Very poor actor selection. Just compare THE Mr Knightley in the book with this foolish guy!
I'm really sorry for people who made this. Poor Jane Austen!Just watch the BBC miniseries of Emma from 2009. That's not perfect either but much much much closer to what Austen had written."
23,"This movie is beautiful to look at. The shots of the English countryside, the beautiful homes, the costumes. Some of the actors are even even easy on the eyes, especially Anya Taylor-Joy, the Emma, who is also a fine actress, and really creates a character.And then there is the plot, such as it is, and the dialogue, which may come directly from Austin's novel. I don't know. Nor do I care. It's supposed to be clever. To me, it was just flat. Perhaps it was the dialogue itself, perhaps it was the way it was delivered.Go back and watch the Pride and Prejudice from 1940, with Greer Garson et al., directed by Robert Z. Leonard, with a script by Aldous Huxley. That's brilliant. I've watched it I don't know how many times, and it still holds me.This movie, on the other hand, had me begging for it to be over. I just did not care about any of the characters. Except the husband of the other daughter, Emma's brother-in-law. He suffered mightily, so I understood him."
24,"Excellent and exquisite. This rendition of Emma knows what it's about and delivers it delightfully. I have to say, here Emma is a real biotch - she is cold and bites hard (in a playful, devilishly cruel kind of way of course). But while she starts off mean as heck, this gives her more opportunity to grow - and by the end of this beautiful movie, you've seen Emma change and mature dramatically.I think it's interesting to note that the '96 version opening scene shows a globe spinning and lightly talks about how ""one's small town is one's world"" - this version of Emma does a superb job showing this truth rather than telling. The ""small town"" feel is pervasive here and relatable. Emma as meddler made more sense: she is painfully bored, has limited friends (most of whom are quite silly), and is incredibly vain. The lavish food and set contribute to this feeling of bored vanity as well.The climax of the movie is well crafted and painful - and everything comes together at once. The Miss Bates incident is especially hard to watch and very personal here, and the conflict with Harriet feels more real and complicated than other versions.I also really enjoyed Mr. Elton - he is complete cringe but not over the top.Very enjoyable - 9/10"
25,"Wow! Why did I take so long to watch this gem! This new installment of the beloved romantic comedy Of Jane, Austin, is phenomenal!!! It has everything. I'll start with Anya Taylor-Joy. This young woman has proved that she can act; she has given Emma Wittiness charm And lovely character. The smart Screenplay has such a pleasure, funny liveliness, and tenderness to its characters encompass With such a fantastic music score. The direction of Autumn De Wilde is Excellent; every scene transpires the time era and the breathtaking cinematography is flawless, whether it is outdoors or in the set interiors are beautiful. The costuming is top-notch for the period. Emma is just lovely to watch. I'm hoping Oscar considers this beautiful film. One of the best of 2020."
26,"What a beautiful, gorgeously shot film. Like so many paintings.The score is also marvellous.We weren't hopeful and were so pleasantly surprised. Good script, great acting."
27,"This recent film rendition of Jane Austen's Emma (curiously here called ""Emma."" With a period) enjoyably carries the opulence of the 19th century landed gentry with a modernist modicum of biting satire. This vintage Austen is critical of the heavy-handed social manipulations toward marriage while it exudes Austen's own marriage to the time. As Virginia Woolf said, Austen ""had no wish for things to be other than they are.""Slyly played by Anya Taylor-Joy, Emma's major duty in life seems to be placing her loved ones in the right marriage, occasionally delighting in a working-class connection. To her credit she seems to value love even above wealth, though her being poor herself is never an option as long as her wispy father (Bill Nighy) is responsible for her welfare: ""Never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's."" (Emma)Taylor-Joy brings a sly smile to most interchanges, as if it were Austen herself enjoying the charades and deceptions that she knows her story will set right as she sets right the appropriate human connections. The audience is always in the know as young director
Autumn de Wilde gives the feel of Austen's signature style, Free Indirect Speech (FIS), a form of third-person narration which goes gently in and out of a character's mind.More importantly, the mansion and its grounds are about as lush and painterly as ever has been shown on a period piece, and the costumes are beyond breathtaking. If you are put off by the high rhetorical style, your eye will be fully satisfied with a sumptuousness rarely seen in cinema.When all is said, however, its live that defines this kind of romance. Johnny Flynn as George Knightly, Emma's close buddy and potential suitor, is real enough in a Steve-McQueen way to bring
that modernist cadence to the stiff upper-crust motif. He and Taylor-Joy are well matched, youthful, beautiful, and hip.De Wilde and writer Eleanor Catton have done Austen well, carrying the aura of 19th century upper-class reserve into our cynical times, attractive enough to make us think that love can be organized and life made simple. The women in Emma., even when foolish, are worthy of affection:""Men of sense, whatever you may choose to say, do not want silly wives."" Mr. Knightly"
28,"Austenites are some of the most difficult people to please when it comes to film adaptations, so I'm not surprised to see so many negative reviews. I too went into Emma feeling skeptical, but I gotta agree with the film critics on this one. Emma is not only a near perfect adaptation, but a breath of fresh air both in current cinema and in the Austen collection.The film is beautifully constructed overall. Amazing costumes, excellent cinematography, accompanied by gorgeous and memorable music.The character treatment and acting in this story was fantastic. I found all of the performances from the actors incredibly satisfying, even the interpretations that weren't my favorite. The character of Emma is such a dominant force in the story that it's easy for secondary characters to fall short or receive underdevelopment in the script. But each character receives dimension and personality. The cast makes all these characters feels like real humans from Emma to Mr. Woodhouse to Mr. Martin to the lowly foot men in the background (who are hilarious to watch on subsequent rewatches). Johnny Flynn brings both masculinity and sensitivity to his role as Mr. Knightly. And to those complaining about his scruffiness, those sexy sideburns of his are actually very historically accurate. Anya Taylor-Joy doesn't downplay Emma's snobbery or selfishness, which I love. Austen herself didn't intend Emma to be a likeable character, and it's so refreshing to see an adaptation that did not feel compelled to tone Emma down for audiences. Rich women of this time period did not have to be likeable, and it gives Emma a bigger character arc.While this film is full of the pastel, sugary sweet aesthetics one is used to seeing in Regency pieces, this is not a movie that unduly romanticizes the time period, but gives the town of Highbury a real dose of humanity and explores complex social issues while still being incredibly funny. It's not a sentimental film despite being a romantic comedy. The tone is completely different from the 1996 or 2009 versions of Emma, with a style reminiscent of Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette applied to a less grim tale. Which I'm personally okay with that. I'd rather see a version that brings something new to the table than just another rendition of the films we already have.Overall, Emma is an intelligent, charming, smart film that stands out in a in a time where the most popular movies are all remakes, slapsticks, sci-fis, sequels, superhero movies. It's so refreshing to see a film that is driven by character instead of by the plot or by spectacle. Even though I think too many of the same stories are being adapted for the big screen right now, if you're going to remake a classic, this is the way to do it: with something different and fresh from its predecessors."
29,Had me laughing and I also smiled till my cheeks hurt.. although I had to watch it twice to understand the old English dialogue...have since watched it more than that because I truly love this movie and the actors did an amazing job as it perfectly to me ..not seen any of the other movies from the franchise and not read the book but this was an interesting take of two nobles falling in love and so id highly recommend this movie as I give it a ten star!
30,"Funny script, good actors, loved the costumes and the shots"
31,"This is not good.
Casting issues : Mr Knightley should have been much older. It would have helped if the actors playing Frank Churchill and Mr Elton did not look like twins.
What was the weird Handmaid's Tale red cloaked girls about?
Worst thing was that Emma was so damned horrible that it was inconceivable that anyone would like her let alone want to marry her, she was vile!
Really odd soundtrack did not help. The whole thing was a total miss. Badly and lazily put together.
However, the best thing was Mirsnda Hart who was both funny and vulnerable, a touchingly tender performance."
32,"Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) is the fortunate daughter of Mr. Woodhouse (Bill Nighy) in jolly olde England. Now over eighteen, she has rejoiced in making a match for her former governess and watching them be happily married. It all goes to her head and she decides the best way to occupy her time is to make matches for all the unmarried folk around the area where she lives. Her brother-in-law, Mr. Knightley (Johnny Flynn) tries to warn her against this, especially when she turns her attentions to a young lady Miss Smith, who lives at a boarding house and has an unknown background. Indeed, Emma has encouraged Harriet Smith to turn down a man truly in love with the lass, Mr. Martin, and set her cap for the vicar, Mr. Elton. This upsets Mr. K greatly as he knows Mr. Martin well and believes it would have been not only a match of love but of equals. In due time, Mr. Elton seems to pay attention to Harriet but there may be an ulterior motive. Around the town, Emma also makes mistakes with old friends she finds boring and the secrets of the Weston family, where her former governess is now the lady of the house. Thus, Mr. Knightley is quite severe on Emma at times and tries to keep her out of trouble. Could it be that Mr. K himself as a secret love for someone? This absolutely gorgeous new version of Austen's timeless classic is a great pleasure to behold. What fantastic sets, costumes, and art direction! Your eyes will nearly fall out of your head at its opulence. The cast is mostly unknown but quite fine; Taylor-Joy brings Emma to life with gusto. My only quibble is Mr. Flynn doesn't measure up to my expectations; he's not handsome enough and doesn't have the polish Jeremy Northam had in an earlier version. There is quite a surprising scene or too, with a gentleman's naked backside revealed! Nevertheless, no matter how many times you have seen this story on film or re-read the book, this stunning new addition has earned the right to be considered one of the best."
33,"***One small spoiler***I had not planned to watch this because I really hated the Gwynneth Paltrow version. I wasn't sure if it was not liking her or just not liking the story. But my mom wanted to watch it so I indulged and watched it with her. I really enjoyed it. I didn't recognize the actress who played Emma but I enjoyed her performance. But the set design and costuming was incredible. In every scene my mom and I both found ourselves saying ""oh I love that chair!"", or ""that wallpaper is beautiful!"" And the clothes were beautiful and I loved the music. So that was the part of the movie I enjoyed the most. It was fun to watch. Plus the story and acting was really good. I also loved the first kiss between Harriett and Mr Martin. That was probably the sweetest first kiss I've ever seen in a movie. Anyway I really enjoyed the movie."
34,"I loved almost everything about this adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Visually it is a delight. The use of mature trees in parkland is spectacular. I did wonder why everyone's property had been given an upgrade - Donwell Abbey is surely not Pemberley and Miss Bates' poky apartment could not really have had old tapestries on the wall - but these do not detract from the viewer's pleasure.When I saw it, a woman walked out as soon as she saw Jonny Flynn as Mr Knightley - she was making a big mistake. He looked like a much more credible marriage partner for Emma than some of the older men we have seen in the part. It was an intelligent and sensitive reading: a revelation to have his emotion and frustration so clearly presented.Anya Taylor-Joy looked wonderful. Her facial expressions were finely tuned and mesmerising to watch, particularly as she began to be jealous of possible rivals for Mr Knightley's regard.The costumes and the jewellery were a visual delight: so many lovely outfits. Pacy, upbeat music and constantly changing scenes all sustained the interest.I'm amazed that anyone could have been bored by this production: It is just so funny, apart from anything else I wanted to watch it again as soon as it had finished. It will be a runaway success as a dvd."
35,I loved the clothes and the setting. Both stunning. Acting awful. Whoever did casting needs to retire and not faithful to the book at all. If it was supposed to be a comedy it failed! What the hell was the nosebleed for. Watch the bbc versions and the Gwyneth Paltrow version. Both much much better
36,"A perfectly put-together period. piece, slickly subtle yet sizzling in its sensuality (those looks shared at the dance!) and humour (chatty Miss Bates is an obvious highlight, but spineless Mr. Elton is another) as wonderful cinematography, performances, and script unravel the story's web of relationships centered on the beguiling Emma. With all the pomp and privilege on display though (not to mention the tidy pairing-off in the end), a little more bite and blood would've been welcome.
7.5/10"
37,It picked out the major themes of the book and stressed them . It gave us an insight into the regency world . It was beautifully filmed . All the main actors performed well . The two that were not right seemed to be Emma's sister and her husband . Still it is the best version I have seen of Emma and I loved it .
38,"This film will cure your insomnia and send you to sleep within 30 minutes, was very slow and acting felt like they were performing a pantomime"
39,"Took too long to get started and once it did it consisted of Anya Joy Taylor mugging and looking at the camera desperately seeking to be the new it girl. Fail. I loved the book and the nuance of the mini series. But it feels like the director, whom I shall never watch again was trying to combine Sofia ""Got to make a movie because my daddy is famous"" Coppolas awful Marie Antoinette with Baz ""Hey I add modern music to every period film I do because it worked once"" Luhrmans garbage fire Moulin Rouge. Give this a pass."
40,"I don't have many things to say abot this film because throughout the whole film I was simply entranced by how BEAUTIFUL AND HISTORICALLY ACCURATE ALL THE COSTUMES WERE ???? It's so rare nowadays to see period dramas stick to the period they're portraying with out trying to modernise it to make it appeal more to the modern audience, and I really need to applaud Emma for that, if it doesn't get an Oscar in costume design this year I'll genuinely be tremendously disappointed.Other than that the movie was quite good on itself as well, I loved how they kept the more witty spirit of Jane Austen's novel, which is so often lost in adaptation in favour of a more polished, romantic result."
41,"After the mixed ratings, I didn't expect too much and was pleasantly surprised. In fact, while the Kate Beckinsale version still is firmly my favourite, this one is definitely worth watching and rewatching and probably my next favourite adaptation after the one with Beckinsale (I thought the miniseries with Romola Garai beautifully filmed but in the end strangely forgettable; I do like Emma Approved but it obviously stands apart as a modern-day reimagining).There are, I admit, some major negatives:
1) The over-the-top comic moments, such as loud squealing and yelling. It isn't funny, just annoying.
2) Frank and Jane are sidelined completely, so there is almost nothing of the ship tease between Emma and Frank or of Emma's envy of Jane.
3) Isabella. Oh dear, Isabella. First Emma Approved turns John abusive, and now this adaptation goes the other way and turn Isabella into a cartoonish parody of Mrs. Bennet. I understand the need to flesh out their characters, but it surely can be done without turning them unnecessarily villainous.
4) Johnny Flynn gives a generally good portrayal of Mr. Knightley, but:
a) his character is way too hysterical in most of the dramatic moments;
b) the stripping scene. It's not just that it was entirely gratuitous. There's simply a thing called an establishing character moment. In the 1997 ITV adaptation, the first we see of Mr. Knightley is him greeting a servant like a friend and asking about his family. Here, the first we see of Mr. Knightley is him being undressed by servants whose presence he doesn't even acknowledge.And now for the positives:
1) Emma's actress. Anya Taylor-Joy utterly nails it, managing to capture all the many sides of Emma's nature and her character development.
2) Harriet actually seeing that Emma loves Mr. Knightley herself and calling her out on her actions. Quite refreshing for a character who usually behaves like a sheep ready to be led wherever offered.
3) Emma apologising to Robert Martin in person (she insists on doing it herself instead of delegating the task to Mr. Knightley!) and giving him her sketch of Harriet. This was a really sweet idea.
4) Emma and Harriet's friendship as a whole. For once, it felt more like a genuine friendship than merely like Emma patronising her new project.
5) The romance arcs of Mr. Knightley/Emma and Robert/Harriet. In my opinion, both of them were depicted very charmingly.
6) In particular: Mr. Knightley and Emma stealing a moment to be alone together by hiding behind a screen on the pretext of hiding from drafts. Aw.
7) The costuming and the scenery, both gorgeous."
42,"""The book was better"" is the battle cry of the benighted owl critic who fails to read these four simple words: ""Based on the book."" Cinema is not meant to be literature clones. I have read EMMA twice, and it really can't be done in the same time as the movie. . Movie makers of films like ""The Tudors,"" ""Rome"" and ""Emma"" would say (and have said) their intent is AUTHENTICTY and NOT accuracy. If accuracy were the goal, it'd be like some French flicks: long, dull, lots of dialog and not much action, in B&W, and no subtitles. Authentic cinema treats the viewer to inspiring interiors, lavish landscapes as only the British can do them, and cleavage-tempting costuming. For the price of admission or Netflix contracts, the viewer expects to be entertained, not read to. So put on your rose-colored glasses, ye rigid readers, and ENJOY THE SHOW!"
43,"Beautiful period piece with love and charm throughout! So delightful the way everything is set up, I love Anya Taylor Joy she's a wonderful actress in any project. Elegance of great magnitude and tranquillity. Emma deserves better/more appreciation; I'm barely a fan of period pieces but this is definitely among the best."
44,"This movie is everything I was looking for. While maintaining an interesting and somewhat risqué take on the Jane Austen novel ""Emma"", the film also manages to carry out well written dialogue and the clear character development of Emma. The movie wasn't necessarily throwing jokes around, on the contrary, all of the comedic effect was down to the timing of certain shots and lines and the contradiction of having to stick to a strict form when it comes to this era, almost showing how people in this time were just as human as us, and that is enlightening and hilarious.Although most regency era films stick to warm, earthy, neutral tones (which is valid and perfectly fine) this version of Emma decides to take on the more fashion forward and vibrantly coloured side of this era while still embracing the nature of the land, and succeeded (you see this with flowers in the hair, when appropriate, on the dresses, on the wallpaper etc. and still embracing white as one of the main colours in clothing). As well as the actors giving highly convincing, heartfelt and comedic performances, the costume design is extremely talented and manages to also pull the story together with the portrayal of certain characters' hierarchy. In order for historically creative costumes to work in films and still feel accurate, they need to have the correct silhouette of the time, this way the designer can experiment with the design and director's eye while still maintaining structure.In this film's case they manage to do all of this (including using the correct and complicated layerings and stays) and were inspired by actual past clothing designs to base some of their costume's off, while also including their own intricate textures, grounding the movie and making it more fitting for the time. Accessories were a big part of the time, especially if you were rich, and it is the little details of the hats, or gloves, or hair and even fans which tie this movie together.While Emma is obviously with the times, when it comes to her clothes (we even see her changing clothes throughout the day), her friend Miss Anne Taylor, isn't as fashion forward as Emma, at the beginning. However, as the movie progresses and we see her spending more time with Emma, we see her style mature and become somewhat more high-end. While most of these movies are afraid to embrace the lovely front curls in fear of it making the actors ""less attractive"", Emma shines as it refuses to hold back. This leads me to one of the most fascinating performances in the film, from Tanya Reynolds portraying Mrs. Elton. Considering this character travels around Europe, the designers made sure to make her outfits stand out in an exaggerated and comedic, yet stylish way. Her character sticks out more due to her different clothing, which what the other characters might view as odd at times or too much, establishes her character more. This is done especially, through the use of the Apollo knot, because although this was used mainly in the mid 1820s, it was carefully used in order to show how influenced by the latest European fashion she is, and to reflect how ridiculous her character is when contrasted to the other more traditional characters. I highly recommend this film (I have seen it 6 times already)."
45,"It's a weird romance story in the 1800s in England. It's a weird synergy but somehow that made it more realistic. It has several funny moments and even though the screenplay is not a masterpiece like Pride and Prejudice, I think it's a good alternative. At least, I enjoyed it quite a lot."
46,"Emma was well acted, funny, authentic and beautiful. I enjoyed it very much. Anya Taylor Joy is an amazing actress, all actors were really good,perfect casting. The cinematography was perfect, the costumes, the detail, the music all were really good. I can't understand the bad reviews, don't be discouraged by them."
47,"This movie is a good one that is worth watching!
The dialogue is a bit weak, but it has good actors.
I think this film can win this year's Academy Awards."
48,"I was so completely surprised by how much I enjoyed this version! I had heard many negative remarks. But after my niece's told me they loved it, I had to watch it! A lovely way to spend 2hrs on a rainy Sunday!"
49,"A beautiful execution of brilliant cinema.
I heven't read the book this movie was adapted from, but the film in itself is fantastic. I hope critics will critic this movie focusing on it's many merits, and not using the book as a yardstick."
50,"This film really surprised me. I expected boring local story about love. I was wrong. Firstly, the plot is interesting, it shows lifes of young men and women, their emotions and inner experience, it happens in the middle of 19th century in England. Characters are wonderful, I really like Emma and her friends. Secondly, the cast is great, Anya Taylor-Joy is a brilliant of film.
So, it's funny romance film."
51,"I hate period piece movies, so while sitting into my place I implored the Gods for a merciful and quick death, since They hadn't (evidently) been able to spare me the whole experience...And you can imagine how surprised I was when I realised that the movie was made with absolute good taste, excellent actors and perfect direction: I couldn't take my eyes from the gowns (and the suites), the houses, the lawns, the landscapes... an uncommon and really impressive care for details.And music definitely contributed to give a joyful and playful vibe to the movie, which I found more than appropriate: a divertissement, as they say in France.Best line? ' If I loved you less (then) I might be able to talk about it more...': According to me one the finest accounts for men shyness ever written (and one of Jane Austen's best lines...).One last thought: why the dot? (Emma.) Is it because this is meant to be the ultimate version of the Novel? Well, it would be fine for me..."
52,"Very good movie, well written, filmed, played, everything. This is easily a solid 8 instead of a 6.8. Very recommended."
53,Like many Jane Austen fans I have seen all the adaptations and actually enjoyed this more than any of the previous ones. Costumes and sets were exquisite but I also enjoyed the portrayal of relationship between Emma and Mr Knightley. I have.always found the character of Emma annoying but actually I had more empathy with this version of the character.
54,"I'm a big Anya Taylor-Joy fan, and the trailers looked good, so i was pretty excited for this movie...and not only did it meet my high expectations, but exceeded them as well. It's pretty rare for a movie to do that. The cinematography, costume design, acting, and directing are all fantastic, and of course the dialogue is good it being a Jane Austen novel. There's very little, if anything wrong with this movie and I would highly recommend it."
55,"Compared to the other Emma films that have been made, this is a drag, fell asleep in the cinema."
56,"This was the last movie my wife and I saw in the actual theater-- back in March 2020 -- just days before covid-19 lockdown began. As of July we're wondering when we'll ever get to see another. In the meantime we've acquired a big UHD TV and subscriptions to a bunch of streaming services. But there's still nothing to match watching on a big screen with a packed audience of engaged viewers.Anyway: long before there was ""Mean Girls"" and ""Clueless"", there was Jane Austen's novel about a good-hearted but manipulative, un-self-aware young woman who has a great deal of learning to do about real people. This most recent version of ""Emma"" is very nice and certainly worth seeing in whatever format. I think it's neither better nor worse than the good 1996 version (the one with Gwyneth Paltrow in the title role) -- they both have fine production values and fine casts, just different emphases, shadings of the various characters, and the choices for cuts made to the story to make it fit into a normal 2-hour run time. Anya Taylor-Joy is not only a good, distinctively featured young actress but she also *looks* as young as Jane Austen's heroine is intended to be, about age 20. She has the (often baseless) self-confidence arising from a privileged, untroubled upbringing, but a journey of self-discovery awaits her, and that's what makes the story.Other standout characters include Mia Goth, who plays friend/protegee Harriet Smith as even more of a hapless stooge than usual; and the incomparable Bill Nighy as Emma's father Mr. Woodhouse. Is he really just a hypochondriac always fussing over cold drafts and fireplaces? It becomes clear that he knows and sees a good deal more than his loving but blithely unobservant daughter gives him credit for. And Nighy can steal scenes without saying a word, just by body posture and a raised eyebrow. He's a cinematic treasure. Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley is fine but a bit forgettable in the end.And the scenery. It's so lush and green and bright that you have to consciously shake yourself to realize that no, the English countryside is really NOT always warm and sunlit as it is here. But this is fiction, and it just helps us settle in and enjoy the comfortable ride through this classic tale. For the best screen version of Emma out there, though, I happily recommend the 2009 TV miniseries starring Romola Garai. She's perfect for the part, and its 4-hour length lets the full story expand and breathe the way it should."
57,"I think what I love the most about this adaptation is that it seems to feel no need to apologise for some of Emma's behaviour. Austen wanted a heroine who was not very easy to like and that is exactly what we've got here. This film, just like the book, shows the progression of the character, Emma certainly learns a lot within the year!
Unfortunately with any film adaption of a full length novel, there must be some deviation, either bits missed out or amalgamated. Despite this, the film managed to capture the spirit of the book, something that, in my opinion, no other film or tv serious has managed to do.
I enjoyed the fact that the romance is ramped up compared to the novel, but thankfully this was done without sacrificing any of the comedy.
Well worth a watch!"
58,"Based on a timeless novel Emma by Jane Austen, this latest movie adaptation of her book is a beautiful, gorgeous and entertaining re-make that should easily please Austen fans old and new as it looks phenomenal. Its cast, led by the terrific and wonderful Anya Taylor-Joy, are/is utterly splendid. ""Emma's"" script is adapted by novelist Eleanor Catton (The Luminaries) and manages to capture much of Austen's own comedy, translating it elegantly to the screen. The result is a stylish and eminently watchable movie adaptation. In addition to the script, the production values are stellar, while movie is visually stunning and impeccably researched - it really felt like an authentic window into the 1800s. At the end, film - updated in all the right ways - is filled with an abundance of genuine charm. For those who are fans of the period drama this is a must see, while this gentle film, also, deserves to introduce Austen to a whole new generation.Rating: 7+/8-"
59,"I had really been surprised. This film includes modern notion of the old classic. Even mor actor Johnny Flynn is not only an excellent actor, but also author and singer of some of these wonderful songs! Kudos! All those who say it's slow or dull. We live in such fast world that we forget that there were times when letters came after weeks. To see your relatives took almost never when one married just some miles away... Enjoy the slow!"
60,"A wonderfully made movie for people who know and love this classic story. The actors, the scenario, the houses, the furniture, nature, and the sceneries are breathtaking. It may not please all audiences, but I am sure people like me who like buried and deep emotions depicted by a watercolor painting-like camera would agree with my rating."
61,"By far the best adaptation so far! I don't understand the low/negative reviews. The acting was wonderful, the set and costume design perfection and the humour was spot on. The actors portrayed the characters exactly as they should be from the book. And if you are actually paying attention to all the little subtle moments between the 'smaller' characters going on BEHIND the leads you see so much more story happening. A beautiful film and I truly loved it."
62,"Emma is a spoiled little rich girl living a parochial existence in a rural backwater where she leads society, such as it is - according to Jane Austen's text.
She is bored but insufficiently educated or naturally intelligent to find something useful to do, so meddles rather dangerously in peoples' lives.
The film takes this unpromising material and makes a true comedy from it - the italianate 18th C style operatic music underlining her walk down the corridor telling you right from the start that this is an artifice, a game, an entertainment - And I was very entertained.
Anya Taylor-Joy has the perfect little ""cat that got the cream"" face and Johnny Flynn's Queen Bee song over the end credits tells us that she has has indeed got all the cream to be had.
The Gypsy Rose Lee reversé that Johnny Flynn undertakes is amusing. Never has a male leg looked so seductive with a stocking being drawn up it.
Another enjoyable moment was the introduction of Mrs Elton dressed as a wasp and (gasp) occupying the front pew. Incidentally Mr Knightley seems to spare himself church-going duties - one of those new-fangled deists perhaps?
Read this film as an ironic divertisement - a confection for your pleasure."
63,"All adaptions from books to film are going to have things left out, things added, and a slightly different take on the source material.I have seen every Jane Austen adaption there is, and they all bring a different colour to the stories. This one is beautifully done. For those that don't like any variation from the novel, read the novel!"
64,"Pros:
1. The comedy is sharp and witty and produces many wonderful character interactions.
2. Anya Taylor-Joy (Emma Woodhouse), Mia Goth (Harriet Smith), Josh O'Connor (Mr. Elton), and Johnny Flynn (Mr. Knightley) give brilliant performances.
3. The set and costume design are utterly mesmerising. The costume design, in particular, is exceedingly colourful to cement the bright and light-hearted tone.
4. The score and soundtrack does an amazing job at adding bounce and energy to the film. The last song, 'Queen Bee' by Johnny Flynn, beautifully rounds off the movie as well.
5. The cinematography is gorgeous. It's well-shot and visually stunning.
6. There is fantastic chemistry between Anya Taylor-Joy and Mia Goth, as well as between Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn.
7. The ending is suitably heartwarming and satisfying. It ties up the plot and sub-plots nicely.Cons:
1. The dialogue is, at times, a little pretentious and forced.
2. Most of the love triangles, for the most part, are poorly developed and don't feel genuine at all."
65,"The music provides a telling structure in Autumn de Wilde's adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. In particular, there's a difference between the music that originates within the narrative - i.e., the songs and music performed by the characters within the plot - and the outside music - i.e., the score that frames the narrative. The outer reflects upon the inner. This strategy points to the drama's central concern with the class structure, its privileges and its responsibilities.
The internal music is classical, whether symphonic or traditional lyricism. That is, it represents the upper middle class - better educated, richer, in short, privileged - which the wealthy and beautiful Emma rules with her assumed sense of power.
Arguably the key song is the Knightley/Fairfax duet of ""Drink to me only with thine eyes,"" a period re-setting of the Elizabethan Ben Jonson's ""To Celia."" Popular in Jonson's day, it's classical in Austen's (and in ours, as even Johnny Cash has visited it with gritty ardour).
In addition to the charm of its performance, the song serves a key thematic function. It initially suggests the singers' romantic pairing. This is what Emma assumes, while she nurses the romantic possibility of the mysterious Frank Churchill. Ms Fairfax has already trumped Emma with a brilliant piano solo that outshone Emma's song. But we eventually learn Fairfax and Churchill have long been engaged. Emma and Knightley happily graduate from their compulsive antagonism into love.
The ironies around this performance of the Jonson song undermine Emma's confidence in her own judgment, especially as she contrives marital matches. Also, as the song portends, it is through their eyes - fixed upon each other as they dance - that the, climactic love between Knightley and Emma takes hold.
Their dance is a pairing within a collective dance. Their intimate harmony is thus a part within a larger group harmony. This contrasts to the other pairings that would challenge the social order, like Emma's plan to join Harriet, the woman of unknown (hence inferior) origins, to the respectable but ludicrous Mr Elton (a prospect he indignantly, snobbishly rejects) and Harriet's subsequent design upon Knightley.
In contrast, the songs that frame the narrative from outside are traditional folk tunes, i.e., the songs of the lower class. That is, this drama of the upper class is framed by, set in the context of, the life and liveliness of the lower class, the ever-present but ignored servants and farmers.. This is the music of the good Mr Martin, the farmer whose appropriate engagement to Harriet Emma thwarts, presuming for her companion to marry above her station. As her governess did.
Their intimate service is exemplified when a servant puts the bare forked Knightley into trousers. Otherwise Knightley is the film's moral center because he respects and attaches to the working class. In his noblesse oblige, he feels responsible to the class that serves him. He spurns the carriage to travel the countryside on foot. He properly criticizes Emma for thoughtlessly insulting the social inferior, Mrs Bates. He gallantly - a Knightley in shining armour - rescues Harriet by asking her to dance after Elton has flagrantly rejected her. His love ultimately redeems Emma.
When Emma is twice forced to apologize to her social inferiors in both cases it is by generous visits. To pay her new respect to Mrs Bates Emma brings her a basket of flowers. Her very appearance is her apology, as Mrs Bates gratefully resumes praising Emma's goodness, glossing over her evident hurt. To Mr Martin Emma brings another basket, with a generous goose, and an encouraging articulation of her regret for having interfered with his proposal to Harriet. Harriet and Mr Martin eventually rush to each other with the unbridled enthusiasm of a village ditty.
In song as in life, the upper middle class may have the polish but the lower has the energy."
66,"Funny! And I really enjoyed the characters, especially Emma, Knightley and Emma's father. I highly recommend it."
67,"This adaptation of Emma looks like none of Jane Austen's work so far transformed into a movie or TV series, and yet it is one of the most fabulous things I've ever seen. Of course, if you learnt every of her novels by heart and take the romantic pathos all too seriously, I am not surprised you should hate this version. I had read the book before I watched the movie and I was happy to see that almost everything matches the original plot and the rest is even better. It is a lovely, clever and genuinely fresh comedy and if you don't cling too much to previous versions of Emma, you discover that the camera, music, beautiful locations and perfect actors have done absolutely great work. The characters like Mr Woodhouse, Ms Bates or Mrs Elton were exaggerated into the exact funny creatures I pictured them to be and they brought the exact dose of sarcasm to the story that we all needed. Once again I fell in love with Johnny Flynn, who is so much underrated it causes me pain. The friendship between Emma and Mr Knightley was very well shown and its transformation to love at the ball scene was so beautifully arranged that it makes me smile even days after watching the movie. Although the movie lacks some of the important details from the book, which had to be missed because of shortness of time, it does not make the movie any less interesting.
Long story short - if you are Austen's devoted fan through and through and you feel the need to enthuse about every time Mr Knightley dreamily looks at Emma, you'd rather not watch this version. However, if you enjoy a splendid filmmaking, which this new Emma certainly is, with all its clever wit, do not hesitate to watch it. We did not know what we missed until we were shown this marvelous and unique peace of artwork."
68,"LOVED IT, so unexpectedly funny!! I'm also glad there was no political agenda in there about female empowerment or other useless junk, they stuck to book and therefore they get high praise from me!"
69,Sublime and far superior to previous versions. Bill Nighy steals every scene he's in.
70,"I love Austen but this film is a wonderful experience even though not a faithful adaptation. The first time I saw it was because I was intrigued by the trailer. The remaining three times were because it was so rich in delights, I needed more viewings to take them all in, especially the character development, the music, and the many subtle sight gags. I also wanted to see how many clever references to previous Austen films I could spot. For example, look closely at the set of Emma's drawings when she spreads them out on the table. I can't wait to own both the film and the sound track."
71,"We loved this movie! The actors do a great job balancing the sensibility of the 1800's society with humor over its absurdity. High marks to the director and screenwriter for capturing Emma's author, Jane Austen, so beautifully. As much as we enjoyed character portrayals, we equally loved the scene design, costumes, location settings and staging. There are numerous scenes that show subtle touches of romances blossoming, especially a dance sequence at a ball held for visiting son Franklin Churchill. And overall, there is the fun the audience gets from watching an abundance of communication miscues and their consequences. Last, but not least, Emma actress and several other characters had very large eyes which we get to see express so much suppressed emotion that reflect the times."
72,"An average story played out badly at an interminably slow pace. Unfathomable screenplay. Claustrophobic interiors. Un-engaging exteriors. Anya Taylor-Joy was not an Emma and was unwatchable. Bill Nighy was Bill Nighy (snort, twitch head, twitch shoulder, sideways look), Miranda Hart was Miranda Hart (manic laugh, silly voice, sillier walk). This is not a comedy. There wasn't a single funny moment, witness the well attended cinema with an apparently broad demographic barely raising a smile throughout. (It was more interesting watching them than the film). I want to forget this ever happened!"
73,"I love Emma. The book, the previous adaptations, Clueless... yes, that was modern Emma. But this film felt hollow. The pacing and the vibrance of the characters were so off. What a waste of Bill Nighy. I love him so much, and Gemma Whelan as well... and a few others, but someone *cough* the director *cough* tried way too hard at making this film different and ""quirky"" compared to the others, he forgot the soul of it."
74,"This interpretation of Emma is hands down my favourite. It holds true to all the important and celibrated aspects of Jane Austen's novel, while injecting a fresh and very entertaining air into the classic story."
75,"Not funny at all, most characters are dull, unlikable, or boring.
There was very little dialogue that it could have been a silent movie.
The music and costuming was excellent.
I did like Bill Nighy as Mr. Woodhouse."
76,"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich. I recently watched the 1996 version with Gwyneth Paltrow in the leading role to get an idea of the story of the film going into this one. I love Anya Taylor-Joy so much. I've seen every one of her films apart from Marrowbone. I was so excited to see her in yet another period piece but this time in a sly comedy. I ended up really enjoying this film. Its got laughs, love, class, and even a deft touch of sadness.
The film is about a a wealthy 21 year old girl named Emma, who meddles in the lives of those around her. She tries to set her friend up to a man she is not romantically attracted to. As time goes by Emma discovers that trying to fix peoples lives does not always work and then she herself becomes romantically inclined. Along the way Emma realizes how manipulative and haughty she is and the impact that it has on those who are around here. The film also stars Mia Goth, Johnny Flynn, and Bill Nighy.
The attention to detail and the production and costume design are absolutely superb. The film is rich with its intricate detail to period and the nobility involved. The film also possesses vibrant cinematography and camerawork. Its a really nice film to look at in a technical aspect. Anya Taylor-Joy is a talent and she's fantastic in this role. Emma can be despicable at times but there's an allure to her character and you can not help but want to be around her. The performances all around are great. I love seeing Mia Goth getting meaningful work, and I've never seen Bill Nighy have such a keen eye for a chilly draft.
The film just seems more attuned and in sync with Austen's novel than the 1996 version. It embodies a wide range of emotions and can be hilarious with no dialogue at all. The cast have good chemistry and Autumn de Wilde shows a great touch in her impressive directorial debut. I think this film was great fun and is something I want to check out again because I found great (Anya Taylor) joy watching this.
The best part of my night though without a doubt is actually meeting the leading lady on the street after the premiere. She was present for a live Q and A and overall this was quite the experience. I am in heaven!"
77,"The historical touches to this film are brilliant. The costumes and the silent bustling servants in the background are fabulous, and add so much to the ability to immerse oneself in the scenes and the story. A great way to introduce Austen's world to those who have not yet discovered the book."
78,"This Movie is absolute Masterpiece. Every Frame is well crafted, every dialogue is well delivered. Loved the movie."
79,"I delayed watching this, I expected another Luvvie fest that we usually get with this title; Bill Nighy was the reason I eventually viewed it. What an excellent surprise - it's snappy, it's bright and amusing with a perfect cast and Bill Nighy stole the show with about 6 lines in total. I understand this is a first feature for the director Autumn de Wilde; hope there is more in the pipeline. The styling was stunning. Good job by all involved"
80,"I was reading some of the other comments and I must say. This version, or cast to be exact, is in my opinion perfect.
I watched BBC miniserie and 1996 version again. And i must say I like this cast the most. Emma in miniserie is just to soft and her transformation is just not it.
Even Gwyneth is i don't know somehow not the right one. Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect Emma, high and mighty in the beginning and her transformation to soft and a woman in love is awesome.
Also Mr. Knightley. Their crosses are so vivid, their dance.. Omg, i was missing that tension in previous adaptations. You can just feel it.And also mr. Knightleys scowl after the picnic. Brilliant. Before I just found them dull, not powerful enough.And the best.. Their declaration of love. YES!!! His desperation when he still thinks she's in mourning for mr. Churchill... And hers when she thinks he's in love with either Jane or Harriet.
And then his sort of happy jump after he sees she's accepting him. Brilliant!I love Harriet's acting, mr. Woodhous's, mrs. Elton's, Jane's, ms. Bates's. Well, after watching all previous adaptations I definetly love this one the most. For me this is Jane Austen.Well yes, as it is a movie some of the parts are missing, but that is to be expected.And costumes and scenery. Emma's white and green dress for the proposal scene. I would wear that one 😍"
81,"This movie is tragically underrated. I've never thought it fair to judge a movie by its alignment with ""the book.""In its own right, Emma is a wonderful movie. I watched it for the first time last week, and I've watched it probably a dozen times since...liking it more with each viewing.Throughout the movie, Emma teeters on the fence between childish indulgence and true nobility, and it's satisfying to see the character develop. The love story, too, is captivating...carried along on the wings of a beautiful soundtrack.Make more movies like this."
82,"I've never been a big fan of historical ""costume dramas"" as they tend to bore me. But to my surprise, Emma. is absolutely breathtaking. The entire cast is fantastic, but this is a perfect showcase for Anya Taylor-Joy's beauty, elegance, charisma and talent. Even though her character Emma Woodhouse is not perhaps the most likable character ever, Taylor-Joy's exquisite performance makes this movie by far the best historical drama I've ever seen. There are, surprisingly, quite a lot of funny scenes - Bill Nighy is a welcome addition to the cast. Why can't all costume dramas be as good as this one?"
83,"Great costumes, set, casting! Did lack the warmth of the BBC mini series though. But it was totally unique and enjoyable."
84,"Devoured each of Jane Austen's books as a teen. Have since seen every Jane Austen film and mini series. This cheeky latest version did not disappoint. Thoroughly enjoyed the cast, cinematography and dialogue. Jane, I daresay, would approve of this adaptation."
85,"I'm a HUGE fan of Emma so I went and saw this the first chance I had (after what felt like an agonizingly long wait). I was not in any way disappointed.Like all of the other adaptions, De Wilde's version has its own unique charms. I don't need a 'definitive' version; as far as I'm concerned, the more of them the better as long as they each have something to offer - I'll watch them all, again and again. This was one offers quite a lot. I can think of a number of scenes that I can't wait to see again - scenes that are faithful to the story we already know and love but are not like what we have seen onscreen already.I have a few small nitpicks - several lines that were rushed/not given their full emotional weight; Mr. Woodhouse's bouncy energy; Mr. Knightley's a little too young (but the performance was fantastic); Emma being perhaps a little too cold; the pivotal romantic scene near the end was just not quite right, not quite strong enough - but nothing that would prevent me from giving it a 10/10.It's a funnier movie than the trailer suggests. I thought a lot of the jokes in the trailer fell a little flat but they fit much better into the movie itself and there were some other quite funny new moments.I don't think any fans of Emma should have any reservations about seeing this one."
86,"Emma: A new adaptation by Director Autumn de Wilde work from a script by Elanor Catton takes the Comedy of Manners/Drama road. Class is all important, to keep Emma's life on track a pyramid of servants is essential. Even when Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) is picking flowers for her departing governess (Gemma Whelan) she requires the assistance of a footman and maid. Her father (Bill Nighy) needs two servants to detect draughts and move screens for him. Even the younger males like George Knightley (Johnny Flynn) have valets to dress them from head to foot.Emma's matchmaking entangles her in all sorts of mishaps as she misinterprets signals and her schemes to form unions between people of the right sort for them crumble into chaos. Knowing ones place is all important but so is noblesse oblige. A lesson she learns when she encounters the Godotesque (and cruel) Frank Churchill when he finally arrives. An entertaining two hours. 8/10."
87,"I loved watching this version of Emma! The costumes and sets were absolutely breathtaking. The casting was perfection. Anya Taylor Joy as Emma was fantastic- her little glances, movements, head tilts, she was way better than Gwyneth Paltrow. The romantic tension between Emma and Knightly was electric, I could feel Jane Austen coming to life. This was a much needed escape from reality to enjoy two hours about matchmaking in a time when people didn't have much else to occupy their time. It was lovely cinema. Highly recommend."
88,I'm not usually a fan of period films nor am I an avid reader of Jane Austen yet everything in this film just clicked perfectly the time flew by i was having so much fun and if anything I was left wanting it to carry on rather than end. A truly magnificent film.
89,"I love costume movies and Swarovski jewellery in this movie. Like the story I think Johnny Flynn was very good,remember him from the "" Beast"""
90,"Absolute bore, fell asleep twice and walked out. Felt like an endless loop of waiting for something to happen. Have read the book but this was hard to get through"
91,"The only memorable elements in this film
Are the sets, the cinematography, and the recurring
Images of Ms Goddards school girls.
The rest is like watching paint dry. It moves way too slow. It's uneven. Is it comic ? It's more straight with
Comic accents in all the wrong places. That is the impression it left me with. Yes, I felt the Novel prose was overwhelmingly misunderstood , given this screenplay. For this to really work you must like Emma and Mr. Knightley. I didn't I didn't care about either.
Total waste of Bill Night's talent as well. ( I hope he got paid well) It's ultimately a forgettable version.
The 1996 film still does the better job of hitting all the bullet points while keeping even pacing and consistent blending of spirit of the novel with playful creative liberties. I think this 2020 adaption will bore those not familiar with Jane Austen's works , and divide those that are familiar."
92,"This initially seemed promising.However after half an hour the film started to drag.Pointless scene followed pointless scene.I sat there hoping for something to happen,but really little did."
93,"I have always loved Emma! I loved the book. I loved the Masterpiece Theater version. I loved the 1996 version with Paltrow as Emma.I hated this.I hated Emma's character in this. Instead of loving her and cheering her on, I rather wanted a horse to run her over. Emma should be genuine and caring of others. This Emma was selfish and a complete snob. She only cared for herself. She was overtly judgmental. While Emma did display judgment in the other versions and in the book, it wasn't her constant character but rather a low point in her character development.I hated this Emma.I only gave it two stars for the costumes, which were very lovely."
94,"Honestly, of all the Jane Austen stories, the one that I've always had a difficulty fully relating to - especially in film- was Emma, but this film really changed me. Previously I had seen Emma's portrayals at the start only as spoiled, affected and self-centered, so I tough of her as an obnoxious and vane person, but here I saw more nuance from the start. Sure, her story is about how short sighted and full of herself she can be, but what really makes you root for her is realizing how sincere and caring she is with the ones she loves and how much she wants the best for them, wich is ultimately what's behind the things she does -however missguided they are-, and that really comes through in this film.
I truly feel a lot of care, sensibility and joy was put into the making of this film. So, I deffinitely don't think this a movie that places stetics over quality, as others have said, just the opposite. The filmmakers decisions are well suited for the fresh, intimate and feminine vision they had for Emma's world and add to the story, from the scenery and costumes, to the music and the way it's edited and shot, not to mention the brilliant acting and script. There is a lot of subtlety and wits to this movie, and it dares to be full of Anima, wich makes for a really interesting, endearing and fun wach, so I would absolutely recommend."
95,"I would caution any who would wish to criticise this adaption, lest they might appear to have missed the point entirely."
96,"I am a lover of all things Austen. I have seen so many different adaptations of all her books. For this one, I enjoyed all the new takes.For starters Bill Nighy's character of Mr. Wood's house is just the best thing! I love that he is just paranoid and not senile and that Isabella his daughter shares that trait.I could do without the interesting folk music. (This is the only reason it isn't getting a 10/10)I LOVE MIRANDA HART!I don't believe Jane Austen intended did Emma to be as mean as they portrayed her in this, but I kind of like it. It just makes more sense why Knightly criticizes her all the time.I absolutely love that Knightly runs to the Woodhouses after the dance! I was just so impressed and loved all the glances and the build-up of Emma and Knightlys relationship.The nose bleed scene was not expected, but that it was refreshing. It's enjoyable to watch adoption when you have no idea what will happen next.Keep an open mind and notice all the humor!"
97,"This version of Emma is just beautiful to watch! The photography, sets and costumes are of extreme beauty and the score also amazing! Actors are fantastic altho i didn't like that type of Emma which is very different from other versions such as the one with Gwyneth Paltrow. I thought this Emma was too vain and artificial and not very likeable really! i did not care for that actress altogether that much either. Otherwise, still a magic and very entertaining movie, the director did a very impressive work of her first movie!!!"
98,Really good fun. Quirky in a good way and just brilliant all round performances. Brilliant locations and the nod and a wink thrown in for good measure. Do you feel a draught?
99,"I couldn't help admiring the quirkiness of the decor, compared to a lot of other period dramas. I absolutely loved the way it was directed and edited, and Anya Taylor Joy was amazing. I read reviews saying that the movie was shallow, but so was the book. I couldn't help comparing this film to the one from the 90s with Gwyneth Paltrow, and I'd say that both are very good, but in such different ways. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves a good period drama."
100,"Visual perfection! Lovely performances - exquisite photography, each scene frame worthy."
101,"This movie it's about a lot of Rickh Families living with each other and having romantic interests with each other, it's a recipe for a bad and mossy movie, but, for me, it's pretty good and emotional. The way that the social relantionships are explained and interconnected it's great and you really fell all the things that each character pass and fell, the really great acting helps to achieve this. Also, the evolve of the main character it's very relatable, at least to me. It's a great movie that uses a silly premise to tell a great story, loved it."
102,"What an amazing remake, Jane Austen would have been proud! I think this is the best and most humorous version of ""Emma"". The timing and the sublime jokes. I laughed out loud constantly- as did the rest of the cinema audience. Bill Nighy as Mr Woodhouse alone is worth the ticket!"
103,"I found this adaptation produced with care and with nuisance that could be too easily missed and discounted. For me, this adaptation tells well the awakening of Emma to her own maturity within social roles and class within the structure of that time."
104,"Of all the Emma adaptations I've seen, this one really stands out by its beauty. _Everything_ about this move is beautiful -- from the story itself to acting and witty dialogue (with just the right amount of comedy), from the lush English countryside (almost always shot on sunny days) to England's exquisite manors and perfect period costumes, to folk choir songs and music. The two main characters are perfect for the role, with an excellent supporting cast. The story is beautifully retold, lighthearted, and uplifting. Exactly what you need if the pandemic has got you in tears. If the movie strays too much from the source material (I've read Emma so long ago that I don't even remember if it does or not), truthfully, it doesn't matter, because the movie has got everything else going for it.IMDB ratings were so bad that I almost decided not to bother watching Emma, but decided to give it a try after reading one user review that seemed pretty balanced, and I am so glad I did. You'll enter the world of Jane Austen as it was, in all its glory, and be rewarded with a feast for the eyes and the soul."
105,"This movie is a beautiful work of art, from the colours to the sets to the lavish costumes. The fact that is is all then heightened by a phenomenal cast is just the icing on the cake."
106,"My Review- Emma
My Rating 6.9Before she began the novel,Jane Austen wrote, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.""
Emma is spoiled, headstrong, and self-satisfied; she greatly overestimates her own matchmaking abilities; she is blind to the dangers of meddling in other people's lives; and her imagination and perceptions often lead her astray plus she is an awful snob.
This was the last of Jane Austen's novels to be published and completed in her lifetime.
Her last novel Persuasion was published posthumously after her death in 1817.This 2020 film version of Emma stars Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma Woodhouse and she is very good as the snobby control freak who is trying to play matchmaker to her friend Harriet Smith also played very well by Mia Goth.
The standout performance for me in this movie is Miranda Hart as Miss Bates as the kind hearted but overbearingly boring twittering Village spinster. Miranda Hart gives the character humour and colour and her performance is worth the price of seeing this good film.
The male characters in this predominantly female dominated story apart from Bill Nighy as the eccentric and delightfully self obsessed humorous father of Emma and Josh O'Connor as Mr Elton The Village Vicar seemed to lightweight to me .
The two romantic leads lacked charm and sex appeal to me Johnny Flynn as George Knightley looked a little scruffy and more suited to the role of Mr Robert Martin the good hearted farmer .Callum Turner also seemed lacking to me in his role as Frank Churchill the charming but deceitful potential suitor of Emma.
Perhaps that was the intention of Autumn de Wilde another impressive female director to avoid well known male stars from stealing the limelight from the
impressive women?
Top 10/10 marks to the Production personnel on this version of Emma it's a joy to watch the Cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt ,Production Designer Kate Quinn, Art Director Alice Sutton, Set Director , Stella Fox (who did ""Judy"" Star Wars Episode V11,) and especially Costume Designer ,Alexandra Byrne ( Phantom of the Opera and Mary Queen of Scots) who should be nominated next year for an Oscar.If you love the World of Jane Austen the frippery and foppery and that long lost past age of strict manners and snobbery of Georgian Society you're sure to love Emma .
I couldn't help comparing Emma to the other recent period film set 60 years ahead in America Greta Gerwig's stunning version of ""Little Women"" with a character Jo March also not looking for marriage but with more a woman of substance than Emma."
107,"Please take my review with a grain of salt. Period pieces/costume dramas are not really my thing. But I liked Gerwig's take on ""Little Women."" And the trailer for ""Emma."" had the energy of ""The Favourite.""If you're at all like me, and you are interested in this film because of that energy from the trailer, I'd like to tell you that you will he disappointed. This does not have any edge, nor much snark.There is nothing ""bad"" about this film at all. Maybe some of the editing and camera placement is odd, but I'm not subtracting points for that.But, what's the hook?I found nothing particularly special about this film. Sure, the costumes are nice, the music is sweet, and Taylor-Joy is solid. But there was nothing compelling. The saddest thing I could say here was:I felt nothing.I didn't laugh once. I was never shocked. I never got choked up. I didn't feel a single strong emotion for this whole film (not even a negative one like boredom or hatred).So I suppose that I find this film to be very forgettable. See it for yourself and ask yourself what's special about it. What will you remember a year from now?It's another English film with pomp and frills and everyone is romantically interested in one another. It would be easy to confuse this with so many other films."
108,"..in order to erase this 2020 mess from my head. Mr Knightly was constantly the underdog to Emma in this new version, and not the other way around as it should've been. His ""Badly done!"" fells flat as he has to deliver the line to Emma being positioned higher than him, in a wagon. And the nosebleed, really! And the ridicolous shirt collars.The film could be a musical - omit the lines and just keep music and there you have it. The music was fine but there was too much of it.I give some stars due to the some fine characters portraying e.g. Jane Fairfax - a quite likeable Jane in this version! And, although at first very strange to see Yara of the Iron Islands in a Jane Austen, her Mrs Weston very soon fits nicely into place."
109,"Emma. is a great period drama that's extremely eccentric, fun and charming. Anya Taylor-Joy is great as Emma and Johnny Flynn is also great. Bill Nighy, Miranda Hart, Mia Goth and Josh O'Connor are all really good. Autumn de Wilde's direction is fantastic and the film is beautiful throughout. The costumes are amazing and the music by Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer is excellent. It's also consistently funny although this undercuts the emotion in a couple of scenes."
110,"The movie is breathtaking with nearly every shot, as the cinematography captures some beautiful set design, giving a dream like state to each scene. I suggest that it's rather fitting to be dream-like considering Emma's constancy in matchmaking ideal men for her friend Harriet.Just as Austen's novel, the movie is genuinely funny, lightly pushing on the bounds of etiquette to have great comedic moments."
111,"I wasn't interesting at ALL. I originally LOVE Jane Austen's books and movies. But this? No. Me, and my four friends were extremely bored, i went out one time and almost fell asleep. This has NEVER happened before. The music was no good at all."
112,"This film is so utterly miscast. There is no chemistry bewtween Emma and Knightley, Emma is charmless, Knightley is generic, Frank churchill unappealing (just remember Ewan McGregor!) and the thing that Billy Nighy always does is somehow bland. A ruined classic."
113,"I found this movie feeling as long as its two-hour length, which with general good movies, should not be. It has such a queer, musical feel, though it is not a musical - as if the ""comedy"" in the movie all relies on the music. Much of the acting is wooden, and there are two unnecessary scenes of nudity (one only semi), which add nothing? I must agree with another comment - this is the most bizarre Emma adaptation, and one of the most bizarre movies I have ever seen."
114,"Nothing to see here. 1996 version with Gwynth Paltrow a better use of your movie-watching time. This seems like an obvious reaction to Greta Gerwigs' Little Women - classic Hollywood coattail riding (see Dante's Peak and Inferno). But alas, Autumn DeWilde is no Greta Gerwig. The fact they're both women is all they have in common. She cannot hold a candle to Greta as a storyteller. She is merely a band photographer who has no natural talent or academic acumen to backup her attempt to handle professional level movie production."
115,"Wow. This is not good. nothing is really good except the sets (and always Bill Nighy). It's very disjointed. Emma is un redeemable which I know is the arc of the movie but she was so black and white icky it's hard to root for her and knightly. And all of a sudden Knightly falls in love in one dance after knowing her for so long?? Most scenes jump cut so abruptly. One scene Harriet is somehow waling being carried by that rich guy Emma likes (Churchill??) with a hurt leg??? in the daylight but after the ball and was carried for miles??? Screaming about being in love...but then forever later in the movie - she mentions something about how that was just Gypsies???? Gypsies. A wild band of marauding Gypsies in the English country side in a jane Austin movie. So a wild band of Gypsies jumped their carriage and ....then Churchill carried her for 30 miles to...Emma's????? It's just so odd - it's hard to even know what is happening much less why. It's such a staggeringly simple story - not really sure how such an effort to make it an overly stylish unique version buried the sweetness of the story. The actors all do their part but it just doesn't track or make you care - Sense and sensibility and pride and prejudice have such a human through line. This is just ...well, weird.and $19.99 to rent in amazon! Ugh."
116,"Adaptation of Jane Austen's great book ever. Even if I overlook the badly followed timeline, I can not forgive the fact that Emma's character in the movie could not be further from her character in the book. She is portrayed as a nasty, cold and unfeeling woman in the movie, and there is no character development later at all. Her connection and chemistry with Mr Knightley is nonexistent, no trace of the witty and full-of-feelings conversations between them that I loved so much in the book. If you liked the book or the former movie adaptations, spare yourself from watching this one. It is a stark disappointment."
117,"A very unique, stylish movie. Sweet, but not cheesy. Emotional, but not pretentious sentimental. Amazing cinematography, original soundtrack, historically accurate costumes, great cast.
The chemistry between the leads creates the most believable portrayal of the Emma and Knightley's romance to date (here further emphasized by a Knightley who is in love with her from their first scene).I love the book and I read it more than once and for me, this movie really captures Austen's witty comedy and her satire about rich, privileged people (pay attention to the servants in the background for extra comedy!)
It also captures the essence of the characters without compromise.
Austen described Emma as a female character no one but her would like and I appreciate this movie for being courageous in that the titular character is like Austen herself wrote her, unlike other adaptations that try to make her too likeable. Emma isn't nice at the beginning (but she's funny) so Anya Taylor Joy is superb playing her exactly like she's supposed to, but it makes it even better when she evolves and you see that she's actually good and sweet but misguided by her privilege and naive self. After all, and that was the question Austen asked, why should a rich privileged girl like Emma be too nice from the start? She has to learn some things the hard way. Austen knew that the real struggle for the main character isn't saving the world from alien invasion: it's finding you aren't as good as you thought, it's making a rude comment at a party once and feel ashamed, it's realizing that you hurt people including the person you are in love with but didn't realize before because you took them for granted.
Also notable the portrayal of Johnny Flynn who gives us a very human, tender, earthy and sexy version of Mr Knightley that is all the more charming and layered because of that and might survive the test of time as a memorable adaptation of the character.Autumn De Wilde created a perfect world for these characters, almost too perfect and colorful to be real. This she constantly reminds you by allowing the characters to have strong human reactions that deliberately ruin that perfection over and over. This movie is subtle, choices are made that are more deliberate than what they seem and there is more depth that many would be willing to give it credit for or notice. It isn't a movie for everyone especially if you don't like period dramas or you only like the old fashioned way to make period dramas. Here you see a male character cry when he's happy and sad, you see the protagonist, someone who is incredibly poised and almost too perfect for the first part of the movie, get so overwhelmed by her feelings that her humanity makes the big romantic moment less sentimental than you'd expect but all the more sweet and real because of that . The reward for De Wilde's challenging our expectations of what a romantic period drama should be like is a comedy that never stops making you smile but also a satisfying and heartwarming ending with a sincere sweetness and tenderness that is healing in the depressing historical time we are living."
118,"Even though I'm no fan of Gwyneth Paltrow, this 2020 version cannot hold a candle to the 1996 adaptation. It's silly, too long and boring. And Mr. Knightley? Dear God, are there no good looking men left in England??? Theo James would have been perfect for this role! I love a good friends to lovers story, but detected no chemistry whatsoever between the characters of Emma and Mr. Knightley. None. The musical ""intermissions"" seemed out of place and out of period and jarred me out of the story. And the scene under the tree when Mr. Knightley finally confesses his love, a nosebleed? Seriously? WTH? Oh, and the character of Mr. Martin? He just seemed like a wooden bufoon. The final scene had me rolling my eyes. I'm glad I did not go to see this in theatres. Do yourself a favour and watch the 1996 version."
119,"As a fan of 18th and 19th century England I lovd the fantastic production and accuracy of this film.
This is a subtle story. Not for those who prefer in your face dialogue. Gentle and lovely. But not for everyone...sadly."
120,"This iteration of Emma is one of the best adaptations on Jane Austen's works to date. I rate with 1995 Pride and Prejudice (Colin Firth & Jennifer Ehle), and 2008 Sense and Sensibility (Hattie Moran & Charity Wakefield) as a well written, well-directed, delightful movie. Ayna Taylor-Joy as Emma is not only convincing but absolutely irritating, in a good way, in her smug arrogance of what she believes superior thinking and judgment. Taylor-Joy brings out the claws of jealousy very well. Emma's humbling is more believable as other adaptations simply made Emma appear to regret that she didn't get what she wanted, not a real reformation. Superb performance.
Everyone in the cast did an excellent job and truly brought their characters to life. Even though some artistic license has been taken, it doesn't deviate from the overall story written by Ms. Austen.
I highly recommend this movie and will watch it again and again!!"
121,"The cinematography that you see in the trailers is abundant in the film. Beautiful set, costumes, camera work and direction. It is also such a relief to see that the costumes and hair styles have been researched. Hopefully other period dramas will learn from this that staying true to the way people actually looked during this era is not a sacrifice on the beauty of the costume. After many years of just seeing pieces of hair fall at the front of an updo, we also get to see ringlets of the regency era!Onto the plot, the plot is pretty much as Jane Austen would have wanted it. It carries her constant theme of mocking regency society with all it's peculiar unwritten rules. The language also has a similar intelligence and wit shown in the books. However I do feel that for the casual viewer who isn't interested in classic literature or reading up on History, I think they may find this adaptation a little cold. I've heard some people say they expected it to be funnier, I would say it is more accurate to say it is full of wit rather than laugh out loud funny. I also know many people are used to masses of passion in period drama romance the so called 'bodice ripping' passion, this is not that kind of film. This drama carries the subtle romance and friendship of l classic literature and I have to say even as someone who can appreciate them staying true to the books, I did find the chemistry between the two leads a little bit lacking. That's just a nitpick though and overall I loved it. 9/10"
122,"Had never seen previous vision of Emma,but already amazed by its beautiful setup and screenplay for this new version. Everyone bring life and energy into the character. A little bit confuse with the family 🌲 relationship,have to go google it. But once u understand it, it's fun and interesting to watch. Will watch the previous version once had the time."
123,"Gwyneth Paltrow was the absolute worst at this role, like many she has undertaken. Finally we have an Emma we can be proud of. A beautifully shot film, and acting superb executed. Ill watch it again and again."
124,"At first i was not convinced, i found the main caracter to be - hard to like, but as movie progressed it drew me in and i ended up loving it.If you are a fan of this period of time, this movie is worth watching."
125,"I agree entirely with a lot of the other other reviews for this movie. The decor and costume in this movie was sublime. Besides that, I blame the director entirely for how this movie turned out. Music was way off and sometimes louder then the actors and I couldn't make out what they were saying. The movie is about Emma and they tried to mix it up a bit with storyline & humor, but it fell flat. Spending to much time on character development and they lost me on the original story line.
When Gwenyth Paltrow played this part, she had a tad sense of snobbery to her character but this actress was pushing it to the limits and I ended up not liking her. She learns from her ways as the movie progresses but I simply didn't care for it. Character chemistry was bad as well. I couldn't even tell when exactly Mr. Knightly fell for her, besides after the dance. Mr. Elton's character I interpret to be ridiculous naturally but this guys was off the charts. In a nut shell, I am going home to rewatch the original. Save your money! P.S. I did love Emma's father. So I give it 1 star for decor/costume and 1 star for Emma's father."
126,"Romantic period drama, adapted from the classic novel by Jane AustenI saw this recently on a rainy afternoon on Isle of Wight.
It looks like Bill Nighy had loads of fun making this with many comedy moments. Great costume design, the acts are separated by the four seasons. All about match making, everyone ends up with who they should be with! Recommended."
127,"This film is not funny, but at least it is a unique take on the story, though it feels lifeless and flat. The costumes are beautiful, and the acting is good."
128,"Well,I liked this version , not perfect but very watchable. I was not familiar with Anya Taylor-Joy and at first was distracted by her , to me, un-Emma ish looks . I got over that though and found her rather good . Johnny Flynn's Mr Knightly was, I thought , not anywhere near dignified and dictatorial enough and not really old enough either, but he is so watchable and fun that I got over that too.
Bill Nighy as Mr Woodhouse was very interesting casting - he played him as endearing , even loveable, and eccentric rather the selfish hypochondriacal old misery the book portrayed . But I love Bill Nighy and he can do no wrong as far as I am concerned. Miranda Hart as Miss Bates , also interesting. Too young and not really boring enough but a delight anyway.I do not understand another reviewer not being able to tell some characters apart - Mrs and Mrs Elton for eg, are sui generis and played excellently. Harriet Smith too . I did agree that it was odd that Emma's sister Isabella and her husband the younger Mr Knightly are portrayed as having a seriously acrimonious marriage , not at all what I remember from the novel , where she was certainly neurotic about colds and stuff but Mr John Knightly was kind of amused and tolerant.So , all in all, I liked it and found it not at all parodic or without substance.
Oh and costume and location just sumptuous . Actually I don't remember the Woodhouse residence as being THAT sumptuous , but eh..."
129,"I am not a massive fan of period dramas but I will give any film a try and write often like them, however I just found this film as dull as dishwater.To be honest the story proves that not everything great writers write is great. It's a pretty obvious film with not a great plot and very little drama.The acting and the scenery are ok but the pace is painfully slow."
130,Not as if it was a bad movie. It is just not a good one. Austen spirit is totally lost on this. Characters are acting instead of living and are inconsistent in their manner. Actors behave like stuffed dolls because of this and sometimes look like they don't want to play like that. Over-sensuality of some relationships is also distracting and unnecessary. The beauty of costumes and location is though undeniable. Good actors are waste in a beautiful but totally meaningless movie.
131,"Over the years, I've seen several film adaptations of Emma, my second favourite Austen novel (after Persuasion). Every version brings out different, and revealing, aspects of the story. This new adaptation achieved the same effect. The sets, colour and costumes were all superb. One achievement of this version was to bring the comedy in the story to the fore. For instance, it firmly placed Mr Elton alongside Mr Collins as one of Austen's ""silly vicars"". One or two casting choices did not quite gel with my preconceptions, but even there, it was interesting to see those characters presented in a different light. There were also parts of the story that I'd never seen highlighted before, such as the platoon of girls from Harriet's school, Mr Martin's sisters, the formality of everyday life in the Woodhouse mansion. Ultimately, the film tells the story in satisfactory fashion. I was able to tick off each scene, the appearance of the main characters, and even famous lines, in correct sequence. and without undue distortion."
132,"I've never seen an Emma adaptation before and thoroughly enjoyed this one. Anya TAYLOR-JOY and Mia Goth were outstanding. Yes it's the same old Jane Austin stuff but imo it is period drama done right, unlike what I thought was a hideous version of Little Woman that was over hyped before Xmas. A little slow in places if you have to be critical but stick with it and I doubt it will dissapoint many but the most miserable movie goer."
133,"EmmaI am torn between liking the movie for what it is or reviewing this with regard to its authenticity with the novel or indeed by comparison to other visual interpretations over the years.Either way there were some distinct problems with this production and indeed some total joys.What was goodWe had some brilliant cameos that upped this movie and were quite memorable, Miranda Hart for one.The styling was spot on in terms of the clothes, hair, makeup and interiors.What was deeply problematicWhat separates Jane Austen from Barbara Cartland, obvious, her brilliant use of language to poke fun at a society of manners and the rigid conventions of her time and thereby reveal some insights into the human condition. This production was unfortunately Barbara Cartland, Georgian ""speak"" was largely absent in the first 45 minutes, the script was heavy and there was just no lightness of touch in recreating the interchange between Knightly and Emma. I would suggest everyone can understand Georgian speak as with Shakespearean speak and if they can't they best man up or leave the theatre, we cannot dumb down the language of these great authors without it ceasing to be their work.Emma is a flawed heroine, Jane Austen said ""no one could like her except herself"", but we must love her despite her shortcomings, she is well meaning, but her reading of the world and her errors in judgement come from inexperience, the gap between these realities is revealed by Knightly and it is this that defines the manners and conventions of the day, whether just or not. In this movie she just appeared an interfering busybody and we didn't like her, her motivations were merely suggested to be vanity, not true!Mr Woodhouse was really presented as a caricature but in the novel he was less comedic and more irritating pedant, in many ways, as F.R.Leavis argues, it is his influence and indulgence that has created the monstrous errors in judgement that Emma makes.We just were not rooted in the Georgian period, the score was wrong, the script was wrong, everything was too clean even on the farm. The set pieces, the balls, the picnic was all clumsily handled, such a shame. I did enjoy the piano recital scene that was good.We have had in recent months Liitle Women, David Copperfield and now Emma, of the three Little Women was the best. But overall all three are an unmitigated disaster as they failed to capture the essence of the great novels from which they derived, in all it is not just the story that needs to be conveyed but the larger insights into humanity and the interactions between us all. If you want a new story then write one, never butcher a great masterpiece for either accessibility or political reasons. No more please!"
134,"There is no getting around the fact that Emma is a wonderfully made film, and one of the best of the year in terms of the production design. Every shot was captured in such a way that made us feel embezzled in that time period, and this was all down to the direction by Autumn de Wilde.In my opinion, we also got the best performance of the year so far with Anya Taylor-Joy playing the lead. She has been one of my favourite up-and-coming actresses for a few years now, and this just cemented it. She was absolutely phenomenal in the role, and kept me locked in the whole time.Going into Emma, I knew that it wouldn't be a film that I loved. Period pieces are my least favourite genre because I don't find them to be all that interesting, so I am not surprised that I didn't flat-out love this film. The fact that I came away saying that I liked it counts as a win in my book.The camera-work, the cinematography, and the visuals were all astounding, and most of the supporting cast did an excellent job. Bill Nighy is great in everything, and I was also impressed with Johnny Flynn. For me, the one weak element with the cast was Miranda Hart. I find her to be a terrible actress in everything I have seen her in, which is a shame. I rarely say that an actor is bad, but she was a real detractor from the film.Overall, Emma was brilliant from a film-making point-of-view, and there were a couple of story elements which I really did enjoy, but I can't get my score any higher because it's just not the type of film which I find myself loving.SCORE: 73%"
135,"This long form Music Video with dialogue was inspired by Austen but did not serve the classic author's story or intent.
Emma should be likeable/vulnerable. Anya's protrayal was not. The emotional arc and distance written in the novel for this beloved title character was not covered.
Because the portrayal was so negatively overdone, supporting characters had no chance for nuance resorting then to broad inhuman characterizations.
Gorgeous but overproduced historically inaccurate aesthetics.
Despite the heavy handed direction, outstanding performances were created by Bill Nighy and Johnny Flynn."
136,"I must admit this was not a film I thought I would be seeing this week but a family member managed to convince me to see Emma so this is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a young woman attempt to meddle with other peoples love life while craving to be an independant woman.
Main Character
Anya Taylor-Joy is a really great actress probably known for her great performance in Split and her role in the sequel Glass. She does fit the role of Emma very well for sure, she has the look of a period drama actress and she has the acting ability to pull off the lead in this role. But the problem was with the character of Emma herself, she is just rather unlikeable, yes I understand that this was the point of the film but never in this film did I care about her, root for her or feel sympathy for her even though the film really wants you too.
Supporting Characters
Johnny Flynn plays the main supporting role in the film and he is very good in this film, one aspect of the film I did like was his chemistry with Joy and how the two characters clashed a lot and he basically calls her out for her flaws as he is the only character that does this in the film. Billy Nighy has a role in the film and he is basically the comic relief in the film with very little character, still he was entertaining in his role and it is nice to see him in this role as I haven't seen Nighy in much recently. There are plenty of other characters in this film, probably a few too many but none of them are particularly interesting I just didn't care about any of them ore there plights because for the most part Emma didn't seem to care and that's who we see the film through.
Story
This film is based on the book written by Jane Austen, so I expected at least an interesting narrative in the film and some depth to the characters but I just didn't find it in this film, nothing really happens in this film. The plot moves at a snails place and just focuses on the romance storylines but doesn't look past that and try and make the story more interesting. Plus I know it is based on material but this film is really predictable, the film ended exactly as I expected and there was nothing to suprise or interest me here.
Script
The script has some funny moments and dialogue which does work but it is not good enough to carry this film as a comedy but the film doesn't have good enough dramatic dialogue to make this anywhere close to a drama. This means there was some okay moments but not enough to flesh out the characters or make them funny.
Style
Now this is a period drama, so this film looks great. All the costumes and designs are top notch, a big compliment to the people who worked on this aspect of the film because it felt very authentic. However, this films tone is never properly defined, apparently it is meant to be a comedy but it isn't that funny so it fails there. Also the pacing of the film, the film is 2 hours long but I swear feels like double that, I was so bored I cannot explain.
Overall
Overall, if you like period dramas you might like this film but to me it is just a boring film that is just not worth a watch."
137,"If someone hasn't seen the movie from 1996, than he/she would say it's excellent(of course if you are into these kinds of movies).But even if you're watching it for the first time - if you have a poor movie specter - you would say it 's excellent.Mine's quite wide , so I really must say that this movie adaption is very bad.Very wrong choice of actors, especially the lead ones, no chemistry between them, no soul in this whole story-line. Comparing to the 1996 version, this one is a total fail.Not worth seeing it.I mean you can, If you want to make comparison with the other version or the book of course and then to be disappointed. What I don't understand is how people leave 8 or 9 stars to this :O , there must be something wrong with them :P"
138,"First time ever seeing Emma. Haven't read the classic novel neither and truly went in blind.
I loved every minute, so tasteful and beautifully done.
It's made me a big Jane Austen fan and couldn't wait to tell everyone about it."
139,"I love the book, i love the previous adaptations of Emma, but this version greatly fell short. I was excited to see such a cast.... Bill Nighy is greatly under used. Johnny Flynn was good, but lacked chemistry with the Anya Taylor-Joy - who played an unconvincing and less than delightful Emma. Apart from stunning visuals, this adaption lacked heart."
140,"So I've never written a review before, but I recently read the book of Emma and thought I would give this film a try. Honestly, it's really bad. It looks beautiful, but the weird nudity parts do not fit into the atmosphere of the film (and Austen books/films in general) at all. The actors completely miss the defining characteristics of the characters and seem to be making a parody of the book. About twenty minutes in I considered doing something better with my time but instead persevered in the hope of seeing a change for the better. There wasn't one."
141,Gave it a three just got the period attire and scenery. But watching paint dry has more comedic responses than the entire dialog.
142,"I felt like the film struggled to find its footing for the first 10-15 minutes. But it does pick up. I dont know if I can explain it well but it felt like the film was trying to hard to appeal to a modern audience. Not with costumes or dialogue...but the kind of way the comedy was presented. Like, I just dont think we really needed a scene where Emma lifts up her skirt to warm her bare bum by the fire. But as I said, I thought the film picked up early into the film and I was able to get into it without much issue. I very much enjoyed the scene where Knightley and Emma do realize their feelings for one another and he runs back to her house. Although the actual proposal scene...again had a unnecessary element (in my opinion) where she has a nosebleed. Again, felt like a random throw in for a laugh. I also didnt like the actor playing Elton. I don't know if it was his choice or a director's choice but he just came off very weird. I know his character is supposed to be kind of like that, but his acting seemed to be comprised of weirdly smiling at the camera. I dont know it was very off-putting. I thought everyone else was very good though. Anya-Taylor Joy is very good as the title character Emma, but I overall liked Mia Goth's Harriet more. I think there was a tad more of a ""natural"" presence to her. I thought Johnny Flynn was good as Knightley although a tad distracting how short he was in comparison to other male leads.Overall, I did really like the film. I thought it was very cute, charming and funny. And the costumes are stunning. Well in particular what Emma gets to wear. And the production design is very nice as well. I love how bright and cheery everything looks."
143,"And this movie adaptation captures the exquisite irony and humour of the novel. It's light, fluffy, and deadly serious."
144,"The cast are perfection, the settings sublime and the social observation is as 'Austen' as any Austen I've seen. Yes, this new version of ""Emma"" is really quite wonderful and I would venture to say even a step up on the 1996 Douglas McGrath version. My only real quibble is that Anya Taylor-Joy, fine as she is, can't quite match Gwyneth Paltrow. Otherwise, what's not to love; a Knightly who isn't too suave or too handsome, (Johnny Flynn, splendid), a Frank Churchill who actually is something of a charmer and nowhere near as obnoxioous as he's often painted, (an excellent Callum Turner), and a gorgeously obsequious Mr. Elton from Josh O'Connor who just about walks off with the film while director Autumn de Wilde, (love that name), keeps it very nicely in period , (none of those little post-modern nods that now seem to be common in pictures of this kind). I also loved her use of English folk song on the soundtrack but this was just the icing on a very sweet cake. This is Jane Austen the way Jane Austen should be done."
145,Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart must be having a sit down with their agents getting them mixed up in this production. It really is tedious. I have nothing good to say and don't want to review the bad so I will stop here. If you want to see it be sure you see it for free.
146,Imagine a fake rubbish version of Downton Abbey. Really really bad production. Characters have no credibility and even a foreigner like myself can imitate better posh English and pronunciation that the actors. Emma is utter rubbish at putting an aristocrat accent. How dull and terrible
147,"This hyper-stylized flick is a replay of the same story that has been produced, reproduced and RE-re-produced over the past 25 years. Austen had her moment...I'm sure among some, she still does (though Sanditon on PBS now is also uninteresting) but she needs to be given a rest now. This is another attempt at repackaging something that has ebbed out and needs to be given a rest for the next while.The acting, set design....all of it is all good and well but yawn!"
148,"Most BORING movie i have ever seen,spent the whole time during the movie trying to stay awake."
149,"Emma starts of promisingly, infact the first 30 minutes of the film is very interesting and looked award worthy for its production design, costumes and cinematography. The real problem with Emma is that the plot doesn't necessarily have any strong characters except for the central one. The movie teases multiple conflicts between the characters and fails to focus seriously on a single one.Most of the plot points are so forgettable and in the middle of the film you would be wondering what's the point of this movie. Anya Taylor Joy shines as Emma Woodhouse and Mia Goth is neat. Bill Nighy appears on the screen every now and then but his character is completely wasted.Watch it if you are a huge aficionado of Jane Austen if not skip it."
150,"The writer's slapstick sense of humour felt like something I'd expect a ten year old to come up with. It fell so flat, some scenes were painful to watch. The wise and gentlemanly Mr Knightley behaving like a fool is somehow funny? This was a complete insult to the book, did not get what they were trying to achieve one bit."
151,Bad bad bad .emma 2009 was a masterpiece but this..this is a mess .for god sake what is this !!
152,"Jane Austen's well loved heroines including Elizabeth Bennett, Fanny Price and Ann Elliot are mainly gentlewomen, without large dowries, and therefore in need of a good marriage. Anya Taylor-Joy relishes the period role of the tightly curled Emma Woodhouse, being neither in need of a dowry nor a husband, preferring instead to matchmake her friends. But unhappily happy with her success as she watches her own governess Miss Taylor marry Mr Weston, a nearby wealthy widower. With Rupert Graves and Gemma Whelan the happy couple.Autumn de Wilde directs Emma. with Bill Nighy as her father, hilariously suffering from chills, and keeping his men busy around the house moving screens to continuously keep them from him. They were an unscripted hoot, and the film highlighted the idleness of the wealthy of the time.In dire need of a project Emma embarks upon finding her giddy new friend a suitable husband. Mia Goth is terrific as the red cloaked naive schoolgirl Harriet Smith. And Emma sees local vicar Mr Elton as the perfect candidate. With toady Josh O'Connor, Jane Austen definitely had a thing against vicars, writing such odious characters, but sadly in 1815 they were considered a catch.Emma's neighbour and conscience Mr Knightly is the lovely Johnny Flynn, although sadly a little lacking in height when lined up to dance. But he's rich and single. And having known Emma since childhood is not afraid to tell her off when she needs it. I enjoyed seeing more of Mr Knightley's home life rather than him just arriving and leaving. And loved how Autumn de Wilde updated her Emma to include Christmas visitors Mr Knightley's brother and Emma's sister as a married couple struggling as new parents. We haven't seen such domestic strops before. I have to say I think Oliver Chris's John was getting the rougher end of his marriage to Chloe Pirrie's Isabella. Mr Knightley has been warned.A subsequent Christmas dinner at the Weston's home was a real farce, being rudely interrupted by the threat of snow and a comedic dash to the carriages by hypochondriac Mr Woodhouse and Isabella. Leaving the Westons spinning in their empty dining room and Emma facing a carriage ride home with the oily Mr Elton. It does not end well for Harriet!But this is Emma's story and Mr Knightley watches all her movements from the side lines. He has the measure of their friends and acquaintances even if Emma herself cannot see them. Chief amongst them is Frank Churchill. Callum Turner plays the scandalous cad who intrigues and catches Emma's eye. And while Knightley tries to dissuade her from falling for him, after all he didn't even have the courtesy to come to his father's marriage to Miss Taylor, Knightly implores, but Emma will take no notice. And Mr Elton, who Knightley knows will never marry Harriet with no fortune or name, but his tenant farmer Connor Swindells's Mr Martin would make an admirable husband. And they do seem to love each other, even if Harriet spurns him, when Emma turns her snobby nose up at the decent farmer. Obnoxious Mr Elton does of course end up with the perfectly awful and rich wife he deserves, played by the game Tanya Reynolds.The score by Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer was witty, with almost Gilbert & Sullivan like comedic tunes with the genteel Regency dancing mixes. I love the Regency period so Kate Quinn's production design was divine with sumptuous Georgian Palladian mansions and the local haberdashery store, a purveyor of fancy goods, a veritable Aladdin's cave. And the colourful sugar iced Regency costumes by talented Alexandra Byrne were beautiful.Into this gorgeous comedy of manners drops Jane Fairfax to set the cat amongst the pigeons. Emma has already had quite enough of her with Miss Bates excited descriptions of her niece. Miranda Hart added the comedy to the genteel unmarried Miss Bates fallen on hard times with her deaf mother. But Jane is her source of satisfaction and comfort. And would Miss Woodhouse like to hear what is happening in Jane's most recent letter?Well Jane is here now and Miss Bates is eager for them to meet, and maybe be great friends. Jane is poor, pretty and accomplished, whereas Emma is rich and pretty so has no need to be truly accomplished. But she is jealous. Especially when Mr Knightley pays attention to Jane, duets with her, and lends her his carriage afterwards. To be honest I thought Amber Anderson's Jane was an insipid character, Polly Walker played her with more spark, but she may have been scripted that way by Eleanor Catton. The script overall was sparkling with zingers and Frank Churchill adding catty comments for Emma's amusement. All coming to a head at a picnic where everyone is having a good time, until Emma insults Miss Bates, to everyone's discomfort. Gwyneth Paltrow did it way better. There was so much cruelty in her dripping words, Anya was far too sweet. But Mr Knightley is quick to chastise her.And realising her callousness Emma does try to grow, eating humble pie and making amends with those she has wronged. And even accepting that Mr Knightley may love someone. Who isn't her. Just as she realises that all their sweet nothings were actually something after all.Well done to Autumn de Wilde for her first directing gig and a very entertaining cast and crew."
153,"This is far too long and On the whole the film struggles to find its footing. The plot was not convincing or strong enough and I couldn't get to grips with what was really going on for the first half hour. You have to listen carefully to what they're trying to say most the time I had no idea... maybe a better screen adaptation to ""today's audience"" would've been better.
The costumes emma wore were absolutely divine though and saved some of this film. I loved the actress who played Harriet she is stunning"
154,"I really enjoyed this film, i am a huge Austen fan with Emma being a particular favourite. The actors amd outfits were great, the whit throughout was very comical and enjoyable and mostly it stayed true to the novel. The reasons i have marked it down are some of the added scenes and changes to the original story. I disliked the knightly Emma scene when he comes clean and she has a nose bleed and i also felt the Jane and Mr Churchill story wasnt as clear and maybe confusing for someone without prior Emma knowledge. Overall though another good adaptation of a great book."
155,"Emma is one of those films with such a strong cast and oozing with beauty in every shot but at the same time lacks heart and depth.Anya Taylor-Joy who is one of my favourite actresses working at the moment is amazing here and shows she can do a lot more than just horror. Everyone is terrifc here but the other highlights are Bill Nighy, Mia Goth and Johnny FlynnWhilst there is nothing to fault in terms of production design and costumes, there are flaws within the film. The main flaw being that it feels quite familiar in terms of story despite having some strong writing. It also feels tonally unbalanced at times with some really silly moments which don't exactly work The pacing does drag even for a period piece and that's probably the biggest flaw. That being said the film is beautifully shot and has some terrific cinematography.Overall it may have it's faults and it will probably be forgotten about by the end of the year, but it's definitely one worth watching"
156,Visually stunning. Misplaced histrionics replace subtlety and subtext to the point where it is no longer Jane Austen. A talented director could have saved this beautiful production but most scenes never scratch the surface of what should be going on.
157,"In the 1929 Soviet propaganda film THE NEW BABYLON the Paris bourgeoisie are watching from a hill as the Paris commune is being brutally crushed. The film effectively contrasts the idle rich feasting above with the workers being slaughtered below. In Autumn de Wilde's EMMA we find a not dissimilar scene with the genteel society of the town lounging lazily on a hill to enjoy the view. This time the contrast needs no cross-cutting as the film makes sure we see enough of the servants whose unrecognized work makes this idleness possible. Throughout EMMA we find these sly little vignettes of servants carrying out menial tasks: dressing or undressing the named characters, serving food or placing screens for Emma's eccentric father. The film makes it quite clear that a society as preposterous as regency England's has these two sides to it: the hard-working real people and the hothouse flowers like Emma Woodhouse (who - by the way - we first encounter in her own hothouse picking flowers). And while those at the top of the social ladder in this film talk incessantly, those at the lower end never get to speak, neither the servants nor the salt-of-the-earth farmer Mr Martin. An exception seems to be Mr Knightley's servant, who reprimands him for walking rather than using his carriage. And here we have it: Mr Knightley is different, more real than the rest of the gentility. He goes out riding with Mr Martin the farmer and we are told he cares more for his tenant farmers than his grand house, where normally all the stately rooms are closed up. And it is Mr Knightley, in the scene on the hill, who reminds Emma Woodhouse of her privileged position.
Unlike in Greta Gerwig's LITTLE WOMEN, however, here the wokeness and subtle political messages add to rather than distract from telling the story. De Wilde has simply identified these messages in the novel and put them on display in her direction. That means that the film can still revel and luxuriate it decors, costumes and jewelry, these elements simply take on a different meaning.
Add to that the fact that the acting, direction and camerawork are wonderful throughout, the writing is razor-sharp and the whole thing is wonderfully tongue-in-cheek, and you have an extremely enjoyable up-to-date adaptation of a much-beloved novel."
158,"If I had to describe the film in one word, that word would be dull!"
159,I'm not going to waffle on about the book or compare that with this film adaptation. I don't want to go into lengthy analysis of the main characters either. I admit I did not manage to watch it to the end as I had other things I could watch. All I can say is as a film it was not funny and rather boring.
160,"Emma Woodhouse; a wealthy gentlewoman involves herself in match-making with supreme self-confidence but little expertise.Great for couples and adults. The 1996 version stretches out the romantic agony a bit better but this is more humorous. Bill Nighy's subtle comic relief is great. Anya Taylor-Joy does really well as Emma and beautifully portrays her inner conflict as she realises her social shortcomings. When Emma tries out her clumsy wit at the picnic the cinema audience drew in a collective sharp breath. Watching the servants mutely obliging their masters was entertaining on its own.The costumes and scenery is very good. The story moves at pace.I liked, 'Was that a draft?'"
161,"Don't waste your time. Yawn. We are big fans of English period dramas, but actuality turned this one off halfway in. It is a major snore. You will be taking asleep. I wish I could demand a refund for the rental fee. The acting was terrible. The humor was rare. Don't waste your time. Yawn.

162,"I read a few reviews before heading to see the movies, so I prepared myself for a flawed shallow movie. I was pleasently surprised. This version of Emma kept me engaged throughout. I found it easy to empathise with this Emma, as misguided as she was. Even her words to Miss Bates made a lot of sense to me given how often we see her trapped by social curteousy to listen to her talk on and on about Jane. Her tears felt very real and raw after Mr Knightly scolding. I loved the costumes, interiors and cast. The scene where Mr Knightly and Emma feel attraction for each other the first time was expertly done. Even though I do not particulary like the casting choice for Mr Knightly, I could see the attraction between the two. Would happily rewatch."
163,"I resisted seeing seeing this movie at first. I have read Jane Austen's novel, and seen three other versions, including Amy Heckerling's funny updating, CLUELESS (1995). Did I need to see another film in which a rich, entitled young woman discovers she does not know how to rule herself, let alone the world?Alas, despite the sumptuous world in which dinner parties with pastry that looks like Wedgewood china abound, with every meal accompanied by impassive servants who are little more than automata to serve one's wishes, Anya Taylor-Joy is Emma. Although she claims her efforts to matchmake are altruistic, her cat-like gaze and syrupy words belie this. It's all self-aggrandizing conceit, and Johnny Flynn as the hectoring Mr. Knightley sees this unerringly.It's the auctorial contempt that sets the unfortunate tone of this entire movie. There is not one major character to admire or root for by the halfway mark, save Rupert Graves and Gemma Whelan. A lot of comedies start out with the lead needing a kick in the pants, and giving it to them. By the halfway mark, however, there should be someone root for. Here, no one seems to make any progress until near the end, when the author recalls that all novels should end with the young women either dead or married, and this is a comedy, for heaven's sake.Visually, the movie is beautiful, and the actors are marvelous. It would have been preferable to have screenwriters who were more sympathetic to Miss Austen's characters. They are not the first children of the wealthy to over-rate themselves, and they won't be the last."
164,"Can i just give the movie rate in minus?It was a terrible mistake going to watch such a boring - nostory- nocomedy noaction nodrama movie.
God, i need clorox to wash my eyes and acid to wash my brain.
Do yourself a favour and dont watch the movie at all, at least not in a cinema so you pay money for this s***"
165,"Not going to lie, genuinely had a dribble. Not in a good way (doubt there is a good version of dribbling) . The only highlight was eating my pepperoni pizza with extra cheese I snuck in my mates bag, halfway through the film. Had a little snooze (May have snored but the whole room was asleep so no harm done) and woke up to a 40 second scene of someone walking down a corridor. Woke up again at the end and had to cleanse my eyes from what I had witnessed (which to be fair wasn't a lot as only saw 40 mins worth then decided my sleep debt was more worthy of focus). Apart from that though, 10/10 in my opinion. Miranda saved me and the cinema room from leaving, let's be honest."
166,"Greetings again from the darkness. Choosing Jane Austen's beloved 1815 novel for one's feature film directorial debut is an ambitious decision, and one for which photographer Autumn de Wilde proves she is up to the challenge. Ms. de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton may have added a period to the title to distinguish this version from the 1996 film starring Gwyneth Paltrow, or perhaps it was a personal stamp proclaiming this to be the definitive version. Regardless, coming on the heels of Greta Gerwig's superb LITTLE WOMEN, both films blend a timeless literary classic with contemporary talent and attitude. Additionally, viewers may note some tonal similarities to this and the 2018 hit THE FAVOURITE (for which Oliva Colman won an Oscar).It's one of the finest crafted and most famous opening lines in the history of literature: ""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her."" The decision to cast mega-talented rising star Anya Taylor-Joy (THOROUGHBREDS, THE WITCH) as Emma provides a level of deliciously wicked entertainment that we can only hope Ms. Austen envisioned. Emma is spoiled and not really very likable, and though she sees herself as an all-knowing matchmaker, her family wealth and social status do little to override the quite common level of immaturity and faux-wisdom associated with her age.For those unfamiliar with the novel, you may experience a slow build-up to connection with the characters ... of which there are many who appear early on and with little introduction. Emma lives in her ""comfortable"" home Hartfield with her father (an offbeat and slyly comical Bill Nighy). Days are spent visiting and being visited by a community of folks who seem to have little to worry about in life other than who might marry whom. When young Harriet Smith (a terrific Mia Goth, A CURE FOR WELLNESS, 2017) comes to live with Emma, Harriet's naivety causes her to easily fall under Emma's matchmaking spell - resulting in some awkward moments and regretful decisions.Interesting characters are everywhere we turn. Mr. Elton (an energetic and riotous Josh O'Connor) is the local vicar who is both amusing (""Inn-O-cence"") and a bit difficult to read, as Emma misinterprets his intentions causing one of the more startling developments. Frank Churchill (a stout and smirking Callum Turner) is initially one of the community's more mysterious characters, and his looks and future holdings make him a desirable catch. Jane Fairfax (Amber Anderson) carries on a nuanced rivalry with Emma, and brings a new dynamic when she visits her chatty and ''try-so-hard"" aunt, Miss Bates (a marvelous turn from Miranda Hart). As viewers we find Miss Bates to be at least as entertaining as Emma herself. Later in the film, Mr. Elton takes a bride (Tanya Reynolds), and her character provides a welcome and unsettling spark at just the right time.Of course, it's Mr. Knightley (played by musician Johnny Flynn, BEAST, 2017) who provides the moral backbone of the story. He seems to be the only one (other than her father) who recognizes the shred of goodness buried within Emma. Mr. Flynn gives a soulful performance, and is responsible for the single most touching scene in the film - a simple gesture of asking for a dance. Beyond that, his verbal sparring with Emma is usually morality based, or at straddling the line between politeness and rudeness. Ms. Taylor-Joy and Mr. Flynn and Ms. Hart are stand-outs in a superb cast that delivers the goods in each and every scene.What makes the Austen novel, and the film, so captivating are the issues of romance, marriage, age, and social status woven into each moment - each dramatic turn laced with comedic undertones. Subtext abounds in every conversation and interaction, and words spoken do not always carry the same message as body language or a glance. To top things off, the film is beautiful to look at. The dreary lighting often associated with period pieces is non-existent, and the costumes and set design are extraordinary. The score from Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer is a perfect fit, and allows us to recall that for the 1996 EMMA, composer Rachel Portman won the Oscar ... the last female to win until this year when Hildur Guonadottir won for JOKER. It should also be noted that the 1995 film CLUELESS with Alicia Silverstone was a modern-day take on the Austen novel, and regardless of the format (or whether there is a period in the title), Emma continues to be ""handsome, clever, and rich."""
167,""" Carry on Emma"" it is a truth universally acknowledged that in producing a film of a beloved book which has been successfully filmed many times before You at least try to read and understand the book first. If this approach had been tried by Armando Iannucci he could have carried it off but these two appear to have constructed a "" natural child"" of the Jane Austen Novel. Mr Woodhouse is too lively, Mr Knightly too sexy, and certainly not 16 years older than Emma. I keep expecting Miss Bates to launch into a naughty turn to screen. So sad, my advice watch any other version from the last 20 years. What a waste of colourful costumes and setting. I wish to consciously uncouple from this version and return to Paltrow , Northam and Mc Gregor."
168,Movie looked nice and Emma did a nice job.. it just didn't seem as fun or interesting as I thought it might be. More traditional than I thought it would be... which isn't necessary a problem.. but ended up not being as fresh as I had hoped. Amazing costumes and looked wonderful. Still fun.. but more of a traditional telling of the Jane Austen story.
169,"It is nice to see both Emma. and Little Women adapted in a meaningful manner by directors who just seem to... get it.Emma. is one of the funniest Austen adaptations I have ever seen-humor being mostly missing from film and TV adaptations of her work. Despite the original novels being intended to satire Regency society, a lot of adaptations decide, oddly, to play their stories straight. The strength of Emma. isn't in how it diverges from the source material; it is what has been found within the pages of the novel. A sharp script and charming performances have allowed for this Austen adaptation to make me laugh out loud at points; an accomplishment for dialogue that is, mostly, a few hundred years old giving it a timeless and intelligent quality.The cast are superbly matched to their roles: whether it's Anya Taylor-Joy as the sharply intelligent and proud Emma, Johnny Flynn as the thoughtful and compassionate Mr Knightley, Bill Nighy as the ever complaining father or Miranda Hart as the chatty and sweet Miss Bates. Everyone is perfectly matched to their role.The film's ultimate strength is in the absolute gorgeousity dripping from its costuming and set design. With pastel palettes and perfect symmetry, with every frame feeling like a period-appropriate master painting. This, mixed with strong performances and a charming screenplay , wonderful soundtrack allows for a film that is a delight to watch. I am finding it difficult to lend more words to my absolute enjoyment of the film. 9/10"
170,Bill Nighy was perfection. I dismissed the music score before leaving the theatre. Emma is at once frustratingly aristocratic and also naive. This adaptation captures so well Austen's ability to parody class differences primarily in attitudes in a way that isa both moving and hilarious. I enjoyed every moment as I trust you will also!
171,"Emma
2020
Director: Autumn de wilde
Starring: Anya Taylor Joy, Bill Nighy, Miranda Hart, Tanya Reynolds, Conner Swindell's, Johnny Flynn, Mia Goth, Josh o Connor, Callum Turner etcOverall rating 86/100Emma is based in the 1800's and it follows a very wealthy and stress-free young lady called Emma. Her heart is in the right place but her selfish actions when it comes to finding love for herself and other people have repercussions and she must fight to fix them. Emma was a delightfully charming movie. With excellent performances, humour and very good character development throughout, lets talk about this more in detail.First of all, the film had fantastic cinematography and set pieces, whilst also having a very charming/romantic tone. The films cinematography reminded me a lot of little women's, with its wonderfully natural, simplistic but strikingly beautiful scenery that really was fantastic to look at and get lost in. And the set pieces and costumes were fantastic as well, definitely transporting you to the period of the time, so they did a fantastic job at transporting you to a completely different era in time. The film also had a delightfully charming and romantic tone. The whole film had a warmth to it that never went away throughout. And the film was very romantic which left for many heart-warming moments as you couldn't help but cheer for the characters who all ended up with the right people.Next the film had great themes and messages and was actually fairly funny. The film tackled some big issues still involved within todays society and they were all handled very well. What I got from it was that there is still a social class divide and stereotypes for both that people expect. As well as being careful with not getting to involved with people's personal lives. The film was also fairly funny as well. The film thrived off really awkward situations really well breaking the tension with some very funny one liners and use of props. Key standouts for me were Bill Nighy, Miranda Hart and Tanya Reynolds.However, my only two negatives that bought this film down slightly for me was its occasional slow pacing and its choppy editing. The film was very slow paced and was largely dialogue, which for me wasn't an issue but I can see why it would be a turn off for some other people, but I think Emma knows its target audience. But my biggest issue for me was the choppy editing. The film had really quick cuts, so never really allowed a lot of scenes to resignate with the audience in the first half. This for me was really off putting and made the pacing clunky and made some scenes less impactful.My Next two positives would be the fantastic performance from Anya- Taylor joy and some other key acting standouts. Anya fitted perfectly with the role, she portrayed multiple personalities with her character perfectly, and you always believed that she had good intentions she just was unintentionally selfish. I also thought she had good chemistry with a lot of the other characters within the film as well. The other key standouts for me was Johnny Flynn who portrayed the emotional conflict of his character very well making you understand him and therefore making him likeable to watch. I have previously mentioned key comedic standouts of Bill Nighy, Tanya Reynolds and Miranda Hart who actually surprised me with a couple of more serious scenes as well. But the key standout for me was Mia Goth. She was fantastic here. She had fantastic on screen chemistry with whoever she was with. Her character was extremely likeable and her development throughout of still having Emma to support her but her character slowly learned to make her own decisions and stand on her own two feet and Mia portrayed this character perfectly.My final two positives would be the excellent character development and ending. Wow this film developed its characters excellently. The character of Emma started out as a very up herself and selfish person but with good intentions. And as the film progressed she slowly realised through her actions that she needed to change and this made her character more and more likeable so yes they could of split there time with more of the characters but the development for her character was so good I didn't really care. And finally the ending was incredibly satisfying, they did everything right, Emma apologised to the correct people and everyone ended up with the right people leading to a once again satisfying and heart-warming ending.Overall despite some editing issues which effected the impact of the first half. Emma is a brilliantly acted, charming, well crafted and funny movie that left me feeling satisfied with the end result."
172,"Just been to see Emma with my son and daughter and what a delight it was!
Perfectly cast!! Anya is a wonderful Emma, and I think they scoured England for the handsomest man they could find in Johnny Flynn as Mr Knightly
Bill Nighey and Miranda Hart added great character acting and humour.
Beautiful set in some stunning country homes The music really added to the polish of the movie it was like a character of its own
Emma followed the book faithfully and was perfectly paced, and the humour was played to the max it was so fun to watch. Spoiler: Mr Woodhouse and his 3 screens was a laugh out loud moment and there were many others!
Give yourself a treat and see this movie!!!!
I plan to go again"
173,"I love this version. It is my favorite screen version in fact (and I have really enjoyed all of them, including Clueless).I think a lot of people seemed to have missed the most important difference of this version, though the reviewer here did mention the realism and visceral nature.What I see as the most important change is Instead of the usual hiding and glossing over of the mechanics underpinning the romanticized world and era, inhabited by the charming main characters, where some kind of invisible magic allows these people to spend their lives in idle gossip and melodrama... de Wilde and Catton choose to ironically place the upstairs/downstairs nature of daily life right in every gorgeous and cluttered scene. The servants hustling to make all this happen, you see their faces, the expression of the effort, the privilege of the people who take them for granted, the class disparity, in the backdrop of the most gorgeous world of all the versions I've watched. But it's not meant to make the main characters look unsympathetic or cruel; it's just beyond their radar. And given Emma's entire plotting is informed by class and her perception of class, it's a very welcome layer of complexity.I think a lot of the extreme negativity (in IMDb reviews user reviews) towards this movie, and comments about the main characters in this version being charmless, comes from viewers being subliminally put off by the oblivious interactions of the main characters with their omnipresent servants, which also colors perception of Emma's actual dialog about class. Interestingly the many reviewers seem to find Bill Nighy casually treating the omnipresent servants like they are Alexa the automated house, and give him a pass. Reviewers judge women more harshly.Most productions of Emma discreetly put the servants off the screen via closeups on the main characters, and cut off their heads, or make them leave the room etc., so you just perceive the movie and scenes to have not actually contained all these other people.This version of Emma doesn't judge Emma and her fellow privileged class... it allows you to appreciate the narrative strictly from their point of view, and she is charming and empathetic and naive and well intentioned in that light. But the second narrative they ironically stares us in the face the whole time, is the spoiled, privileged, life melodrama and life of leisure they are all living, as the servants, in frame, scramble to make it all possible.I think it's more realistic, and a much needed realism, that is usually deliberately glossed over. It is usually glider over in order to be able to continue to romanticize the era and enjoy the whimsical fantasy nature of these period stories. This version of Emma is kind of a post-Downton Abbey (which while trying to more realistically portray upstairs downstairs and the critiques of this privileged aristocracy, still took an overly romantic view of the landed), Parasite era awareness (complex problems of class through a modern eye), take on Emma.It's enjoyable still on a straight story level, acting is top notch, and definitely my favorite screen version of Emma."
174,"Aaand here we have another misinterpretation of Jane Austen's Emma.Adaptations like these are off-putting. Yes, I must admit it took Sandy Welch to reveal her to me too, but after having had my eyes opened in 2008, then returning to the book - it is all there.I love my Emma, she is very dear to me. I take objection to her being portrayed as arrogant and snotty and superficial and haughty. Those are NOT her faults. This film, like all the others, makes her all vain, not just a little.And my dear beloved George's dry humour - where was it? Nowhere, that's where! They butchered the 'Mrs Knightley""-scene!Emma's infatuation with Frank Churchill was not made clear at all.Why make Isabella a b***h?What's with the red-coated girl parade? What is this? 'Don't look now'??No, no, no! The ball is not where they fall in love. To have something that's a slow developing realisation on both parts thrown in our faces so obviously is an insult.Emma's relationship with Harriet is wrong.The film is long and boring. The filmmaker made it laughable, but not in an endearing way. This film has no heart.And through all the colours and unnecessary opulence, at the end they turn the sweetest love scene into slapstick, after turning George into a wuss.And now, after having watched it for completeness's sake, I may forget about it.It needn't have been made on my account, and it does disservice to my dear Emma. This one I cannot love.Two good things about it, therefore two stars: George wasn't completely off at times, I liked that they put in the scene with George and Mrs Weston and George with Mr Martin. Bill Nighy was fun. Everything else is forgettable."
175,"I felt quite tired at the start of this film; it enters with a lot of sweeping movement, fast talking, and grand sets and costumes which offer far more detail than can be taken in. It had been a long day for me, but it did feel like it was a film trying to do too much. I was wrong in this first impression, but the approach of movement and pace did continue, and it gave the film a feel of being superficial and relying on pace and energy. To be fair, it makes this approach work and it is moves and looks delightful. It offers lots of nice touches that make it more than this, but it is ultimately not anything shockingly different from what you'd expect (which it probably shouldn't be anyway).The delivery of Emma as having more of a sharp edge is a nice touch, as it lets the viewer see what is charming about her, but also that she is not aware of the negative aspects of her own character, and thus does not control them. This adds a lot to the narrative that others do not, and Taylor-Joy does very well with the role. She is supported well, although mostly by those doing one or two things really well (eg Nighy and Hart). The design of the film is wonderful - great costumes, and locations throughout. In the end it does have a fast and breezy tone that I did take a minute to get into, but in the end it was cheering and quite lightly delightful as a film."
176,"Emma is a subtle comedy, delving into issues of marriage, sex, age, and social status. It was the last book of hers published while author Jane Austen was still alive. About the character Emma she said, preparing to write the novel, ""I am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like.""Emma is 21 and privileged, she fashions herself as a matchmaker and most of the stories that develop result from this. It truly is a comedy of manners. Not slapstick comedy, the type of subtle British comedy.This movie pretty well follows the novel and Anya Taylor-Joy to me is just perfect as Emma Woodhouse. She is a good actress but I especially love to look at her face, with her wide-set eyes and perfect lips. Strangely after she was selected to play the role she was hesitant, she said she didn't think of herself as attractive enough. In fact in an interview she said, ""I have never and I don't think I will ever think of myself as beautiful. I don't think I'm beautiful enough to be in films.""Bill Nighy is very good as her wealthy father Mr. Woodhouse and as often happens when he has a supporting role, Nighy steals every scene he is in.Good movie of a familiar story, I enjoyed it. I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library, my wife skipped."
177,"Emma is 21 we're told as this begins, with ""little in her life to vex her"". Lucky Emma I think. Emma (Anya Taylor-Joy) is a posh pain in the arse. It's a comedy, apparently, but I'm left waiting some time before even the slightest of smirks. It looks great though, in the way that most period dramas do. Sweeping vistas with vast country estates, furnished in meticulous grandeur. Thank god for Bill Nighy as Mr Woodhouse, Emma's father, at least he's mildly amusing in his general disinterest of everything. Based on a Jane Austin novel, none of this is a surprise. If you're after something unexpected, look elsewhere. This isn't bad though. Emma's only concern is social standing, meddling and manipulating those around her, like the perpetually unsure Miss Smith (Mia Goth) much to the annoyance of Mr Knightly (Johnny Flynn). It's a large cast, almost unruly and does feel bloated, but at the core, the main characters do work and the casting is pretty fantastic, Miranda Hart particularly is fun as the easily distracted Miss Bates. When I say Emma likes to meddle, that is true. However she meddles with purpose and for all the flowery nature of her world, she's by far the most real being in it. To put it plainly, Emma takes no s**t. Not from the disapproving Mr Knightly or the infatuated Mr Elton. I wouldn't take it from Mr Elton either, he's a bloody idiot. Emma herself doesn't bother with, well with anything. She's happy where she is, for now at least. She harbours a secret desire to be a future Mrs Churchill, to wed the mysterious Frank Churchill, whom we don't meet until the second half of the film. She's got competition though, from Jane Fairfax. Of course this is all misjudged, Emma not being as good a judge a character as she thought. Churchill is meddler himself, or a player, either way he's no good. Arrogant and self centred. It all has an air of silliness. Mr Elton surprises all, by marrying, brilliantly played by Tanya Reynolds from the hysterical TV show 'Sex Education'. Connor Swindells from the same show also features, although both are sadly underused. Confused? I'm sure you're not, but if you are, is just because I'm blurting our a load of character names, really it's all very trivial and predicable. Mr Knightly turning out to be the best catch. Emma turning out to be somewhat naive, Bill Nighy turning out to look exceptional dapper in every scene and capable of portraying his character with the mere lift of an eyebrow. Emma finds herself in unfamiliar circumstances, out of control, without options. The elegant rug pulled from under her. A fine mess she's got herself into. This really isn't my kind of thing, but I enjoyed it all the same. It's pretty forgettable though and I'm sure the book is much much better."
178,This adaptation brings out the worst in the characters...I'm pretty sure Clueless was truer to the spirit of Emma
179,"I went into this movie with no expectations whatsoever, I'm a huge Jane Austen book and movie fan. You have to give this movie a chance and have no opinion about it before you go into it. I think this is one of the best made films I've ever seen. I've watched it three times and each time there is so much more detail, emotion, Artistry, well thought-out storyline and pace that it is nearly a masterpiece."
180,"Beautiful colors, scenes; Like classical fine british paintings. Only slightly slow paced. So why not look at beauty at least once?"
181,"While watching this interpretation of Jane Austin's novel I couldn't help but think about the similar comedy and the bits they did in the movie Clueless (very loosely based on the book). It's my belief that if you like that movie, you are going to like this movie as well. This movie is a combination of the two to make a comedic period piece. I laughed a lot while watching."
182,"I am verrry fond of the miniseries and the Gwyneth Paltrow movie, but this movie left me feeling cold out of the theater. Clearly I set my expectations too high. I just saw it again this morning and I like it a couple of stars more (7 now). I think this version has less mirth, but more in visual appeal. I felt a little more sympathetic to Ms. Woodhouse today."
183,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Perfectly cast. Incredible screenplay. Costumes perfect. Directing right on. Humor well placed. Beautiful scenery. etc. etc etc. Wow.
184,"I've watched a few adaptations of Jane Austen's ""Emma."" This is a very good addition with its confectionary color scheme, and many kinds of lighthearted deliveries to match. Even the famous love confession was a bit lighthearted.I liked this adaptation. Austen's earnest male onlooker characters (like Mr. Knightley) are always breathless to watch. Emma here is well chosen, with her pristine look and graceful manners. Emma in the book is quite young and perhaps for the first time the actress quite looks it (I do not know her age).A good cast, with some oddities. Miranda Hart as Miss Bates was perfectly awkward and lovable. Mia Goth made a fine Harriet Smith. Emma's silly, hypochondriac father was played by the rather too healthy, poised and austere Bill Nighy.I agree Mr. Knightley looked a bit young, and for some reason this film played up his athleticism with an early nude scene for him. I don't know why they made a point of it, and it was odd to sexualize him. I am actually not sure that any nudity has been seen before in a Jane Austen adaptation (even Emma shows her posterior briefly for some reason). Mr. Knightley is a romantic interest, but also someone who always has Emma think of what is proper, so it is just a bit out of type.Anyway, this adaptation takes other liberties, like more intimacy and kissing than probably was actually acceptable for the time. But I enjoyed it anyway, and the film fulfills other fantasies like a wedding scene and etc. I'd watch again."
185,"What a charmingly delightful movie. Zero expectations going in and honestly I was really surprised with how well it worked.Emma. manages to really do something that I think a lot of other period pieces like it have failed to do in that it really makes everything seem so similar to modern life while at the same time holding true to the period it draws from and in doing so runs these wonderful parallels that are such a unique thing to see. It's beautiful to look at, all the performances felt on the money.My only big knock was that it felt MUCH longer than it's two hour run time. There came a point where I started looking at my much and couldn't help but ask just how long this thing was?! To then discover it's just two hours was a real surprise. Admittedly the long day I'd had may have played into that but all the same it felt like it dragged out. Besides that, this whole thing, the ""Clueless for this Generation"" idea, it doesn't do much for me. I never really connect with these movies for whatever reason. I can acknowledge the obvious skill involved they just fail to resonate with me.In short, Emma. is a very solid movie, a surprisingly well done film that, aside from some minor pacing issues is likely to be a home run for a lot of people that give it a chance. I, sadly, am going to end up in the minority there but even so it's hard not to at least like this. It's absolutely worth watching, worth renting even if that's how you have to do it."
186,"Full disclosure, I haven't read the book but I've seen all the adaptations and this one is my favorite. The motivations are clearer, the characters are drawn better. Check it out."
187,"This is a film to forget even for those who clearly worked so hard on it. The outcome just has no purpose. Its only slight saving grace ( which was the reason for giving it two stars) was the cinemaphotography, which was at times very good. But as a story, screenplay, drama, or even as they claim, comedy, it fails totally. Not one character is appealing, you therefore care little what happens to them. The storyline meanders along, giving no sense of tension. There are injections of jauntiness that appear disconnected to the rest of the script and performances. The theatrically named director, Autumn de Wilde, seems to have misjudged just about every aspect he had control of. Thats a death sentence for any movie."
188,Even the horror with G. Paltrow is infinitely more juicy. This is an unclassificable boring parody without any depth. But thank you for giving us Callum Turner's lips and cheekbones to endure the pain.
189,"The latest version of Emma is like the previous one released in the cinema back in 1996.A playful movie of spoilt privileged Emma Woodhouse, a manipulative matchmaker.The self interested young woman who is ultimately humbled as she falls in love herself.It purports to be satirical. Only the modern set Clueless managed to convey the essence of Jane Austen's novel.Maybe this is a difficult book to adapt. I thought despite the sets and production values this Emma was turgid as hell.I thought the 1996 version was a bit boring. This was really boring."
190,"I thought this was a delightful interpretation, perhaps a little reminiscent of a Coen brothers movie. Emma is my least favorite of JA's novels and I believe her most flawed heroine. This production was refreshing. The scenery, detailed clothing (dressing and undressing) and music score was masterful. I was a bit disappointed in how stilted Bill Nighy's portrayal of Mr Woodhouse was. He had irreverent moments but could have been so much more. While I can see why some people are disappointed, I welcome any effort to keep JA's work alive and bring it to the attention of younger generations."
191,"Amazing mood and music, just like a book, I cried at the end. It makes me think of a calmer world."
192,"Slow, ponderous, devoid of any humour. It interrupted a nice nap I was having half way through. Seriously, it appears whoever has done this adaptation has missed all of the humour and nuance of the original book. The acting is good, the lead is actually really quite good as Emma. However it's just missing anything to drive it along."
193,"Moderately succeeding as it tries to find a middleground between modern-day comedy and sumptuous costume drama, Emma is an enjoyable and undeniably pretty watch throughout.It does at times hang heavier on the side of costume drama than witty comedy, and struggles to really engross in its early stages. But, with gorgeous visuals and strong performances, plus a great final act, it proves a thoroughly delightful watch come the finish.Now, I've always been one of those people to shy away a little when it comes to big-screen costume dramas. Too often is it a genre that priorities quaint production over genuinely engaging storytelling, regularly coming off as a little bit like style over substance.Saying that, however, there has been a delightful rebirth in recent years of the costume drama, taking the tropes of classic stories that have been adapted on the big screen a thousand times and injecting a modern, almost anarchic energy into the mix.The best example of that is director Whit Stillman's brilliant Love & Friendship (adapted from Jane Austen's Lady Susan) which, along with gorgeous costumes and production, is an absolute riot throughout.And that's what I felt Emma was missing at times. It's an undeniably beautiful watch, with director Autumn de Wilde's background in photography shining through in the form of beautiful production design, but it's not the non-stop laughterfest that Love And Friendship surprisingly proved.Of course, these are two different stories with differing levels of comedy, but Emma tries to replicate that anarchic approach to Austen on the big screen, and often comes up rather short, never really sparking any big laughs with quick-witted jokes or a sense of gleeful sarcasm.So, as a comedy, Emma isn't a perfect film, but it really comes into its own when it comes to delivering a classic costume drama story. I went into this film hoping for yet another anarchic Austen adaptation, and while the film doesn't quite manage that, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed its faithfulness to the original story.Once again, the lack of comedic zip does mean that the film's themes on high society are less entertaining, but when it comes to romantic intrigue, Emma is a thoroughly enjoyable watch.Particularly in its second half, when we see the meddling Miss Emma Woodhouse meet her match, the film develops a number of pleasantly entertaining romantic storylines that all tie up wonderfully come the finish. It's not a groundbreaking story, but it delivers classic Austen fare in genuinely delightful fashion, without the need for sarcasm in the process.The fun factor of that romantic intrigue is bolstered by a fantastic lead turn from Anya Taylor-Joy, who plays Emma Woodhouse to perfection throughout. With a delightfully ambiguous blend of self-absorbed vanity and still likable characteristics, she's always an interesting watch, and it's a genuine delight to watch her on a rollercoaster of romance throughout.The whole cast is excellent, with memorable supporting performances across the board, but Taylor-Joy is an outstanding lead, bringing the strongest energy and often the closest semblance to a sarcastic, modern approach to Austen in the film as a whole.As a result, there really is a lot to like about Emma. It's far from a perfect film, and lacks comedic energy and ingenuity throughout, also struggling with an often muddled first act.But, once the film gets into its stride, it really impresses with enjoyable and pleasant romantic intrigue, backed up by engaging characters, great performances and utterly gorgeous production and costume design. It doesn't suffer from style over substance as many other costume dramas do, but delivers classic Austen fare in delightful fashion throughout."
194,"Watched the film, then read the novel synopsis, seems a fair adaptation. Truth be told the story is dull as ditchwater, the dialogue corny, way to much reliance on overlong stretches of dance routines. But for the terrible dialogue the actors do their best, Ana and Mia pull strong performances, the annoying personality Miranda Hart actually steals the show with the picnic scene. I would have sooner followed the background story of Fairfax and Churchill with Emma poking her nose in as a support character. The use of traditional folk music and period music was a highlight. The production values are good. My conclusion is that life was probably more interesting and fulfilling being a penniless pauper struggling than living life in the monied upper middle classes with the same people at the same parties day in day out."
195,It's early 19th century England. Carefree 20 year old Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) comes from an upper class family. She befriends lower class girl Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) and tries to set her up with the local vicar Mr. Elton instead of tenant farmer Mr. Robert Martin whom she sees as too low class. She fails to see the reality of the situation and George Knightley (Johnny Flynn).This is a costumed comedy. It's more Brit quirky than laugh out loud funny. There is something within the material which really bothers me. It's the overbearing influence of differentiating the classes. We're supposed to support Knightley's pairing of Harriet and Robert but the reason for the pairing is problematic in today's world. The morality of maintaining the classes is completely flipped around over the last two centuries and that makes the story problematic. I want to root for Knightley's pairing but I hate the reason for it. The purest moral and emotional hit has to be Emma's callous comment to Miss Bates. Those sequences pack a more powerful emotional gut punch than the rest of the movie combined which gets often entangled by the class system. I wish that the movie tied a prettier bow for that thread at the end.
196,Not the best adaptation of Emma I have seen. The characters are not developed at all - Emma comes across as spoiled not the caring person from the book. Bill Nighy as her father was a weak character who I thought would have brought some comedy.
197,"No part of this movie moved me, and I cry at almost everything. Some parts were funny, but not nearly as funny as the director clearly thought they were. The nosebleed was disappointing as we never truly got to see Emma uncovered, vulnerable, and in love because of it. She never returns Knightley's affections in any verbal sense and it's disappointing. The dynamic between Frank Churchill and Emma is utterly confusing. She is clearly thinking of him as a potential partner for most of the movie, and yet the turning point when she no longer loves him but considers and suggests him as a suitor for Harriet is all but indiscernible. If I didn't already know the plot of Emma by heart, I would have been utterly confused by the Emma-Jane Fairfax- Knightley- Frank Churchill quadrangle situation.
It's funny that I say I wouldn't have been able to understand this plot if I wasn't already so familiar with Austen's work. Throughout the film I thought that this resembled nothing of the heart and true moral education at the forefront of Emma, and so must only be entertaining to those who do not know Austen well and approach this story for the first time. (Probably insensitive of me, but that's what I was thinking while watching the film.) Instead it was all turned into a cartoon with inexplicable amounts of cakes and bouquets and bonnets in the background of every scene. It was practically suffocating. Jane Austen is funny, of course! But I felt this was a betrayal of how very serious Emma is at many points. In previous adaptations, the scene in which Knightley reprimands Emma with the sharp ""Badly done, indeed!"" is both clearly well-deserved but also imparts to the viewer a sense of Emma's shame. We both feel indignant at Knightley for speaking to Emma in such a way, and yet know he was right to do so as the secondhand embarrassment for the viewers after seeing Emma's cruelty to Miss Bates is practically unbearable. In this version, I was too caught up by being utterly confused by the relationships everyone in the party was currently having. The plot was both sped up and slowed down for no reason. Why does Knightley run to confess his love to Emma the night after the ball she throws for Frank Churchill? It's so he can be there when Frank Churchill strides in, having rescued Harriet from Gypsies. This is all very confusing as it happens on the way home from the ball - this is when Frank decides to return scissors to Miss Bates? It doesn't make sense and all feels entirely too rushed. (This is presumably thrown in as a detail from the book which hints at the degree of familiarity between Jane and Frank.) Nothing about the visual language suggests Frank's feelings for Jane, when many other adaptations do this very well.
When Emma confesses to Knightley, ""My blindness to (Jane and Frank's attachment) led me to behave in a way that must always make me ashamed"" I was trying to work out the internal logic in my mind. The viewers are not really shown anything that should make Emma particularly ashamed other than her cruelty to Miss Bates in one particular instance, and nothing about Frank's behavior could have led her to make her cruel statement. Her attachment to Frank is never shown in such a flagrant way as to make her feel ashamed. In other, more logical adaptations, it is Frank and Emma's incessant and obvious flirting that causes Jane to make the statement that she is ""wearied in the spirits."" Which, of course she is! This is the moment when the viewers, and Emma, are finally supposed to feel some sympathy for poor Jane Fairfax, though previously Emma had only been irked by her. This gives clues to the viewer of Jane and Frank's attachment. The news that they are in love, and that Frank is SO MUCH in love with her as to overcome his aunt's wishes for him to marry a lady of fortune, comes from somewhere BEYOND nowhere in this adaptation. There is no indication from anyone of anything between Frank and Jane. In other adaptations, Knightley is adept and observes their intimacy and tries to warn Emma that he thinks all is not as it seems between them. But she ignores him and says she perfectly understands Frank, leading Knightley to believe she is in love with him. This all makes sense as to why Knightley is so concerned and hurt for Emma on hearing the revelation of Frank and Jane's engagement as to rush back from his visit to Isabella and John in London to console her. It's for the same reason that Knightley leaves to visit London in the first place. The emotional tension created by all this misunderstanding is completely lost in Autumn de Wilde's adaptation. This makes the plot feel like trodding through a set of bullet points with no motivation from one event to the next. (I found myself bored at many many times in this film due to the lack of proper emotional tension.) Yet, she maintains the same dialogue as if we were supposed to believe the characters were that emotionally tense when in fact none of it has been shown. Before I go on too long about the misplaced internal logic, let me simply add that I did not find the depiction of Isabella and John's marriage as unhappy helpful in the least. It wasn't funny, it wasn't necessary... it was just a stupid contrivance for cheap laughs. There is no sign that Isabella and John are in an unhappy marriage in Austen's narrative. Like Emma and Knightley, they have grown up together as neighbors and knew what they were getting into when they married. It is in Isabella and John's happy marriage and family life that Knightley and Emma find much common ground to discuss in the novel. Again, this is all thrown away from cheap laughs as Isabella is portrayed as a raving hypochondriac.
Anya Taylor-Joy does such a good job at portraying Emma's arrogance and vanity that I find that was the lasting picture I had of her throughout the film. Even in her most humble moment, after being charged seriously by Knightley for cruelty to Miss Bates, she just whines like a teenager and I feel. No. Sympathy. This could have maybe been helped if the awful and ridiculous nosebleed hadn't taken over the proposal scene, when Emma is supposed to reveal her true feelings, saying something like: ""I do love you. I've loved you all along, but I never knew myself. How blind I was."" (Refer to Austen's stellar novel for the real version of this confession, obviously.) instead, in this version, she is given an inconvenient nosebleed which she must defend herself from. She walks off to sort things out between Harriet and Robert Martin and I feel that no big romantic moment has occurred. I must add that the kiss scene between Knightley and Emma between the screens shielding Mr. Woodhouse was charming. Had it not occurred, I would hardly have realized that the impending marriage between Knightley and Emma was more than a business deal. I felt it a discourtesy to Bill Nighy's Mr. Woodhouse that we weren't shown the scene when Emma and Knightley actually reveal to him that they are getting married; this adaptation skips immediately to the wedding.
Knightley's performance was fine, but not what it should have been. I had no sense of Knightley's being 16 years Emma's senior, and thus speaking to her almost as an older brother for much of the story. They bickered more like siblings and it felt that his lecturing of Emma was pompous, considering on how very equal terms they seemed to be. This could have been helped by a line of dialogue mentioning their age difference, but nothing of the sort was to be found. This seems to be part of the trend in the whole adaptation of making this story more appealing to someone of the 21st century, rather than accurately portraying Austen's story of a, well, slightly paternal relationship becoming, to everyone's surprise and delight, a romantic one. This is the charm of Emma. But I guess Autumn de Wilde found it to be too gross for a modern audience. It is this adaptation's loss, I believe. But never mind. Look to the superior 1996 adaptation by Andrew Davies starring Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong for the best version of the transformation of Emma and Knightley's relationship from paternal to romantic in a way that is never icky. It's a feat. Before I move on to other performances, it's silly I know but I have to say that Knightley's inability to brush his hair almost ruined every scene he was in. Why, in the name of God, did it HAVE to look so disheveled? Why? Was it an attempt to make Knightley look young and sexy? It just seemed to treat the audience as dumb. Thrown in messy hair, and you have your love interest! Please. Do better.
Miranda Hart's Miss Bates is a highlight, too cartoonish for Austen but just cartoonish enough for Autumn de Wilde. It is much the same with Josh O'Connor's Mr Elton.
I must praise the production. It is a beautiful film clearly shot by a photographer. The costumes are almost (thinking of 2 of Emma's costumes which made me gag) perfect. Most made me comment out loud on their beauty to my mother while watching. The production and cinematography and costumes are so beautiful that I feel it overwhelms and emphasizes how much the story doesn't have good pacing (in this version, but not in the novel and in many other adaptations.) The production contributed to the whole film feeling like a ridiculous macaroon which the viewer was invited to live in for two hours, and then return to a real world afterward. This is not what Austen is. She is a moral person. She is concerned with the education of her readers. The production, in my opinion, overcame any chance of this happening. This story seems more concerned with letting us 21st century viewers know that the 18th century was different, weird, and unrelatably ridiculous. All in all, I must recommend this as a visually pleasing but emotionally shallow and logically confusing adaptation of Austen's comedic masterpiece. Who would have thought you could make Emma TOO funny?"
198,"The costumes and scenery of this film are lush and rich, and the cinematography is fantastic, but there was something about this film that made its pacing plodding when compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow/Jeremy Northam version. That is not to say that the 2020 version is not enjoyable, but the humor And wit of the 1996 version is lacking. Bill Nighy's portrayal of Mr. Woodhouse is oddly soulless. Anya Taylor-Joy is lovely, with deep dark eyes that seem to feel every tear, but none of the wit and twinkle of Ms. Paltrow. Jane Austen lit purists May favor this one, but t rank it below the 1996 film. See it for yourself anyway. It's still a gorgeous movie."
199,"Emma is film that is very nice watch and i had a good time experiencing it,this film has maybe a pretty slow story going and plot is very artistic and old fashioned and that can be to much for people who were hoping for a fast moving plot,but in the end i was satisfayed with final project,anya did a good job as a lead character and she was my main reason to watch this film since she is one of best young actresses out there,emma also did a good job at worldbuilding and exploring world around them,lets not forget also that costumes and dresses are very good designed and very nicely to look at,i dont know how the book and movie measure up,but emma was a good film to watch"
200,"The snag with so much of Jane Austen's works is that they are delicate, intricate and rely on the written word to slowly evolve the characterisations, and therefore the plot. This film makes the ultimate climax to the story as plain as the nose on your face from the get-go. Once we are in on that, it becomes an exercise in damage limitation as our true loves navigate their route to a happy ending. In this respect, though this film is beautiful to look at; the costumes are first rate and the photography in/around England's Gloucestershire country houses is gorgeous - the delivery of the story falls rather flat. It is interesting to see Josh O'Connor and Callum Turner in morning dress; Miranda Hart tries hard as the sort of ""Mother Goose"" figure and it has moments that reflect the comedic nature of the original; but overall it is just a rather pale imitation of the book. It's a good twenty minutes too long and the score is intrusive - even at the most delicate or poignant moments of the film, music frankly interferes with the imagery"
201,"Aside from many of the actors not knowing how to deliver the lines, this could have been so lovely! The costumes are lovely and the scenery I as superb! My biggest qualm is Emma! This actress did NOT capture her likeness. Maybe it was an acting choice? Emma should not be a cruel girl or a vindictive one. The actress (who I have seen do well in many other things) totally missed the nail on the head. There was absolutely no charm to Emma...just meanness. Now don't get me wrong, Emma is NOT an angel as she is spoiled and coddled but she has charisma and charm and kindness. So disappointed. I watch absolutely every period piece and simply can't miss one! The main actress was too unlike what the character should be for me to enjoy."
202,"I suppose if you know nothing of Jane Austen you might enjoy this. But when the actors struggle just to get their lines out without sounding marble-mouthed, what's the point? It's a fairly good rule that if it's made by the BBC (et al) than it's good, and if it's a film, it's probably bad. The ""Pride And Prejudice"" mini-series is, of course, the standard. The mini-series of ""Sense And Sensibility"" slightly edges out the Emma Thompson film, and if you want to see ""Emma"", get the mini-series with Jonny Lee Miller. Whatever drove this nonsense here, it comes off rococo -- like a cake with nothing but frosting. There's so little humanity here. The characters are distant, trapped in some weird 21st c. idea of parlor room comedy, and, again, seemingly unable to get their lines out. Oh, how I miss Jennifer Ehle's perfect command of the language. This version of ""Emma"", for all its stately beauty, is such an unnatural take on Jane Austen that it comes off as grotesque -- and certainly uninteresting to anyone accustomed to good period pieces. Just awful. You can't enjoy an adaptation of literature if the filmmakers and the cast are convinced that it's too dense to be treated properly. Laurence Olivier had shown us that even Shakespeare can roll off the tongue with ease. To bungle the Regency period, then, is just unforgivable."
203,Loved this movie. Such attraction and chemistry between Emma and Mr Knightley. Give it a watch and enjoy.
204,"I love Jane Austen adaptations and have seen all of them over the years. This is a very charming and witty take on Austen's most well loved, meddling heiress, Emma Woodhouse. Anya Taylor-Joy radiates poise, puzzlement and sparkle and is a relatable 21st century heroine without losing the19th century character. Her huge brown eyes are truly ""windows to her soul"" and I found her quite mesmerizing. I loved Johnny Flynn as one of the sexiest Mr Knightley's yet and had no idea he was an actor, only knowing him as a folk singer. He is a perfect foil for quicksilver Emma and has no problem putting her firmly in her place. Mia Goth is a wonderful Harriet Smith, loveable, gullible and sweet. Most of the supporting players were excellent with special praise to Miranda Hart for her poignant portrayal of poor Miss Bates - cruelly and thoughtlessly hurt by Emma. The costumes were stunning, the settings sublime, the music interesting (old English folk tunes in the main) and the script crackled things along well. There is a lot of walking about in beautiful stately homes or bucolic country lanes, but that is an Austen trope that seems to be compulsory now. One small gripe was the ""mystery of the pianoforte"", which is usually a big part of any retelling of Emma, was hardly touched upon and Frank Churchill seemed miscast to me. Neither good looking enough, nor charmingly raffish enough to be really interesting as a character. I thought the portrayal of this key character by Callum Turner was a bit flat. Another small minus was although the costuming was sumptuous and on point, Mr Woodhouse, played very charmingly by Bill Nighy, looked more Edwardian than Regency. His trousers were just not right! Overall, the best adaptation of Emma for a long time. Good performances, great locations and costumes and at the centre if it, Anya Taylor Joy's charismatic Emma."
205,"This was a great disappointment. A celebration of the mindlessness of the rich and indolent. A romanticism of the ruling class and their quirks and indulgences. How they suffer, with an inane girl interfering with romantic entanglements.The almost constant soundtrack is close to a music-box of fluff, the sort of thing you might find in an elevator (in fact there is a scene with a music box).I've read some of the Austen sisters (published as Bell) long ago, and was pleased, but this is an insult to the work. There is no humor, the production values are at best average, bordering on a Hallmark effort.I suggest you do not watch this."
206,"Interesting and entertaining but does not live up to the claim of being a comedy.
Not worth the in-theatre experience.
Just read the book."
207,"It was a bit of a change for me to see a film based on a book I'd read. Not the biggest reader ever, so this doesn't happen too often. Anyway the movie certainly captured the mood of the book.The movie tells the story of Emma who enjoys sorting out other peoples love life presumably as a distraction from worrying about her own. Anya Taylor-Joy was very good in the lead role and is well supported by Johnny Flynn and Mia Goth as George Knightly and Harriet Smith. I have to confess that I've rather fallen out of love with Bill Nighy though. He seems to play the identical role in every film he features in.If you enjoyed the book then there's a good chance you'll enjoy this movie. If you still enjoy the quirky Bill Nighy role then you'll enjoy it even more."
208,"Reads like an Emma adaptation made by people who grew up loving Clueless. This version is incredibly romantic, which may be the strongest argument for it being better than, or at least qualitatively comparable to, Clueless...that, and its sheer handsome beauty. Turns out I'm a person who loves well-shot costume dramas, where the script is as opulent as the visuals. Even made me wanna read some Austen...no small feat."
209,"Never read thebook or watched the BBC series. Yes, it starts of terrible slow but before you know it, you are drawn in to the . piece. Her insult of not stopping after three dull comments was terrific and teh dance between EMMA and Mr. Knightly was absolutely epic. The sexual tension afterwards, when she was in her coach and he outside the window, beautifully done.
Maybe because I had no expectations nor prior knowledge of Jane Austen, I was able to find pure joy in this flick and especially was glad with the""Beowulf"" ending."
210,"Before I get to my perception of the merits of this movie, please just let me make one observation.If life for the well born in early 19th Century Britain really was as portrayed here, I just have to say what a vapid and pointless life it would appear to have been.Was daily life for such people really all about marital matches between one chinless wonder and another chinless wonder or was there something else to their existence. Life for the poor, starving and covered with cankers was probably pretty awful but their daily struggle might also have been a bit more interesting than life for the rich, as shown here in this movie.Now, back to the movie. I hadn't seen Anya Taylor-Joy until just recently when I watched ""The Queen's Gambit"" on Netflix. She was just wonderful as the character Beth Harmon in that one and also very good here, playing the part of Emma Woodhouse.This movie is stunningly beautiful to look at. Every shot was carefully framed and beautifully lit, the costumes were gorgeous and the script well adapted from the novel. The result is a movie that's very pleasing to the eye but not quite so easy on the mind. At a little over two hours, I found it frankly a bit boring and I struggled a bit towards the end of the two hours.Emma was entertaining enough for most of its length but I shalln't be hanging out to watch it again any time soon. By all means watch it. It's nice but in my view not terribly interesting as cinema.JMV"
211,"Potentially, this could have been one of the best Jane Austen movies ever. Ithas a talented cast and a good script. It is well directed, and it looks beautiful. So, what could possibly go wrong?
Simple: the score. What were they thinking? The music for this movie is terrible. To begin with, most of it is completely anachronistic. I swear I heard gospel singers; in a movie set in England 1800 AD! Second, it's the wrong type of music. Emma is a romantic comedy wrapped up in a period piece. Too bad nobody told the composer who seems to have thought he was working on an epic drama. The score blasts the audience in the face with all the subtlety of a Wagnerian opera, except that Wagner understood his medium and would never have made this mistake. To make things even worse, the timing is completely off. Dramatic music swells in the middle of the scene as though leading up to a crucial event, except nothing happens. Then there is silence, as though something momentous is about to be said, except nobobdy talks. To make this disaster complete, the background music intermingles with the music that actually occurs in the stort in a way that both confuses and irritates. A small congregation in a village church produces a quoir and orchan as though it's St Paul's cathedral; a quartet playing in a ballroom thunders like a symhony orchestra.This is such a shame. Music can greatly enhance a movie. In this case, it nearly ruins it."
212,"This was one of the worst movies I have seen for a long long time. Ok, I must admit that I didn't pick it by myself but watched it last night during a weekly sneak preview. I couldn't convince my wife to leave the cinema so I had to survive till the end of it - 2 hours waste of my time!This is a girlie movie from the 1800s as it couldn't be worse. Beautiful costumes, lovely set-up and no action at all but one 20 years something blonde rich girl trying to find love ...For all Jane Austen fans and fans from tjjis century, they most probably see it differently but if you consider to watch it for the wrong reason: be prepared."
213,"This film is not a comedy. I did not laugh, and the audience chucked twice. The film is not incompetent in many ways but missed the mark too often. Miranda heart is a great actress and can play both serious and comedic parts- however she was butchered."
214,"I'm fifteen minutes in and I can firmly say this is the WORST adaptation of a Jane Austen book EVER! Emma played by Anya Taylor-Joy is a caricature. She's overly made up, looks bored, and for God's sake where in the book is the scene of her pulling up her dress and putting her bare backside up to the fire?!!!!!Wherever they found this cast is where they ought to deposit them back! Not only should I get my money back, they should pay for the psychiatric therapy I'm going to need after seeing such bad acting!Don't waste your precious time on this travesty!Zero stars!"
215,"I love all things Austen, this adaptation was such a disappointment. Yes the costuming was wonderful, yes the sets and backdrop were wonderful! But EVERYTHING else fell flat. Anya Taylor-Joys Emma was bratty (I mean how many times did she roll her eyes?) The character may well be a snob but she was never intentionally rude (save the Miss Bates incident) Mia Goths Harriet cane off more melancholy than silly as she was in the book and every other adaptation. I literally could go on with each and every character portrayed in this film but suffice it to say no real Jane lover will find this adaptation up to par."
216,A figure in this is briefly shown getting ready to talk about the survivor spirit of a pigeon. 0 time to waste though. Lazerious is shown completely stll in a room with his hair stretching all the way outside. And a man at dennys sips a piece of iron and gets petted on the thigh by leaking water.
217,The only reason I'm even giving this a one star is because it had Anya Taylor- Joy besides that the movie sucked.
218,"It was colorful and SLOW. There were 8 of us in the theater for opening night. Don't see it doing well -- too artsy for the USA. No slavery, disease or jazz hands so won't win awards except maybe costumes. Beautiful scenery and good story well told. I was the only man in the gang. Slow burn about a rich woman in England meddling in the relationships of everyone around her. We all know this girl. Good rental -- on a slow night."
219,"I guess you can rank it as jane austen's grandly satiric 'emma' recast as a vintage hollywood madcap-comedy, in a directorial debut by rock-video auteur, autumn de wilde, broadly drawing upon ernst lubitsch and billy wilder."
220,"Having seen the uninspiring Little Women (2019), I went into this with low expectations. But actually laughed, enjoyed the flawed characters, and was impressed by the overall quality."
221,"Went to see Emma this evening anticipating a novel spin on a beloved story. I got what I came for and then some. A remake of any well loved classic is difficult to pull off but this version was a winner. Bill Nighy was a delightful father to this new Emma- his antics made for a much more light-hearted tone in the Woodhouse home.
Also delightful to see Chummy (Miranda Hart) onscreen again in her role as Miss Bates. She played her with zest and made us like her in spite of ourselves.
In terms of costumes and settings- a gorgeous film. I could have done without the Red Capes ala Handmaid's Tale (!!?) and a certain nosebleed moment (why???) but all in all a great time in the theater. Loved the soundtrack mix. May actually track it down to purchase it!"
222,"I saw this. I'm not going to say it's the worst thing I've ever seen. And I'm going to be upfront and honest by saying that this is not really my kind of movie (although last year's Little Women was great, surprisingly so). BUT: I try to review every movie I have solid to strong feelings about, whether those feelings are generally good or generally not so good. And while I don't think Emma will be an underwhelming experience for everyone, I'm going to do the best I can to explain why it didn't work for me. If other people find enjoyment in it, or if other people even find themselves loving it, that's perfectly fine. I don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing this if they were already interested. Take my words with a massive grain of salt, or like, hundreds and hundreds of regular-sized grains of salt. My thoughts on this movie are just something I have to get out, and write down, and that's just what I do. So I apologise in advance if what I say irks you or completely goes against your own opinion.So I don't really like Jane Austen. If I haven't lost you by now, that'll probably do it. Again, her works aren't for someone like me, from what I can tell. Pride & Prejudice was one book we had to study back in high school, almost a decade ago for me now. I didn't finish it, couldn't stand what I read, and wrote a scathing critique on how dull and not really feminist by today's standards it was, and it ended up one of my best marked essays throughout all of high school. Maybe I argued my point well, or maybe it was just good by 16-year-old standards. I don't want to make any points so bold about this film adaptation of Emma. However, I do want to note that I did go into it with an open mind. It's been close to a decade since angry teenage me got tired of reading Pride & Prejudice and decided to rant about the 40-50 pages of material I did manage to get through. I'd heard this new adaptation of Emma was decent, and I've always liked Anya Taylor-Joy (she's definitely going places, although that was already pretty obvious by now). So I had an open mind, was hoping maybe I'd be open more to a Jane Austen work at the ripe old age of 25, and...I didn't come away very enthusiastic at all. My main problem- one that again, I'm sure not everyone will have- is that this story just seems so pointless. Especially now: I was sitting there wondering why we needed a movie like Emma right now? I didn't know what it had to say, I didn't know what it could teach anybody, I didn't see how it was relevant to the issues and themes that are currently on people's minds. It makes me think that maybe this is escapism: that it's a light, frivolous movie without too many stakes that people can enjoy in a comfortable cinema for two hours on a weekend, or the evening after a hard day at work. My problem there then becomes admittedly an even more subjective one: to my own tastes, this just isn't entertaining. This isn't a fun movie to me. The humour is so mild and polite that I was genuinely puzzled most of the time when the audience around me laughed. There didn't seem to be any clever subversions, or critiques, or real satire of the upper class. It was just people in mildly embarrassing situations, or Bill Nighy looking endlessly bewildered whenever someone did something a little bit pretentious. Drama? Barely any of that to me either. It's not difficult to work out where the movie is going, and when it starts to get a little serious in its less humourous final third, the drama is so petty and so easily resolved that I just wondered how anybody could get invested enough to care.I don't know why I get so annoyed at something that clearly is very mild, but I couldn't help thinking that every single person watching in that cinema would have had something more interesting that's happened in their life, compared to what was unfolding on the screen. Everybody has a funnier personal story, everybody has likely experienced more tragedy, everybody has had more of an emotional rollercoaster at some point in their lives that would make for a more gripping, more cinematic experience. Emma is largely about a group of (mostly very wealthy) people dealing with what are ultimately very small, insignificant struggles. We don't get the sense that most will be much worse off at all by the film's end should things not work out for them. The title character acts a certain way throughout much of the movie without much of an explanation, beside literal text taken from the novel shown right before the film starts. And when she inevitably shifts her feelings and outlook on life, it's both predictable and also somewhat out of left field. I didn't get a strong or satisfying sense of progression or development out of her character.If the film overall was funnier, it wouldn't need to be dramatic. If it were more dramatic, it wouldn't need more than a couple of funny Bill Nighy looks every now and then. If it had something to say, or something it wanted to critique, or a way of exploring something relevant or thought provoking, I could forgive it for not being particularly engaging in a funny or dramatic manner. If it had some amazing performances, or some absolutely stunning visuals, then I could recommend it in that regard, but technically it's really just competent. Taylor-Joy is good but she just about always is. Nighy is funny at times but he just about always is. The film looks nice enough but it's got so much going on with its costumes and period sets and colours that that's just about inevitable.I haven't really ripped into a movie that's technically not terrible before, but for the most part, watching this movie and just knowing that it exists in place of other more interesting work that the filmmakers and cast could have been working on bothers me. Based on my past experience of not liking Pride & Prejudice, I am fully aware that this might just not be for me, and it could well be as simple as that. But my feelings are strong, and so I've done my best to explain them. This felt like a big nothing of a movie that while technically competent, for me personally doesn't say anything insightful or new, doesn't evoke any emotions, doesn't entertain, and doesn't absolutely wow me on a visual level. It's such a nothing of a movie for me, but hey, if you've got this far and were already set on seeing it as an Austen fan, don't let my rant stop you. There are movies I love that aren't particularly thought provoking or dramatically original, but are enjoyable as basic entertainment for me personally. Emma could well entertain others in a similar way, but for me at least, I genuinely did not feel that way."
223,"Whilst not incompetent, too many times did I feel it miss the mark. There are things to enjoy in the film, however- I am in no rush to see it again.Miranda Heart is a great actress however- I felt like she had been done dirty."
224,"""Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition,...""Where is the beauty in this movie?
Anya Taylor-Joy is not handsome at all. Her appearance is repulsive."
225,"If you haven't seen the old movie or read the book you will not understand a lot!
It's the same thing as the Little women, the old movies are way better!"
226,"I saw Emma on valentine's day with my girlfriend, mother, sister and sister's boyfriend. The film, while briefly enjoyable in some areas of comedy, is a complete bore that nobody should be forced to watch in the theater.This film fails to entertain even the most avid romance fans such as my sister and girlfriend who both fell asleep during the viewing. This is in no way a terrible film, but I truly believe it should have been directly released on a streaming service and does not deserve a theater run."
227,"This travesty has all the subtlety of a music video. No surprise that the director made her mark in the music video world. The characters move as though they are choreographed to the music. The photography is terrible; everything is brightly lit and shot in symmetrical composition. There is no nuance to the images unlike the visual splendor of Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility or the 1996 version of Emma. It's all done in the ""Look at me, I'm so clever"" school of film making that so many young directors today belong too. I like Jane Austin a lot; this drivel isn't even worthy of Jane Doe."
228,"I was so excited to see this movie. Being a HUGE Jane Austen fan and seeing every adaptation of every book I can get my hands on - I was vastly disappointed by this film. Though the costumes were beautiful and the characters looked from the outside to be perfect, the scriptwriting left the first time watcher confused and the Austen fanatic disappointed. This movie was dry, the scenes cut and pasted together, and many plot points ill explained. Jane Fairfax and Frank Churchill's arch's especially neglected."
229,"I am going to be repeating many other reviewers here, but it's the truth. This movie was beautiful! The scenes, the costumes, it was all just wonderful to watch. However, that is about where it ends. The music was weird, and jarring at points. I'm listening to a calm meadow scene, and then bam, some weird bluegrass country music starts blaring out. The tiny, sharp hair ringlets of the main characters and the freakishly tall collars on the men are very distracting. I liked the actress who played Emma, although she was a little meaner than I believe Emma is. I was not a fan of Mr. Knightley, however. It's not that he cant act, it's just...He doesn't look anything like I would picture Mr. Knightley looking. Some scenes he looks like a baby, and others, he just looks old. And not in a good way. If you want an amazing adaptation, I would recommend the mini series with Ramola Gaori."
230,I agree with most of the comments. The visual beauty kept me hanging on for half the movie but the lack of unified chemistry was the turn off point.
231,"This film is beautiful, the cinematography, music, sets and costumes are all so beautiful! They instantly transport you to a different place. I've read Emma and I strongly disagree with a lot of these reviews saying that the movie is shallow. I found there was amazing chemistry between Johnny Flynn and Anya Taylor-Joy, I thought Bill Nighy was endearing as Mr. Woodhouse, and all the other actors were great too. I find a lot of Jane Austen's novels quite cold, as in I find it difficult to sense any emotions from her characters because she writes so matter of factly. So I really enjoy this adaption because I was actually able to see and feel emotion from the characters. Movies are time restricted, we all know they can never cover every storyline from the book, I think they covered the most important parts and it came together perfectly."
232,Had to watch it for Mother's Day and it honestly was a great way to catch up on some sleep.
233,"Every filmmaker/artist/musician of any worth knows that sometimes you get a brilliant idea and it fits and its great, sometimes you get a crazy idea and it distracts from the main thing you are trying to get across. The trick is to know which it is. The bloody nose Emma has in the pivotal scene when Knightly is (?) declaring his love (?) is such a thing. It should have been killed before it got on screen, since it steals the focus from that one scene, that the entire movie has been working up to. I am still wondering why would anyone in their right mind want to distract from that moment? What possible purpose did an outpouring of blood from Emma's nose have? I thought she was having a brain hemorrhage and needed to go to hospital.I was suddenly in a modern era wanting to dial 911. The rest of the scene just faded away and all I could see was her bloody nose.
That is one example of the many times this film left the excellent qualities Jane Austen is revered for - brilliant banter, sparkling dialogue, wonderful character, and in Emma, a great comedy of errors - to shine a light on extraneous nonsense that really did not matter. The result is a confusion of ideas, weak characters and a less than riveting movie. The music is another such abstraction. When you have something as good as Jane Austen's Emma, just stick to the script.
Update: Apparently the director put the bloody nose in to show that Emma and Knightly are just 'hot messes' and because he gets nose bleeds all the time. That tells me he didn't trust Jane Austen's carefully laid out characterizations of the two main characters to show us who they are, and he didn't trust his audience enough to understand the characters without a show of blood. Emma is intelligent and witty, but she is young and impetuous (perhaps like the director) and Knightly is older and the voice of reason. It is because he is older that he restrains himself. So, much as I liked the actor who played Knightly, I think the casting was off and they did a disservice to the original material by not contrasting the ages of the two main characters. The director also says Knightly is a mansplainer. Not true, He is older and wiser. His sex is irrelevant since a female character could have easily reacted in the same way to Emma's outlandish behavior and given the same advice. Knightly is one of the few voices of reason in the novel, and the only one with the station to make Emma listen to reason.
I feel as if the director took a quick glance at his material and said 'roll em' without ever understanding the elegant balance of contrasting personalities and mistaken ideas in this great work.
The scenery and costumes are pure eye candy, it's worth watching it just for those, and the acting is very good, exceptional mostly."
234,"A good period piece depicting the aristocrats during that time This is a movie to bring your girlfriend or wife to and she will love it and you will enjoy it Anya Taylor-Joy is a refreshing young actress that brings appeal and poise to her role. It's quite amazing how much we've changed since the early 1800s until the 21st century. Altogether, this movie gives Jane Austen's work A very nice transition to the big screen. If it's your partner's turn to pick the movie, go you will enjoy it."
235,"Emma is a cheerful adaptation of Jane Austen's beloved novel. Readers of Jane Austen can rejoice as her characters come to screen. Others might not find this to be their cup of tea.In this adaptation the ""handsome, clever and rich"" matchmaker Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor Joy) pursues her adventures through matches and romanticism to find love.Anya Taylor Joy, as Emma, gives the best performance. Anya has grown from a being newcomer and this demanding performance proves that, allowing for eloquent speaking and characterization. Her conversations with other characters are straight out of the classic Victorian tale; keeping in mind, she is American. Her love interests are Johnny Flynn as Mr. Knightley, a dashingly critical friend, and Callum Turner as Frank Churchill, a rich gentleman. I also enjoyed Mia Goth as Harriet, as she helps Emma find her match.Director Autumn de Wilde is artistic, but the pacing could be tighter. This is a slow movie as several scenes are long, drawn-out conversations. I feel this aspect is best achieved in books, though some movies can capture the audience's attention like that. This movie really must be your forte for it to be enjoyable. The character's parlance is always olden English, and there is a loss of stakes. The score by Isobel Waller-Bridge is authentically Georgian capturing the grounded roots of genteel women living in England.The message of this film is to not rush love, as Emma and Harriet let time prove its worth after hasty pursuits. I give this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18, due to brief nudity, even though younger kids might not be interested in watching this.Reviewed by Arjun N., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org."
236,"This is yet another ""classic"" I have not read - for the record, apart from Shakespeare, who I love, I don't 'do' pre-20th century fiction, which means that names like Eliot, Bronte(s), Thackery, Dickens, Smollet, and, yes, Austen, are just that, names to me and little more. On the plus side I enjoyed the way that half the cast were constantly being dressed by the other half against semi-lavish backgrounds as Bill Nighy phoned it in. I nodded off a couple of times and left little wiser story-wise than when I entered. Apart from that ..."
237,"I have seen some filmsin my time, but this takes the biscuit. I hated this film. Boring boring boring. I would rather have watched paint dry and that's saying something. Worst film ever, no story to it at all. The op only person I liked was the lady who plays Miranda. Now she was funny"
238,Horrible. Anya Taylor-Joy's Emma is thoroughly unlikeable and never cracks a smile once. I persevered to the end but wished I hadn't bothered. The 2009 BBC/Masterpiece version is infinitely superior and a joy to watch.
239,I am a man of a certain so this film was probably not aimed at me but having seen Little Women and thought is was very good I gave Emma. a go. Hmm.....apart from being 30 mins too long it was in my opinion very very boring. Nothing happened (except for the last few scenes) and the story seemed to be in a loop - disappointing. Sets and costumes all excellent - just let down by a dull story - sorry folks
240,"This is beautifully filmed, with stunning scenery and costumes. Emma isn't a particularly likeable character, arrogant with an over inflated opinion but I felt the others parts weren't allowed to flourish in their own right, with the exception of Miranda Hart as Miss Bates who played her with amazing vulnerability. A pleasant way to spend a wet and windy afternoon but lacks the latest David Copperfield's charm and humour. The music was also too much and unrequired for the most part"
241,"I must say, first half of the movie I haven't like it a bit. As movie moved on, I kinda enjoyed it. Few times I laughed so hard, but to be honest, if you miss this movie, you won't loose anything."
242,"Mr and Ms Churchill were great. The father of Emma was great. Harriet Smith was beyond great. The aunt of Miss Fairfax was fine. But Emma was awful, her cousin was fair, Frank Churchill was awful. These characters were the worst I have seen in version of Emma and they and the diurector ruined the film. It lacked tension. I have seen this plot fourtimes and never did it lack everything before. The music was great but inappropriate. In short every version is better than this though the good actors were great but they did not make it worth seeing this worthless version."
243,"Emma is a swing and a miss, but I still had a nice time. I've seen a few different versions of Emma and I haven't loved any of them. I don't think it's Jane Austen's best work. However, I'd take the 1996 version with Gwynith Paltrow and the 1997 version with Kate Beckinsale over this one. I give the director credit for doing something a little different. This version is a bit quirkier than the others and has a dry humor to it. The father played by Bill Nighy did make me laugh. The movie looks great due to the costumes and the way it is filmed. However, I think the two main characters were miscast and Anya Taylor-Joy's Emma was not particularly likable. When it gets to the famous scene where she's mean to Miss Bates at the picnic is doesn't work as well because it's not out of character. She needs to be a likable person that is doing something unexpectedly mean. The scene only works if you know a good person just said something bad and embarrassed themselves. Is it dramatic or awkward when Trump says something mean? No, it's just what we expect from him. There's no drama or surprise to it. I heard a female movie critic say that Johnny Flynn was very attractive, but he didn't seem like a Mr. Knightly to me. I could see him being a really good Mad Hatter in Alice in wonderland. Normally I don't really second guess the casting, but in this case, both of those characters felt wrong to me the whole movie. I did like Mia Goth as Harriet. When she smiled, she lit up the whole screen. Gemma Whelan is great too, playing a part very different from the lesbian pirate, Yara Greyjoy, from Game of Thrones. She's really good in Gentleman Jack as well. Well done g-Emma, well done indeed."
244,"I watch every Emma adaptation, and was looking forward to this one. Right away the costumes and sets were amazing to see on the screen. However, just as quickly, I realized that there's an underlying snark masked as wit to it. From the period at the end of the title and chapter titles, to Anna Taylor-Joy's overly-directed facial reactions.I know that Emma, as Jane Austen wrote, ""would not be much liked by anyone"". However, every other version manages to make her likable by portraying her as more oblivious, rather than having a superiority complex. Not here though; it was successful in making Austen's statement true. Harriet and Ms. Bates are played well here, but every other character's portrayal are almost cartoonish. Mr. Knightley is certainly not the older gentleman in this version.As a story, I would have been confused as a first-time viewer. It was disjointed, seemed to focus on the sumptuousness rather than the arc and relied on music to convey tone. It concerns me that this is how period pieces will be filmed from now on.It gets a 3 from me only because of the visuals, but overall, I'm disappointed. I ended up fast forwarding through it, because I was bored. The 1996 Emma is still my favorite, and the 2009 BBC version far outshines this one."
245,"I loved it and added an welcome edge. But for me, Johnny Flynn was completely miscast. It didn't ruin the film, but took a little of the shine off of it."
246,"Such good cast....such a dull, witless waste of time and talent. Don't waste your money."
247,"I love this Jane Austen story, and I loved Gwyneth Paltrow's ""Emma;"" a little spoiled and bossy, but also sweet and caring, and ready to change. I did not get this from this re-make, sadly. I found Mr. Knightly almost boring, and I didn't buy that he and Emma were destined to be together. There wasn't much chemistry between these lead actors although there were some funny parts, which I did appreciate. But overall, the heart of the story was lost to this modernizing attempt. Sometimes sticking with convention works! Give us characters we can care about and cheer for!"
248,Love Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma. Don't really like what's-his-scratched-face as Mr. Knightley. Frank Churchill should have been a more handsome actor. Miranda Hart as Miss Bates was interesting - if only for a little while. The Miss Bates in Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma was the best. And Ewan McGregor was Mr. Knightley in that one for goodness sake!!! Now THAT'S casting.
249,"My wife and I have read the book and watched the other Emma movies. We enjoyed this movie so much. Costumes were great, every scene was beautiful. We kept pausing the streaming to examine detail. I really liked Anya Taylor-Joy. I've seen her in other things but she made Emma come alive for me. Another joy was the soundtrack. Excellent. It's unfortunate the virus cancelled theater showings but it forced an early streaming release which was just the thing for us in cities with a shelter in place ordinance. Highly recommend."
250,Boring and painful to watch. Definitely not a comedy.
251,"This was 2.5 hours wasted that I will never get back. Perhaps it was the comparison to the excellent recent adaptation of ""Sanditon"" but this was just a mess, in my opinion. With a silly musical score and hyper-stylized staging, this almost came across as a stage play being filmed.
There was audible snoring in the theatre!"
252,If you are into English houses and Classic Victorian costumes then this the movie for you. The acting was great and everything flowed with scenes. I loved the set designs and Victorian houses. The only surprise was it didn't list the houses at the end where the movie was shot. We had to look it up on IMDb. Why wouldn't they list the houses? In the theatre we could hear another patron say the same thing.
253,"""What are you thinking of"" is not proper English, even by today's standards. It sounds like a line in My Cousin Vinny that Mona Lisa Vito (Marisa Tomei) would blurt out.Was the word, ""Picture"" even used at that time?It had its funny parts but you need to listen very carefully. I'm afraid that this movie needs subtitles for today's youth."
254,"This new adaptation of the classic Jane Austen novel seems to be getting mixed reviews, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.With a good central performance from Anya Taylor-Joy, and good support from Bill Nighy etc, this managed to combine humour with period drama well.Good stuff, in my opinion. I don't know what others wanted/expected."
255,"Emma. (2020) was directed by Autumn de Wilde. Jane Austen's novel was published in 1815. Two hundred years later, the novel still is wonderful. (OK--not Jane Austen's best novel, but still wonderful.)Emma can be successfully transformed into a movie, but this isn't that movie. Director de Wilde is experienced, but primarily in TV. Anya Taylor-Joy, who portrays Emma Woodhouse, is red hot right now, as the star of The Queen's Gambit. Playing Emma will prove to Hollywood that she has a broad range of talents. Well, that was the game plan, but it didn't work. She's definitely a 21st Century woman, dressed up in 19th Century costumes.In the novel Mr. Knightley is much older than Emma. Johnny Flynn who portrays Mr. Knightley in the movie is, indeed, much older than Emma, but he looks like her contemporary. I'm sure that he's glad that he's so youthful looking, but it doesn't work in this movie.Bill Nighy, who plays Mr. Woodhouse is an outstanding actor, but he too is miscast. In the novel, Mr. Woodhouse worries about everything, not just drafts as portrayed in the movie. Nighy is calm and steady--he doesn't adapt to the role of the dithering Mr. Woodhouse.An actor who deserves praise is Amber Anderson, who portrays Jane Fairfax In the film. Anderson performs the third movement from Mozart's Piano Sonata No. 12 on the fortepiano and she's not dubbed! This is even more of an astounding accomplishment, because Anderson normally plays the piano. She had to relearn the piece on the pianoforte, which is a similar--but not identical--instrument.The soundtrack of the movie is unusual. Director de Wilde has chosen some wonderful folk music performed by outstanding folk artists. However, the songs on the soundtrack were played with no apparent relationship to what we were seeing on the screen. It's almost as if de Wilde reached into a bag of songs and threw whatever she happened to find into the soundtrack in a random fashion. Very strange.If you are a Jane Austen superfan, you may want to see this version of Emma for the sake of completeness. Otherwise, I would avoid it. Emma. has a weak IMDb rating of 6.7, but I didn't think it was that good, and rated it 5."
256,"I decided to watch this after falling in love with Anya Taylor-Joy's performance in The Queen's Gambit. Taylor-Joy in the lead role struck me as a can't-miss, Emma had received glowing reviews, and I've been a fan of other Jane Austen adaptations in the past.However, it became obvious within the first ten minutes of Emma that the director, Autumn de Wilde, had no clue about the language of narrative filmmaking. Shot choices and sequences seem random, the camera often jumping around in a scene so much that the viewer becomes disoriented. Characters appear out of nowhere, yet you are expected to instantly understand their relationships to other characters. One can almost see the performers' growing sense of dread as they realize that they are not in good hands.In short, Emma looked like it was directed by a film student, not a skilled feature director.I have since read that de Wilde comes from a music video and graphic arts background, which explains a lot. Directors who come from this sort of background tend to struggle with narrative filmmaking, and they are often just plain awful at it.Some directors from this type of background, like Michael Bay, manage to cheat their way through by creating images that are at least visually arresting, even though their skills at shot sequence, composition, and editing remain horrible. De Wilde attempted something like this, but it falls flat. In an interview, she said that she wanted to add visual humor to the story. But visual comedy is hard to pull off, and in the wrong hands it can be terrible. De Wilde's effort was typical of the latter. Having the actors make silly movements and gestures in front of a wide-angle lens might ""look"" funny, but when unconnected to a visual narrative it's just annoying. The cast of Emma looked so ridiculous that I began to feel embarrassed for them.(By contrast, the director of The Queen's Gambit, Scott Frank, spent decades as a screenwriter, working with skilled visual storytellers such as Steven Soderbergh (Out of Sight), Barry Sonnenfeld (Get Shorty), and Steven Spielberg (Minority Report). His understanding of the craft shows in every detail of The Queen's Gambit, which rarely strikes any sort of false note.)Will de Wilde take the lesson? I doubt it. Obviously, a memo went out to the press, so the reviews are glowing and the interviews fawning. De Wilde will probably make the mistake of believing that she's arrived. She hasn't, and I suspect that the execs who backed this dumpster fire know the truth.I nevertheless give the film two stars because I could watch Anya Taylor-Joy read a newspaper for two hours. Her beauty is other-worldly."
257,"Okay, I saw a feature for this movie in Vogue prior to its release, and now I know why. Another reviewer called the costumes and sets ""sumptuous."" Yes, that is the word.However, all of the characters were caricatures. Even the brilliant Bill Nighy and Rupert Graves couldn't do much with the weird lines and characteristics their men were assigned.
I was disappointed, too, by the foolishness of Elton and even Harriet. They are, admittedly, both foolish in the novel, but in there it's at least believable that Emma might return Elton's affections, or that Knightley might return Harriet's. In the movie, both characters were way over the top, so there was no real tension driving the plot forward, which is a disservice to the subtleties of Austen's fiction, I think. I won't even get started on the fake news that was Frank/Emma's coy flirtation.I could go on but I won't. All I'll say is watch the BBC miniseries with Romola Garai as Emma. Vain and arrogant though Emma Woodhouse may be, at least you won't detest her within the first five minutes."
258,"I have seen all versions of this masterpiece. And I can safely say that this might my favorite so far. It is tied with the BBC miniseries. Why, you ask. For the humor alone. This one is so much more fun than it's predecessors. The acting is fabulous. While it might take creative liberties, it still follows the book. Like the 2008 Pride & Prejudice, it still holds a candle in the Austen world.I really loved Johnny Flynn's Mr. Knightley more than Jonny Lee Miller's, which is a total surprise because I really love Jonny Lee as an actor. There's something about Johnny's take on this character that really holds true to the book version especially when he chastises Emma. The actress playing Emma grew on me, I was hesitant at first because she didn't seem like someone who could pull off the character but she does.I'm glad I watched this version because it's not just the actors but the visuals are very appealing and very British as it should be. 8/10"

Well, welcome to the fictional village of Highbury of bittersweet emotions, vanillin fields, confused romances and doll faced brides-to-be?
Just like the cherished protagonist's name, this movie is delicious, handsome and rich, savored with pounding hints of strong waywardness here and there!Phenomenal acting by the mesmerizing Anya Taylor Joy, this exquisite Georgian melodrama is the best weekend feast of February 2020! (if you love Jane Austen's classics)Sprinkled with an aura of enchanting elegance, the wardrobe game is too, too good to be true, the dainty quotient of Emma's dresses is overwhelming, I simply could not take my eyes off!A movie to must watch if you love to turn time and land in this quaint dell of imagery, love and illusions timelessly tangled into a bejeweled romantic movie"
260,"I like Austin so I gave four stars, and the movie itself may only give me three stars. The role is good, can reflect the character of the character, but it is a bit too hard, is the expression of the heroine a bit stiff, her friend Harriet should be simple rather than an idiot. But the English manor had a good view and was pleasing to the eye."
261,"I anticipated this movie very much because I read the book not so long ago and I must say I liked it. The music, the costumes, and interiors are all beautiful, the acting is very good... I loved how Bill Nighy portrayed Mr. Woodhouse (even better, I think, than he was written), but what I didn't like is that Emma is not so mean in the book, just stubborn, but maybe that's just how I saw it, and I don't know why they painted her sister so unlikeable, because in the book she is described as lovely and kind but a bit paranoid girl like her father. Everything else that they changed were small but good changes. Overall I think it's beautiful movie and definitely worth watching especially for Jane Austen fans.
I'm sorry for my grammar, English is not my native language."
262,"Loved: Great, entertaining supporting characters. Mr. Westhouse, Mrs. Bates, Ms. Fairfax. Mr. And Mrs Elton were great! Johnny Flynn was great as Mr. Knightley. Sets, homes, landscape- all the visuals were fabulous! I also really liked the fresh take on a few of the scenes and events. It was fun to see scenes I am familiar with portrayed in new ways.No, No, Just No: I am sorry to say I did not like this Emma. This Emma was hard, cold, and selfish in a way that made me not care a bit about her. There was no sweetness and kindness that Emma, as portrayed in the book, has. Also could've left that changing scene out. It was unnecessary and seemed out of place."
263,"A thank you note to Emma (2020)Gratitude. Never has a Jane Austen story been told in such a way that discriminating readers and viewers can celebrate: charming and beautiful characters, dressed and staged exquisitely, with storytelling that is true to the affectionate nature of the author and her most beloved heroine. The film is a portrait of literary beauty with a modern charm that can be enjoyed by all.The director gifts us with an intimate portrait of our favorite characters, drawn from the parlors and pastures of Austen's England, in a way they have never been shown before: gritty and gorgeous, personalities punctuated, framed by unique artifice and edifice. This Emma is perfectly cast, lit, and dressed, down to the last button. Natural light, expensive clothes, large fires, exquisite windows, and lush greenery; every frame delights. It makes previous portrayals-though painfully more authentic in ways-seem paltry in comparison. Is it loyal to the original Austen? Well, it is an interpretation, surely, but the liberties taken with the storyline serve to make it more emotional, more fun and what may actually be more authentic to Austen's ""teachable moments.""Thankfully, there are no ugly wigs, ill-fitted-200-year-old-dresses, frumpy bonnets or bad horse-riding to distract from the loveliness. There are no cardboard sets, sloppy table designs, or boring men. There are no musical mis-steps or shortcuts taken in floral arrangements, boots, cakes or necklines. There are no shiny trousers, fake babies, or waifs to offend. Thank you. Avoiding pitfalls of so many prior tellings, easy, right? But here is the surprise, not only are the period considerations done with more thought and care, the characters are more likable than ever. The serious Mr. Knightley became more likable by casting a ""tortured rockstar"" type to play him, so there is that. Emma Woodhouse is very fine and likable in a pretty and popular Clueless kind of way. More than ever, we ""love to look at her!""The side characters are likable and compelling but somewhat compressed, newcomers to Emma will wonder at the details of the Bates Family for instance. Development of the Bates and Churchill connections was lacking. The Jane Fairfax Mysteries could be a miniseries itself? Anyone? The allure of this interpretation of Emma is not thoroughness of story or depth of characters, but a perfect balance of beauty in face and bonnet with a story that compels. Something previous Austen filmmakers have never quite managed with finesse.Even more, this telling illuminates why Emma is so enduring today. Relatable human struggles like 1) caring for elders, 2) beloved siblings living far away, 3) the lost sense of identity when displaced, and the 4) difficulty of finding equal friendships. Stating these difficulties directly in the script, was not wholly unwelcome and, indeed, true to the original. Another refreshing change is the lens placed on the central romance as Emma and George plan their own live-together-at-Hartfield ending with pleasure instead of pain. Even here, Mr. Knightley's being an ""indifferent"" lover doesn't feel indifferent. It feels different, a first.Blood, perfectly placed, thank you. A very clever treatment of the cliche of an Austen proposal scene - breaking it up with a bright red reality check. Emma urgently exits the marriage proposal to reconcile her mistakes, clearing her conscience before jumping on the proverbial satin couch with the man she and her dear friend both admire. Movie Emma seeks forgiveness with a newly learned compassion; a modern telling, but more satisfying than the sending of her lowly friend away to wait-it-out in London, a painful process to endure in the book. Notice how a simple handkerchief was written into the scene to deal with blood, passion and class-struggle, no zombies required. The handkerchief metaphor also a nod to ""Janites"" who find civility a salve for modern bloodshed.A rewarding companionship concludes every Austen story, and it is through self-reflection that Emma discovers her own feelings - in every version. For better or worse, companionship as it is understood today must reflect that the physical and emotional selves are inseparable. As a reader of Emma, integrated characters are easily drawn by applying one's imagination to the timeless situations within. The difficulty is bringing a ""whole"" Emma to the screen. One must decide for oneself if the liberties of dressing oneself, face-to-face reconciliation with Mr. Martin and embracing are welcome developments (and revolutionary writing) of Austen's themes. Some may feel the exploration of the characters' physicality on screen gives offense to the morality of Miss Austen. Then we remember how Jane's writing was sweet and edgy for its time, describing little intimacies no one had written so well before. In that pert spirit, the movie characters show glimpses into their natural states and desires, little intimacies that can be considered handsome, clever and rich, indeed.The beauty of the photography, the actors dressed and coifed to perfection, the story fun and flowing, bewitch our senses and satisfy us that we were always right: there is a proper way to tell an Austen story on screen. And this is it. It is a story of Sensual Sensibility, told with more sense and less awkward taste than any before. Emma must learn how to care about each person around her before she can close her eyes and feel herself...whatever the viewer imagines. This viewer imagines she feels grateful. The joy of gratitude is a perfect lesson for the most-lovable, Selfish Girl in literary history. And for all of us. Thank you movie-makers and Jane Austen."
264,"Yes. The reviews are correct. This has so much potential and may visually stunning with some cool cinematography. But these shallow and poorly invested characters draw you only to roll your eyes with each scene. Absurd, aloof, clueless and vacuous characters that look and sound smart cannot make up for the fact you can barely tell who is who and why they interact. We still can't tell who is who and why they are interacting. Does the director assume everyone has read the book and screenplay before watching? Absurd. The movie's director has build a visual version of the book and has assume that all 300 million Americans read it yesterday. That is offensive to the art of cinema. If your college class just read and reviewed the book, perhaps this will help you visualize. For the other 99.9% of viewers, it's as confusing as having walked into a room of people speaking a different language.... but they do look well doing it. I may have preferred this film without sound as the characters.Try again shallow film team. This could have been good. I'd like a refund ($19.99) and 2 hours of my time back. I paid $20 for a gourmet dessert and got a fluffy Twinkie."
265,"Just another movie that when you speak your mind, you suck at life... Empathy is overrated"
266,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Emma. is Autumn de Wilde's feature film directorial debut, as well as Eleanor Catton's screenwriting debut. I never watched any previous adaptations and period movies aren't exactly ""my thing"". This doesn't mean I can't appreciate them! The Favourite and Little Women are the most recent examples of films belonging to said genre that I absolutely love. The main reason why I felt the need to watch this adaptation was Anya Taylor-Joy's first time as the sole protagonist.I genuinely believe she'll become one of the greatest actresses of her generation, along Florence Pugh, Chloë Grace Moretz, Hailee Steinfeld, Kaitlyn Dever, Saoirse Ronan, and a few others. Her performance in this movie is yet another argument to validate my prediction. She's phenomenal as Emma! It took me a while to get used to her voice since she applies a much higher tone than her usual one. Seeing actors doing different accents is pretty common, but changing their voice as Anya does, even if it's a simple modification, it still shows how committed she was to her role.As cliche as it might sound, she carries the whole story on her shoulders. She's the link that connects all storylines and characters. Without her, the film doesn't work, so her display had to be near-perfect. Anya demonstrates her range and emotional ability, as well as a seamless control of the complex and rich script. Most dialogues possess long sentences with sophisticated vocabulary, something only the best actors can deal with effortlessly.Anya shines, but her character does too. Emma's arc is quite interesting. Besides being ""handsome, clever and rich"", she has no respect for the poor, manipulates her friend's romantic decisions, and sometimes acts in a very selfish, arrogant manner. Her transformation into a better person is the most captivating arc of the screenplay, but it also demonstrates my main issue with the movie as a whole. Ten minutes in, and I knew everything that was going to happen.Now, I always try to avoid thinking too much ahead. But when it comes to relationships between characters, it's all so predictable and obvious to me that I can't help but guess the whole story. The same screenplay trick is used throughout to twist certain relationships, becoming repetitive and a bit dull. I never felt truly invested in the film until the one-hour mark. It's mostly well-paced, but when nothing is surprising, innovative, or creative regarding the overall narrative, there's not that much that can keep me captivated.The first act is a tad confusing, with too many characters getting introduced too fast. Honestly, I just discovered while writing this review that a secondary character is supposed to be blood-related to one of the main ones. Story and characters are the two pillars of any movie. I've always written this. If these two don't work, then everything else crumbles. It's far from collapsing, it's actually very well-structured, but it's like these two pillars are just like thousands of others. There's no distinct characteristic that makes these unique.Weirdly enough, I never felt bored. The cast really does a nice job of keeping me entertained by every remarkable performance. Bill Nighy (Mr. Woodhouse) and Miranda Hart (Miss Bates) are quite funny. The costume design is gorgeous besides being extremely important since it actually elevates the story by clearly identifying who's rich and poor. Production and set design are fantastic. Great cinematography (Christopher Blauvelt), and an enjoyable score (Isobel Waller-Bridge and David Schweitzer). Nevertheless, as outstanding as the technical achievements might be, the film still lacks a unique directing style, which is normal, having in mind it's the director's first feature.All in all, Emma. doesn't reach the latest period movies' level like The Favourite or Little Women, but it's a fine start for debutants director Autumn de Wilde and screenwriter Eleanor Catton. Anya Taylor-Joy delivers an exceptional performance as a very well-written Emma Woodhouse, carrying the film on her shoulders until the very end, cementing her place in Hollywood as one of the greatest actresses of her generation. The rest of the cast is also pretty great. The costume design steals the ""technical show"", but the production level in this movie is impressive. However, the narrative lacks surprising elements, making the existence of this new adaptation a bit questionable. Why make another film if there's nothing unique about it? Predictable from the get-go, confusing first act, and very hard to feel invested before the one-hour mark. If you enjoy period comedy-dramas, I recommend it. Otherwise, the two movies mentioned above are probably a better choice...Rating: C+"
267,"Emma is depicted as unfeeling and insolent with almost no chemistry between Mr. Knightley and Emma - this seems to lead to lacklustre performances from all characters. The true highlights are the beautiful set designs, costumes and its whimsical cinematography which far exceed its predecessors. It had all the environmental artistic elements but the lacking depth of character that connects Austen with its audience leaves us feeling that something was missing. Even the witty banter is plain and dull. Disappointing."
268,"I'm not a big fan of the novels by Jane Austin. But, i do enjoy the movies adapted. ""Emma"" is a quirky, fun little period piece about a 21 year old stuck up match maker that loves to interfere in other people's lives to make sure she's in control of her social status. Without anyone actually succeeding in out staging her in anyway. The movie seems simple. Though, it twists and turns. And has alot more to say. Which i believe could've mostly been trimmed down. This could've worked as a tv show. Or a much shorter film. This was an hour long story that was stretched to 2 hours. By the hour and twenty mark. I felt really bored. Because, it didn't feel like much was accomplished. There were funny gags and interesting ideas thrown in. But, never anything that made the viewer sink their teeth into. The cinematography is absolutely stunning. And the actors did their job exceptionally. However, the script was too bland for it to be memorable."
269,"Everything about this film is beautiful! Every set is thoughtfully laid out, every set is beautifully composed, and the people are really pretty too. It is a joy to watch."
270,"First Hit: This version of the Jane Ashton tale, isn't very funny, somewhat long at over two hours, and, at times, oddly entertaining.I'm not a big fan of period pieces, and this one spends a lot of time showing us how the class structure and social hierarchy in England produced rude behavior.The rude behavior is characterized by having the people guessing what others think and then respond without knowing what they really think. The culmination of this lack of communication is when Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) and George Knightley (Johnny Flynn) are under a tree, having extreme difficulty telling each other how they feel about each other.The innuendos, the backhanded slights, and the occasional direct put-downs throughout this story were, on occasion, amusing. Still, mostly they struck me as arrogant attacks on people who had less social standing than others.Emma is a rich girl in her early twenties, living in a large house on an estate in England. She lives there with her father, Mr. Woodhouse (Bill Nighy). It is near a small town, and because of her wealth, she's looked up to by everyone in the village. When Emma walks into a store, everyone bows or curtsies. She hires friendships and people to spend time with her; Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) is one such person.We watch Emma try to influence and control who gets engaged to whom, including Harriet. Emma is devoted to her father and has no intention of ever marrying. Emma is also forever being prodded and challenged by Knightly, her neighbor.Knightley lives in a vast empty estate by himself. Interior shots of the house show most of the furniture covered up.Although I didn't like the character, Taylor-Joy was good as the arrogant Emma. Nighy was appropriately clueless as Emma's father. Flynn did a terrific job of being the rich neighbor who suddenly harbored deeper feelings for Emma. Goth was sublime. She portrayed innocence and faith that Emma was looking out for her in a beautiful way. Eleanor Catton wrote this screenplay, that to me, was way to elongated. Autumn de Wilde directed this movie. It was at least 40 minutes too long and uninspired.Overall: Despite the brief moments of hilarity, it was painfully long and contrived."
271,"The costumes and cinematography were beautiful, but that is the best I can say about this movie. Being a Jane Austin fan, I was very disappointed. The dialog and story line seemed to be discarded in favor of just a pretty picture. I had to go re-read Emma to get the bad movie out of my mind."
272,"Reasons to dislike, per other reviews: 1. Brief backside nudity. 2. Odd choice of mismatched music, both foreground & background. 3. Doesn't follow the book.
Reasons to like: 1. If the brief, admittedly pointless, scene of nudity bothers you then you must have been born & raised always fully clothed. 2. Music was odd, but so was the story. 3. Often said, per some unknown rule, when text is interpreted into ""moving pictures"" that they are to be both creative & mechanistically identical.
My complaint is that I had to sit through an hour+ of someone who reminded me of a current political leader, i.e. vain, arrogant, selfish, controlling. The only things lacking were vague repeated exaggerations like ""very very""."
273,"This film start with a young girl ""Emma"" choosing a flower to sent to a woman ""Miss Taylor"", and she attend Miss Taylor wedding ceremony scene! As turnout, this film is a love story of Emma and her friend ""Harriet""! Entire film full of boring conversation! The overuse of the song singing at the background scene, also make the film unwatchable! Barely laughable scene is, Jane playing piano, after the singing perform by Emma! At the end, Harriet marry with Robert Martin, and Emma marry with Mr. Knightley! That's it! Another disappointed film!"
274,"Wasn't bad, but I didn't really understand what was happening."
275,"Methinks some raunchiness has been added to Emma's tale of romantic misdirection. It's light, it's slight, but mostly faithful gentle entertainment. Effectively an historical feel good film for those with gentile feminine sensibilities."
276,"I'm literally in the theater typing this on my phone:Wow is this little Emma girl annoying...
Idk what is so fascinating about her and why pppl listen to her? She really has nothing to offer but bad advice.Also it's a huge mess of a love triangle? Why do these women not speak their truth and just say the name of the person they have a crush on???!This is ridiculous, is this what it was like back in the day? All this ppl just pretend to be proper English lady. Lmao I hate this so much, someone save meeeeee"
277,"I don't appreciate the mere PG rating this receives despite full rear male nudity. Obviously this has nothing to do with the film, but rather the raters of it thinking a PG rating is sufficient. Although it is the films fault for thinking naked men serves well to the plot when it never does. I also saw it was not at all funny despite it conveying as such."
278,"I literally hate it. I sat through the first hour and cringed at most of the acting, the style of the movie, the awful music. You have no idea how huge it is that I gave it a 4-star rating out of 10. Normally, I give 8's-10's. This is how much I detested the movie. Whoever came up with this vision for the movie should be restrained from ever filming another Jane Austen movie--forever."
279,"Im not exactly sure what it is about this film, maybe the writing or the direction I dont know. But this version of Emma fell a bit flat for me. The choice for Knightly did not seem like the right choice. They could have found someone so much better such as Theo James. He would have fit the part very well. Anya didnt seem to have the opportunity to shine in this like she did in The Queens Gambit. And the jarring out of place music was just odd. Other versions of Emma felt much more life like and fun. Other versions of Emma make her much more bubbly, vivacious and this one she is more snotty and not as interesting as a character. In fact all of the characters did not seem to exhibit as much depth. It was a pleasant film overall and beautiful to watch but I think they could have done a lot better."
280,"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Charmless but pretty.JIM'S REVIEW: Emma. (without the period) has been a continued source of pleasure for the fans of Jane Austen. Many film and television series adaptations of her novel about this strong-willed independent heroine has been done, the best still being the Gwyneth Paltrow film in 1996. This recent addition lacks the wit and comic misadventures. Charm is also a missing factor in this mostly miscast but somewhat entertaining version.For those unfamiliar with the story, rich Emma Woodhouse plays matchmaker to her friend, Harriet, with disastrous results while avoiding matrimony and love herself. The story is a sharp commentary on romantic relationships in the 1800's and the social class structure of England. Emma's meddlesome nature provides the satire and female empowerment viewpoint of a wealthy heiress who flits away the days manipulating those in her circle. The film does depict this aspect with confidence.Directed with no real flair by Autumn de Wilde, the main issue is the screenplay by Eleanor Catton. It follows the novel's intricate plot efficiently but loses all the comic entanglements and interrelationships of her characters in the process. As adapted, these characters are lacking depth and never carry the effervescent needed for this comedy of manners. The film looks lovely, with fine cinematography by Christopher Blauvelt and especially lavish period costumes created by Alexandra Bryne.Perhaps the main problem is a central casting issue. In the title role, Anya Taylor-Joy is joyless. She captures Emma's spoiled lifestyle and pettiness well, but is dead weight with her comic timing and charm. She seems to have a perpetual pout throughout the film. Showing no charisma opposite her is her love interest, George Knightley. As played by Johnny Flynn, the character is in need of more dash and vigor. He is bland as white bread, barely a scone either. Most of the other cast members add little excitement to their stock roles. Only Miranda Hart and Mia Goth seem to have a screen presence. Even the talented Bill Nighy is wasted as Emma's doting father.Emma. is a nice try at bringing this period comedy to a modern day audience. (Clueless (1995) actually did a better job with that approach.) However, that little period does signals the updated nonsense and sensibilities of this mishandled remake. You just can't make something work without the right chemistry between the two mismatched pair of actors in the lead roles, despite all the sumptuous trappings that surrounds them. Period."
281,"I would love for this movie to have served past the Gwyneth paltrow version. Sadly it feels like nobody told Taylor that she was in a comedy. The music says she's in a comedy the costumes say she's in a comedy. A lot of the dialogue says that she's in a comedy. Bill nighy certainly knows that he's in a comedy. but I think that Emma should be a little bit more understood and likable, even if she is an outrageous snob through most of the story. I just felt nothing but coldness from the beginning of this movie.I'm not saying it's bad but I am befuddled."
282,"Before seeing this, Kate Beckinsale was my favourite Emma on film. Now that I've seen this new version of the story, Kate Beckinsale is still my favourite. Followed by Romola Garai, then Gwyneth Paltrow. This version adds nothing to the canon, and it's hard to see why it was made."
283,"I don't know what I just watched but it wasn't Emma. If you're going alter every event, character and emotion then just make an entirely different movie."
284,"I wasted $5 renting this movie on iTunes. I debating renting it for a long time because I am usually a big fan of period dramas. I was so disappointed, and I didn't even finish the movie before the rental expired. That's how much I didn't care. The film gives you no reason to care about any of the characters or their lives. The main actress who plays Emma is also annoying, I'm sorry but she just doesn't seem right to be in a period piece. Emma Stone would have been a much better choice. Anyways, once again please take my warning and don't watch this movie, it will just be 2 hours of your life you won't get back. Speaking of Emma Stone, watch ""The Favourite"" instead. It has beautiful costumes and characters that actually have personalities."
285,"Sad, with such a talented cast they truly missed the opportunity to pay homage to Jane Austen and they didn't."
286,The characters are deep and develop nicely. Ofcourse I assume this should be a credit to miss Jane Austin although I haven't read the book. The scenery and colors in the movie are beautifully mesmerizing as well as the hair and makeup. I wanted many times throughout the movie to pause the screen and feast my eyes upon the interior designs of houses or sometimes on beautiful landscapes. The light comedy was also nice and the harmony the music score added was on point.
287,"For all my fellow Jane Austen fans, I watched the new EMMA. (yes, the ""dot"" is part of the title!) on AppleTV last night for the first time. So... my verdict... I liked the new version ""ok"" when we watched it last night, but now I'm watching it again a 2nd time since I've got it rented for 48 hours.
And this 2nd time, I absolutely love it! There were things I wasn't sure I liked the first time because they were so novel, but in this 2nd viewing, I see the director's absolute genius. And Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart are brilliant! Watch it and give it a second try, if like me, you were sceptical the first time!Edit: I'm watching it a 3rd time during my lunch. I'm truly loving it! I love the tongue-in-cheek perspective that the director gives us! Wasn't sure of that during the first viewing, but now I think it is exactly as Jane intended!"
288,"The director, being an artist by trade, has taken this latest version of the beloved story of Emma. and made a movie that is an art piece itself.All of us who know the story already, know that emma is, well, a spoiled brat. She is arrogant, selfish and naive but good hearted as anyone would expect of a twenty year old rich young woman of Jane Austen's time. The director has taken care to make sure that the mood of the first half of this film mirrors that of the title character. All the rooms, interactions and conversation feel rather synthetic and great detail has been put into the superficial. The result is quite spectacular.As the film progresses, so too does the heroine who becomes continuously less ""unfeeling"" through very hard lessons and the criticism of course of Mr. knightly. The change is so gradual to the mood of the film that you will not notice it has happened. You will simply find yourself in love with the film around the same time that you find that Emma is a red blooded human like us all.I just want to add that no version of Emma that I have ever seen before made me believe so wholly the love between Emma and her man. The movie, by the end of it, feels incredibly real and human."
289,"But cold protagonist.I just couldn't wait for the film to finish.Otherwise nice costumes of the era,nice music and scenery.Watch it with low expectations.I suppose Emma with Paltrow is much better."
290,"This is the first time I've had any exposure to Emma., so I cannot attest to previous incarnations of this film, but I can say that this one is really good. The colors and art direction are really unique and the film is just pure pleasure on the eyes. I was a huge fan of the story, dialogue, and cast as well and I thought everyone did an excellent job. If you're on the fence, watch it!"
291,"Excessively lengthy at over two hours, Emma can drag (particularly in the first act), but strong characters manage to find their footing as the story progresses. The inconsistent pacing can be felt throughout, but fantastic sets and costume design along with cleverly written dialogue will prove a rewarding watch."
292,"Why the remake with Hallmark Channel type actors. Nothing new from the other version with Paltrow. If someone hasn't seen this before, it could be enjoyed for the stories sake. Woodhouse and Knightly ... meh. Odd actor pairing, Just didn't buy what they were selling. Miranda Hart and Bill Nighy kept my attention."
293,"While this is not the best adaption of the novel, it is probably the most enjoyable. De Wilde approaches the film with a light touch and the actors are allowed to carry the film. Bill Nighy is especially great, which is amazing because he was not given much to work with. Taylor-Joy is the glue that keeps this whole production together. She is likable, charming, spoiled, and human, relatable even to the modern audiences."
294,Had a Old Time Blast Seeing This One. A Very Colorful Movie with Great Style and Costumes!! Loved all The Women's Hair In This Too! The One Unique thing about this Film was it was a Romantic Comedy with Not One Sex Joke. It is Rated PG. This Movie Proves You Can Have Fun and Not Be Raunchy. There Needs to be More Movies Like This.
295,"I've seen numerous adaptations of this Jane Austen classic. The earliest version I'm aware of is a 1970's TV version with Doran Godwin. The 1990's were rife with Emma adaptations, ranging from a modern take on Emma in the film Clueless, the 1996 Gwyneth Paltrow version (fairly accurate to the book with a beautiful score by Rachel Portman), and a 1996 TV version with Kate Becksindale. There was a more recent TV version in 2009 with Romola Garai.How does this version stack up? It was a light-hearted, enjoyable romp, filled with great character acting performances. It was not as accurate to the book as some other versions, but it did not deviate so much as to be unforgivable.A lot of the success of any adaptation of Emma pins on how successful the actress is at portraying her. Emma is perhaps one of the most flawed of Austen's heroines, spoiled and rich, but not necessarily ill-natured. A lot of Emma's flaws come out of her youth, isolation, and inexperience. She's never really been challenged. Any actress playing her has to show the flaws while still being appealing. Anya Taylor-Joy is rather cute in the role, so is able to negotiate that tightrope of being a flawed, yet appealing character.The characters of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax are underdeveloped. I felt 1996's Ewan McGreggor did a better job in playing a charming young man who may or may not be a little less than completely honest.Bill Nighy and Miranda Hart were a riot as Mr. Woodhouse and Miss Bates. Miss Bates' role in the novel is quite pivotal. She has huge verbal torrents of streams of consciousness that reveal things Emma is blind to, yet this talent is not picked up upon in the movie. Many of her ramblings provide clues to secrets later to be revealed.The actors playing Harriet, the Westons, the Eltons, and the John Knightly family were all reliable in their roles.So this gets us down to Mr. Knightly. Mr. Knightly's portrayal was not was I imagined Mr. Knightly to be. Johnny Flynn reminded me just a little too much of Kristoff from Frozen. Any moment I thought he'd take off and sing a duet with Sven the Reindeer. And what were with those high collarpoints? He could barely turn his head. Mr. Knightly is a man's man, not a dandy. I was rather smitten with Jeremy Northern's Mr. Knightly from the Paltrow version, but perhaps he was a little too handsome to be Knightly. Knightly is the only person who can keep up intellectually with Emma -- Frank Churchill is close, but a little too much like her. I was looking for a little more sparkling wit. Still Johnny Flynn is a credible actor. Knightly is more observant than Emma, but has his blind spots.The audience broke out in laughter several times during the movie. All in all, an enjoyable romp. Not perfect, but good fun."
296,It was a tall order to remake this Classic so hats off to the effort. The costuming and cinematography hit the mark. Transportation was well characterized -- carriages versus horse back versus walking ... the you-are-what-you-ride theme was enjoyable. Johnny Flynn and Mia Goth were spot on. The Irish undertones were pleasing. Everything else left me wanting.
297,"A very funny and enjoyable rendition of the book on the big screen! It looks great and the lead, Anya Taylor-Joy, really brings the character to life with a charming performance. The film is very visually appealing with great sets and cinematography. The director opts for a simple and focused take on the book and the film is quite a pleasure, even if it lacks some of the depth and complexity of the novel."
298,"The costumes, hair and makeup, and decoration badly upstage the performances and plot, though it still manages to retain most of Austen's commentary, nuance, and humor. The sound track is emblematic of this disunity, shifting without much rationale between the most flippant little tinklings, the sacred, and folksy. About half way through, Emma's unusually repulsive shallowness and arrogance gave way to some sympathy and insight, and my revulsion at the mise en scene surrendered to the subtle warmth of Nighy and Anya Joy' relationship. Weird disorienting experience."
299,All her dresses are so beautiful. The decorations of each set scene are so elegant.
300,"A fairly enjoyable couple of hours but could have been so much better, Anya Taylor joy was good as Emma, the costumes and the settings were perfect but something was missing from the film as a whole, was a bit of a disappointment on the whole, if you want to go and see a period comedy go and see the personal history of David Copperfield instead a much more satisfying experience"
301,"After watching this I was not sure if liked it or not. This is beautifully made film. Costumes, sets and everything is spectacular. It's a quirky take on the story, much more opulent that other versions, and also a little more risque and fun. If you know and love the book and older versions, you might find this representation a little jarring. The version of Miss Bates, as not seemingly very poor at all, the father as much more energetic, less lovable, draft loather and the general conceited nature of most characters. What is also lovely in this version is the time given for Harriet's character to have a full exploration of her story. Why not have a different take on the story, I like all the previous versions in different ways, I will give it another go, it might become a favourite. I would like more of these films made."
302,"""Emma."" (2020) is a light historic comedy / drama movie, directed by Autumn de Wilde (American photographer and film maker, of other movies like The Postmen Dreams and Rilo Kiley), based on a 1815 book of the same name by Jane Austen, which incidentally already had a 1996 film of the same name (with Gwyneth Paltrow, Alan Cumming, Toni Collette, Ewan McGregor). The adaptation was made by Eleanor Catton (from the newly released New Zealand series ""The Luminaries"").The movie, which is said to be very faithful to the book (which I have not read), follows the life of Emma Woodhouse, a wealthy family girl in the countryside (of the social class landed gentry who lives on rents and had a huge country house) from England of the Georgian/ Regency era, who in her small town have a hobby as the matchmaker for her friends and family - sometimes with disastrous results. It is a slow movie, but adequate to the century that it was written, but not so adequate to our current era standards, being almost entirely based on dialogues. The film is somewhat slow and dull till halfway, when it begins to get more interesting by the clumsy situations that Emma creates.In the cast, Anya Taylor-Joy as Emma (Peaky Blinders, Slit, Glass, The Witch), Johnny Flynn, Josh O'Connor, Callum Turner, Mia Goth (Suspiria, A Cure for Wellness, Everest) and Miranda Hart. All with competent performances, especially in a movie with a more theatrical and speech-based style; Anya have a good performance, with the facial expressions in addition to the speech lines. The film's music is by Isobel Waller-Bridge (Flea Bag, War & Peace, Vita and Virginia, Vanity Fair), and David Schweitzer and uses many period songs with period choirs and instruments, including several songs from the English folk duet of Maddy Prior and June Tabor. Perfect for the movie by the way, with songs that really have soul.The cinematography is by Christopher Blauvelt (First Cow, I am Michael, Zodiac), another highlight of the film, using shots with good compositions, with lots of symmetry and contrast of character and elements in the shots, in addition to a clever use of the vibrant colors and pastels used at the time and the blue and green of the lawns of England of the early 19th century. Along with this, Alexandra Byrne's work as costume designer is excellent (Guardians of the Galaxy, Doctor Strange, Avengers, Phantom of the Opera, Murder at the Orient Express, Elizabeth: The Golden Age), studied and reproduced truthfully the clothes of that period, another strong point in the movie.Conclusion: the movie have a great production with emphasis on costumes, music and cinematography, along with good performances, and a good adaptation of the story, which perhaps isn't something thrilling to the audience on our current century standards, even being a work of such a celebrated author. The movie is very slow, and maybe a little too shallow and mundane (I dare to make an analogy with the TV series of the lives of those rich ""celebrities"" that we see today, but in another era). It would give a score of 6.5 to 7.0 / 10.0 for the movie, more to the side of 7.0 because of the beautiful production."
303,Well it is beautiful to look at and costumes are well done. The acting is good.. it's just lacking.. and the music is a little too dramatic. I just could not get pulled into.. it felt very false & pushed to have feeling.
304,It's yet another Emma ! The father daughter relationship is what is so important in this movie yet I didn't feel that love connection between the actors which is why I feel less drawn to it. Nonetheless still alright to watch through on a random day when you're out of stuff.
305,"Emma as a character is rather annoying so I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would. And romance in historical/period films works differently, doesn't it? How strange the way Emma and Mr Knightley's romance developed. I did like the cinematography and the colours in this movie though. Emma's father was also the funniest character even though he barely had any lines, I literally only laughed whenever he did something. The casting director did a great job casting Emma's father."
306,"The plot, like boiled water, has no high or low point at all, it is straight to the end, but the casting should be the best of all the versions, look at her little face. It's so nice to see her smile."
307,"Although this version of the plot is nothing new, witty and romantic. British pastoral scenery, the restoration of classical temperament makes the film look like a bright and colorful oil painting, visually very pleasing. Mr Knightley's casting is far from gwyneth's version of Jeremy north, both in appearance and temperament."
308,"Almost all the heroines of Jane Austen's novels have this nature, proud and kind and lovely. In real life Jane Austen was unmarried all her life, and in the movie novels her heroines all found their own happiness. This has to be said to be a fate. In this movie, Emma is keen to give people a red line as a matchmaker. She is very enthusiastic! But she also carries the arrogance of the upper class. She looked down on the working people at the bottom and made her friends miss the love that belonged to her. Emma was jealous of Jane's talent, but she also looked down on her nagging aunt. Finally Emma looked inside herself and found that it was all wrong because these people were very friendly to her.Birth is not everything that tests a person. Emma realized this. She went to say sorry to Jane's little aunt. She also went to make an effort for her friend's love. In the end, Emma also got her own happiness. This movie has many places to laugh, but also moved. But the picture is very beautiful, inside the hero's clothing is particularly beautiful. There is a sense of black humor."
309,"I wish i didnt knew that there is a remake of Emma what the hell they were thinking by making this film?!!! Emma one of my fav novel. they managed to make this version as bad as they can! ruined the main characters in every way..
there is enough movies and series about Emma dont need remake in the first place. why not remake pride? or wait if it will be like this one they better not to think about it"
310,"Who has read the wonderful Jane Austen's book could notice that as well... expecially Bill Nighly can't be Mr. Woodhouse... never in his whole life :-),
but also Mr. Knightley should be a lot more ""distinguished gentleman""... and Mrs Weston too, in this version she seems only another ""gossipwoman"".
Emma in the midst of all the mess that she combines has a sweet heart that I don't find here.
The most part of the main characters in this version are rendered worse than in 1996's one with the remarkable exception of Mia Goth>Harriet Smith... really delicious. And in this case it's the opposite: Toni Collette was in no way suitable for the role of the naive Harriet in the 1996's one.
The setting, the costumes and the interiors are wonderful and those save somehow the movie."
311,"'Emma' was a pure delight. a bright and well executed film that filled me with joy, sadness, fear and angst (which is what every movie should aim for!)
One of the things I loved about 'Emma' was how to me, it felt like a modern take on a classic era. this movie showed Emma's depth and her worth as a human. the character Emma, was portrayed as an incredibly likeable woman, much more than the book and Anya Taylor Joy played her astronomically well! We got to see Emma be confident, keep her morals and make mistakes. I loved her as a character and I loved the story. I don't think i have ever related to a character during a film more than Emma, and for that I am so grateful."
312,This was a pleasant and entertaining film which is well paced. A good soundtrack. Emma is not a character I particularly warm to but the film generates sympathy for her.
313,"Apart from not being the usual Emma we've been used to in previous TV and movie versions, Anya Taylor-Joy's Emma has a voice that is very hard to hear. I could clearly hear every word the other actors were saying but without subtitles I couldn't clearly understand a lot of what she was saying. It seems clarity of speach in modern productions are no longer a priority. Much like the well documented mumbling of Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley."
314,"I checked the imdb reviews before I went to see the movie, and kind of was expecting an allright movie but no. If I wouldn't have been so tired, I would have left in the middle of the movie. It was slow and nothing happened and the conversations in the movie was almost painfully boring. I wish I would have stayed home and not bithered actually getting up from bed to go watch this movie. Was a waste of time."
315,Ummm this was a bumbling comedic disgrace just like the recent/non recent pride and prejudice with the stupid Keira knightly
316,"Good story, good characters. But it took me sometime to figure out what Emma's purpose was in the movie."
317,"I am jealous of the next generation of students who will get to watch this in class. Faithfully takes the exact text of the book and breathes the humanity and passion whirling beneath the dazzling facade of the elite society that Autumn de Wilde and her talented cohort deliciously portray with mischief and delight.Every rewatch reveals a new layer.I can't help but be saddened by the decades of films we have missed out on through Autumn not being given the opportunity to direct earlier in her career, like Michel Gondry, with whom she shares that joint talent of visual flair with ability to coax amazing performances but I look forward to everything she does going forward."
318,"I know without looking lots of pro reviewers are going to compare this to candyfloss or a similar sugary but substance-less confectionery. Despite the shallowness it is mostly a good and competent adaption with authentic period details, but I feel Emma should have been more likable and clearly good hearted. I didn't really like Anya Taylor-Joy in the role. Maybe there some have been more Social Commentary or humour.I also don't know why they keep casting the same five or so actors with britface in period roles? Josh O'Connor was miles better here than he was in Les Miserables though.It all looks very beautiful and idealised... I wish the likes of Alice Sutton and Alexandra Byrne got as many accolades as the ""stars"" and directors, especially because they usually do a better job.Overall I don't think anyone really wanted another Emma adaption right now. Maybe a Clueless remake would have been better."
319,"Emma was a delightful movie based on Jane Austen's book. The main lady was dominating the film, being snobby and melding in everyone's affairs and especially her friend's. The performances were good and the costumes spot on. Emma's father was pretty funny too. The romance was nicely presented, although the male leads weren't that charming as to be alluring and to make Emma fall for them. But, overall, it was nice."
320,"The costumes were beautiful and the locations were very cleverly chosen but the acting left a lot to be desired and could have been much better.
The story of Emma is very light, frivolous even, apart from one or two serious moments. This was cold and disjointed and the ridiculous part where Knightley proposes compares to the version of Pride & Prejudice where Darcy jumps in the lake. I felt I could have loved these characters if they'd only been allowed to lighten up.
Jane Austen's Emma is perfectly written and when writers try to put their own mark on one of her stories, they invariably fail."
321,4/10 - this one was overwhelmingly dull and jus wasn't my cup of tea
322,"It's extremely over-acted which is very annoying, they've chosen an almost Versailles-like pastel palette, which doesn't match Jane Austen's 18th century gloomy, gothic England, also the movie drags and gets really boring after the second half, it could have been much shorter."
323,"I'm not sure what I expected, having never seen any previous adaptations or read the book but I found the acting pretty annoying and just not my speed."
324,Should have read these reviews before attempting to watch. Gave up after one hr. Beautiful costumes and settings but badly cast and a huge miss on the interpretation.
325,Turned it off 25 mins into the movie. I could not get into this movie.
326,"ANYA TAYLOR-JOY IS SO ATOMICALLY CUTE. 'Tis true her ravaging beauty draws no compare. Ripe with heavenly features, Anya's piercing, intense gaze holds me a capotr as her curly blonde locks and tall, slim body wholly inspire only the sweetest joys. Mia Goth too is lovely however Anya 'tis truly an icon. She's so really really hot. Anya's a true phenom, talented and tantalizing. I love EMMA. and Anya Taylor-Joy is 1 of my favorite young actresses. So distinctly beautiful, I love Anya Taylor-Joy! The original Gwyneth Paltrow version is probably better yet I like Anya so get her better movie roles."
327,"This has list all the charm of Emma and kept the least attractive aspects of all characters. Bill Nighy is great as Mr. Woodhouse but the rest are horrific, lack charm and it is a mystery why anyone would find anyone attractive to marry.
The two stars are for the gorgeous settings. Some comic elements are good bit this is the worst version of Emma. Shame on you. Badly done."
328,"Ok, I have never read Jane Austin's Emma and I had never watched any version of the novel except for Clueless which is loosely based on Austin's book. It's not that I don't read but the book never interested me at all. When I saw the trailer for this, the most recent version, I was interested in finally learning why there are soooooo many adaptations of this story. Let me tell you, I wasn't impressed.If I had never seen Clueless I would have a very hard time understanding the plot line. There are so many characters thrown at you during this 2 hour rom-com that I couldn't keep track of all the names. I felt like not one was fleshed out very well. I also had a hard time trying to see the attraction between Emma and Mr. Knightly for whom she ends up loving in the end. There were too many characters with similar names and styles that I never felt connected to any of them. The only reason I knew that Emma was in love with Mr. Knightly is because, again, I watched Clueless and I figured out that Knightly was the Paul Rudd character because they casually mention not being real brother and sister.I found the actress playing Emma didn't embody the energy that I would assume Austin gave her to show why we care about Emma. I really didn't empathize with her at all. Her looks are a bit sallow to show charm. I love Miranda Hart as Miss Bates but that was about it. The other actors were just playing it for genteel laughs. I like the idea of this story as it was written during a time when women were expected to fill a certain role and nothing more. If the character of Emma found herself in 2020, she probably wouldn't find it hard to find her way but I digress. The visuals were wonderful and I love the costuming though I felt some of Emma's clothing choices were a bit underwhelming for someone who is supposed to display wealth. Also the music choices are very odd. I felt like the director wanted a little Wes Anderson vibe but didn't hit the mark.So now I find myself wanting to do a deep dive and find a better version of this story as I am wondering why so many versions have been attempted. I'll start by rewatching Clueless then try to watch the Gwyneth Paltrow version but that may be as I really can't stomach her. Or maybe I'll just do the old fashioned method and read a book."
329,"I admittingly have never read or watched the story of Emma. I was thoroughly confused, bored and unable to grasp the point of the entire movie. I'm sure Jane Austin's writings are great, but sadly I'm not a fan of this.. new adaptation."
330,"Unfortunately the peripheral characters steal the show leaving the main act unable to win it back. Everything was there, a dashing Mr Knightly, a lovely best friend, beautiful costumes and glorious sets, but still somehow the delivery falls short.
I'd happily warm up with Mr Woodhouse, (quick, get the screen), window shop with Miss Bates, and even poor Mr Elton had my empathy; but Emma was brittle, a little self absorbed and far too cold.
I do wish they'd given her a little more warmth."
331,"2 hours of boredom. Most disappointing film of 2020. What kind of love story is this. The only thing i liked about the movie is the english accent,the costumes,and the scenery. Other than that boring film"
332,This is a comedy? Please. Beautiful to look at but hard to watch. A mostly terrible girl becomes a little less terrible. The end.
333,Awful soundtrack - very distracting. Tried to persevere through it but finally gave up.
334,"DREADFUL MOVIE. But the problem is with JANE AUSTEN, MORE THAN 200 YEARS OUT OF DATE AND NO LONGER POSSIBLE TO ENDURE.Once in my youth some 50 yeas ago I LOVED READING AUSTEN. I no longer can. The novel was relevant from late 18th century to late 20th century. IT NO LONGER IS OR CAN BE. And this kind of social novel is even more unable to talk to us today."
335,FAIL!!! Don't bother.Why is there a full stop at the end?
336,"PROS:
~Anya Taylor-Joy nails the role of the titular character and portrays a woman with a more dynamic style than the usual considering the specific period of time. She succeeds in being annnoying and charming at the same time and proves once again that she is one of the best actresses of her generation. Emma is an independent woman who considers every decision she takes is the right one. However, she soon realizes that her actions have a negative effect on the others. For instance, she manipulates Harriet Smith (Mia Goth) about her future and her beliefs and she offends Miss Bates with her comments (Miranda Hart).
~Mia Goth is excellent as Harriet Smith and you root for her character all the way through. Harriet is a woman who seeks hapinness in her life but depends too much on the beliefs of Emma until she finally realizes what's the best for her.
~The misinterpretations of the characters is one of the most strong aspects of the film especially the ones by Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton.
~The depiction of the high society is impressive. Examples of this are the way the servants behave towards Emma, the manners that rich people should demonstrate each other (with one comment they can easily be offended like Miss Bates) and the way they usually celebrate (the dance and the piano segments are fantastic). The dialogue of the film is witty and helps you understand the subtlety and the finesse these people should display. In addition, the film indicates that even between rich people there is a different valuation.
~Bill Nighy as the father of Emma is amusing and steals the show every time he appears on screen.
~From a technical point, the movie is impeccable. The production design is top-noch, the cinematography is beautiful and the costumes are excellent.
~The music score and the bright colors enhance perfectly the atmosphere of that era.CONS:
~The pacing of the movie is uneven at some points because some subplots aren't interesting enough. For example, the segment until the arrival of Mia Goth is a little boring.
~Josh O'Connor portrayal as Mr. Elton is cartoonish and doesn't fit in the tone of the film. Furthermore, the scenes with his wife are repetitive and the humor doesn't always land for that reason.
~The storyline about Frank Churchhill (Callum Turner) is underdeveloped. You never feel an erotic tension between him and Emma so the reveal about his secret marriage isn't something intriguing. Moreover, it would be better if the movie focuses more on the antagonism between Emma and Jane (Amber Anderson).
~The ending is predictable despite the chemistry between Emma and Mr. Kneightly (Johnny Flynn)."
337,"""Many eligible bachelors and maidens dwell in Emma's village, and under the impression that she is a born matchmaker after facilitating the knot-tying of her governess and the wealthy widower Mr. Weston (Whelan and Graves), her next goal is Harriet Smith (Goth), a young girl of obscure lineage, yet, Emma deems the tenant farmer Robert Martin (Swindells) is below Harriet's status (a classist prejudice that Emma is apparently oblivious to), in lieu, she tries to pair Harriet with the seemingly convivial local vicar Mr. Elton (O'Connor), to the obvious objection of George Knightley (Flynn), the brother of her brother-in-law, that the outcome leaves Harriet heartbroken and prompts Mr. Elton to a swift marriage with a girl hailed from elsewhere.""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks"
338,"Yet another of the myriad Jane Austen adaptations, which, I have to admit I enjoy. This version of Emma lives up to most Jane Austen renditions in that it is a gentle, sweet, soft kind of story that gives you a gentle, sweet feeling. In this flick we have what is a more mischievous Austen character than most in Emma, who, born into luxury and beauty spends her time judging others. Once she has judged them she decides what would fix their lives and tries to deliver."
339,I really wanted to love this. I was a big fan of the Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love) version. I love Clueless and I'm a big fan of Anya Taylor Joy (Split). And I did enjoy it I just feel like it didn't do much that gave it much of it's own personality. That being said there's a lot of fun here. Anya Taylor Joy is great in the lead and Bill Nighy is solid as her father. The other players don't command much attention and mostly its business as usual. The movie is colorful and the cinematography is bright and delicate. I just wish the movie didn't take itself as seriously because it could have used a winking eye.3.25/5
340,"I am a long way from the target demographic of this film; but I do love the tree main versions of Pride and Prejudice (BBC, Knightly and Zombies)This film is enjoyable enough but it feels a lot longer than it is.
The first third feels like nothing is going on, everyone is constantly in transit or getting dressed.When thing start to happen and romance and social faux pas hit the fan then I really got into this.All the performances were good and the characters interesting.
I am not a big Miranda fan but I really liked the part she played in this.The one element that everyone seems to agree with on here is the one thing I didn't like.
The filming is so bright!
Every scene feels like an advert for the Dulux Mardi Gras float.
My girlfriend assures me that everything in Victorian times was very colourful and vibrant.
What, even the grass?This was an enjoyable watch with a bit of romance, intrigue, dancing and marriage proposals at dawn.
But it felt a bit long and wafty.
Made a change but given the choice I would watch Pride and Prejudice over this."
341,"This adaptation of Jane Austen's classic is what I imagine a Wes Anderson adaptation of the novel would be. The colour palette, symmetrical shots, profile shots, and the relatively deadpan delivery by some of the characters all reminded of Anderson.Music was so present throughout the film that the soundtrack was like a narrator.Miranda Hart was an incredible Miss Bates. Overall, I loved the cast. Bill Nighy as Mr. Woodhouse also felt spot on. I was excited to see Tanya Reynolds as Mrs. Elton and Connor Swindells as Mr. Martin since I love both of them from Sex Education. Likewise, Rupert Graves was a wonderful Mr. Weston. I don't think I have seen her in anything else before, but Mia Goth was a great Harriet Smith; she was what I imagined the character to be while I was reading the novel.I thought Autumn de Wilde's Emma. was an admirable adaptation. I definitely preferred it to the 1996 version."
342,"Films that have an elegant feel and take place hundreds of years in the past usually don't draw me in. For that reason alone, take this review with a grain of salt. Based on the Jane Austin novel of the same name, of which I have never read, I went into this film blindly, as I haven't even seen the previous adaptations either. Although I will be admitting some great things about this film as a whole, I personally found it to be average overall. Here's why you'll probably love this movie if you're into these types of films, but also why it won't win you over if you're not.Emma. follows Emma Woodhouse (Anya Taylor-Joy) as she observes the ongoing relationships of her friends and family. Becoming too involved in certain areas, she begins to disrupt those relationships. In particular, she complicates things with her friend Harriet (Mia Goth) when she convinces her to make certain decisions. This made for a slightly frustrating experience for me, as I wasn't too fond of her actions. With that said, Anya Taylor-Joy as the titular character was fantastic, as she always is.Although I haven't seen tons of movies featuring Taylor-Joy in a meaty role like this, I have to admit that her being in a film does pique my interest. Her, along with the supporting cast of this movie, all do a great job in sucking you into this time period. I felt like I was transported back into the 1800s, which is no small feat. Movies like this simply don't work unless the production design is flawless and this film was pretty close to perfect in that regard. Being in the business as a production designer for over 25 years, Kave Quinn did some great work here.This brings me to whether or not you should watch the movie in general. Fans of stories from this time period that are prone to liking movies like this from time to time will probably love this film, because all the elements that these movies usually bore me with are extremely well done, admittedly. There is a flip side to that though. I've never been interested in movies like this unless they broke new ground and made a fresh new spin as The Favourite did in 2018. This movie was very well done though, so I definitely feel a positive grade is warranted.In the end, Emma. may not break any new ground for the genre, but it will more than please those who have been eager to see it. For anyone else, I fear it will either mildly entertain you or leave you bored. The 2-hour run time definitely felt its length for me and I didn't feel that the story went in many interesting directions. I've never exposed myself to this story in the past though, so perhaps this wasn't the best version to start with. Overall, it's a well-made period piece that just didn't interest me all that much."
343,Emma. is watchable just for how well the film is shot. The shots in the film are rich and we can experience that vintage England villages. Anya Taylor has done an incredible job as Emma and we can expect more good roles from her. The movie lags a little bit as the story is told slowly and less humour. But Autumn de Wilde has done a decent job telling this story.
344,"Beautifully filmed, decently acted, wonderful period sets and costuming. If it was supposed to be a comedy I don't remember laughing at anything. Other than that it's harmless entertainment."
345,It was a beautiful fun movie but it was kinda boring in the beginning and then it gets better and better
346,"EMMA is an early nineteenth century Jane Austen novel abouit a twenty one year old meddling busybody incorrectly assuming she understands and assists her neighbors. The plot is the reverse of most Austen plots centered pm a charming worthy if not noticed heroine finds general commuity acceptance at the end . Her EMMA plot has the heroine called to task near the end to finally repent and in doing so find community respect and happiness. Most two hour screenings of Austen plots have some better features and others not as good as the lot . I thinkk the characters not well portrayed in this version ad Knightly, John, and Isabella. Mrs. Bates. Mr. Elton, Mr. Woodhouse, Mr. and Mrs .Cole Harriet,. Mr. Martin and Jane Farfax seem the closest to Austen's intentions."
347,"Emma. Review:Emma. is based on Jane Austen's beloved comedy about finding your equal and earning your happy ending, is reimagined in this. Handsome, clever, and rich, Emma Woodhouse is a restless queen bee without rivals in her sleepy little town. In this glittering satire of social class and the pain of growing up, Emma must adventure through misguided matches and romantic missteps to find the love that has been there all along. I saw this almost two weeks ago so bear with me on this probably vague and short review. I really like Jane Austen, especially Sense and Sensibility, and the trailer looked like this would be a fun watch. I new nothing about the plot going in which is always a fun experience. I just expected a rom com sort of plot taking place in 19th century. Emma. was an enjoyable movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon. The movie had a fun little tone to it. I don't know how to describe it but it felt like a toned down Wed Anderson type of movie. That goes with some of the acting, set, costumes, and color pallets. I thought the acting was on point. Anya Taylor-Joy never seems to disappoint and played the uptight young lady well. She always gives her everything with her roles and I love it when I don't think much about it being her. I'm coming to see a story about Emma and I want to see Emma, not someone playing Emma. I haven't seen Mia Goth in a role for a while. The last time I believe she had a role was in last years A24 sci-fi drama High Life. I don't have a big issue with Mia Goth, however her voice can get annoying at points because she always seems to talk in the same way. This has been her least type-cast role and she does play a giddy, hopeless romantic girl and I think it's good to see her in another role. My other standout was Miranda Hart as Miss Bates. She always has a fun time with her roles. Hart has a typical type-cast role but I think she has a good time with it and makes it fun for the audience. The set is really beautiful to look at. Emma is obviously a rich woman and the mansion was just extravagant. I'm a sucker when it comes to mansions for sets because there's just so much you can do with them and it's rare to see one look bad. The colors used in the set and costumes were pastels and solid colors that complemented them well. That's what reminded me a lot of Wes Anderson films because the set and costumes always match very well. Also the score, composed by Isabel Waller-Bridge (Fleabag) and David Schweitzer, added you that feel. I like Isabel Waller-Bridge's score to Fleabag and this echoed some of the motifs from it. For example the operatic singing is throughout. It was just an animated score and had its own character that I liked. Mainly my issues reside in the plot. I thought the story was enjoyable, but not always the most interesting. I found myself getting a little bored at points with it getting slower and not caring too much about some characters. The climax, I don't even know if it was supposed to be the climax, didn't feel like a big issue to me. It was a problem that was easily resolved but they tried to make a bigger deal out of it. That's just me though. Emma. is an enjoyable movie, however it's one of those that I'll most likely forget about in the future. I would recommend seeing it though. Universal is releasing it on VOD this Friday along with some other films so if you're interested I would recommend it.My Grade: B"
