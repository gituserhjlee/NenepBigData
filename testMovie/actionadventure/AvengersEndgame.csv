0,"There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless. I haven't laughed (even cried) this much in Marvel movie or even in any movie. I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.Happiness, sadness, pure joy, excitement... I'm gonna miss this moment in my whole life because let's face it- it's been awhile movies can bring such a big enthusiasm like this.It is such an experience you'll gonna remember it forever. People are clapping, laughing, crying, full of a state emotion. It's 3 hours long but it went by like a finger snapping by Thanos, and now I'm thinking I'm actually in Quantum Realm because it felt like 5 seconds. Even though you know where the story is gonna bring you because it's still a 'superhero movie' but it left me speechless. It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.**SPOILER ALERT**Even some characters that you didn't like before, you will love them in this movie. Like Captain Marvel. I didn't like her before in her own movie but in Endgame they showed how powerful, how strong and how capable she really is. And now I kinda love her! But Marvel should really be careful of her line though, I didn't like some of her line like ""I'm the strongest"" and ""You didn't win because before you didn't have me"" duh. Also not gonna forget Hawkeye. To be honest, in Avengers I really didn't like Hawkeye because he's just a 'guy' with an arrow and just randomly showed up in any scene but actually he's character is so BADASS! Everything that we need, what we want is here.Also I don't get it why some people can not accept that Thor is fat or treat him like a joke. I mean, this movie might be trying to give us a message about no matter what 'shape' are you, you can be a hero and save the world. To be honest, I like what they did to Thor, that man is depressed and taking the most responsible after he missed the shot to kill Thanos in Infinity War. Even though he already did killed him but it's not gonna bring back his people of Asgard. Also he's God of Thunder for god sake, he could slap his stomach with thunder and got his abs back.I'm so happy too for Captain America. Finally he could do his dance with Peggy and I didn't expected that we could see the fight between Captain America with his own self. Also when Tony met his father really warm my heart, and we can see the 'real-life' Jarvis - I didn't expected that too.When the whole superhero arrived it is so EPIC! The whole person in theater are screaming and shocked. Gives me a goosebumps and still left me speechless!This movie is absolute perfection. The ending of this movie is we and the characters deserved. It gives a perfect balance for all these past 10 years. Epic and perfect ending, I was not disappointed at all. This movie was completely emotional and visually stunning. Now I get it why the Russo Brothers told us to do a Marvel Movie marathon before watching Endgame because this movie had everything to accomplish what left behind before all of this.Ready or not, whatever it takes.Go watch it for yourself."
1,"I have to say, my first reaction walking out of the cinema was that it was great. Probably an 8/10. You know there's so much fan service in this movie and I particularly loved the ""I can do this all day"" CA line from one CA to another. It was almost Toy Story 2, enlightened Buzz to naive Buzz banter.I loved Clever Hulk, found Thor hilarious, though a bit annoying at times, and loved the references to past movies. Cap swinging Mjollnir around was beautiful.The deaths in this movie were also pretty surprising but I agree with some of the more balanced reviews in here that it was bizarre that so much time was spent on Hawkeye - does anyone really care about him? Not really.Killing off Black Widow was a surprising touch, but I, like many others, probably felt more of an emotional reaction to Banner's relationship with her and not Hawkeye (because no one actually cares about him). Renner, as an actor, just doesn't cut it much, unfortunately.The real problem with End Game, is the time travel. I don't know why any movie franchise would ever want to deal with time travel knowing how much grief it creates. Sure they try to explain everything with their hilarious conversation about movies, but in the end, there are just too many questions left at the end of the day, particularly when they already try to explain it through the Ancient One.The most glaring one of these is, if they change the past, they're changing another timeline, so how selfish is that? If Tony Stark snaps his fingers and kills Thanos, what happens to that original timeline? If he sent Thanos and everyone back, how does he magically know not to send Gamora back who is now stuck in 2023 - and so does that mean 2014 Quill never meets Gamora?!? What the hell? Essentially erasing the entire 2014 GOTG franchise in that universe. If Captain America goes back in time, he will inevitably change history in some way or another, so that is another timeline, right? So while everyone else's timeline is meant to stay the same in the present (as said by Stark) how does Cap end up sitting by the same lake as everyone else.There are also way too many questions about new timelines created - but perhaps that is intentional, such as the Loki TV show. But this is why I hate it when they bring time travel into any movie and just add stuff to it to make it wrap up nicely in their own universe.Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.I also think Marvel made a serious mistake creating Captain Marvel, how is she brought in as a convenient deus ex machina and yet doesn't really stick around to show off all her abilities, and she can't even defeat Thanos single handedly? Pfft. That was rich. She can barely prevent Thanos from snapping his fingers, yet in Infinity War, Cap was able to actually hold off his hand too? Bizarre parallels.So okay, sure, it was enjoyable to watch, but I just feel that there are too many plot inconsistencies creeping into End Game. There should have been better ways to get the infinity stones back, and I think someone stupid just thought time travel was the best way to do it,."
2,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
3,So something else with your time. The movie is just that bad.
4,"It's just sad, that the best moment and best character drama was the bench that 'wasn't going to come back'."
5,"Oh my God! This movie is horrible... stupid story.
They ""stuffed"" all the superhero characters, but why? The story did not better because of it. Confused, silly movie. I hate it."
6,"Wow I couldn't imagine worse, how is this not rated somewhere like 3.7 or something, boring cgi fights"
7,I paid 10 euros for this movie... and it doesnt worth even for free view... disaster...
8,When you start including time travel it totally messes up the movie --- I mean there is no end it then.
9,"After Infinity War I was expecting Endgame to be the best movie made for all time, but it seemed like Infinity War was so great that the producers ran out of good material for Endgame. So instead of another decently awesome Marvel movie they went polar opposite to Infinity War and decided to make the worst movie possible. They chose to destroy the foundation of each of the main Avenger characters and prop up the secondary characters as the heroes in order to share the screen or be politically correct or something silly like that. And can we please stop making movies about time travel. It's stupid and impossible to do correctly and impossible in general so just ditch the idea! There's a lot more I could say but it's been almost a year now and I just don't care enough to keep tearing this movie apart. Basically I'm done watch Marvel because of this movie."
10,Mumbo jumbo happy ending jumping around horse crap. I could vomit from it. Even the music is crap. The only thing good in this movie is Thannos' voice. Also there was 2 good jokes. Well done. How much was this? ooo yeah.. a lot. I pity the people who loves this. It was horrible.
11,"This wasn't just bad as in disappointing, it was one of the worst films I've ever endured. I was enjoying it until 'time travel', and from then on it spiralled downwards until it hit rock bottom. Just terrible.
You know how Iron Man 3 was unwatchable? Well imagine that, but a hundred times worse and even longer.
It amazes me how someone, at some point, gave this the green light to be made and then wasted $350million on this disaster.
It's difficult to know where to start with this insufferable abomination, but I guess it must just be me as it made a ton of money at the box office and seems to get decent reviews.
If this is an indication of the standard of where the Avengers movies were heading, then good riddance. The proof in what I'm saying is the appallingly bad 'Spider-Man Far From Home', which is also one of the worst films I've ever had the misfortune to see.
I give it one star for the last 20 minutes where the series was wrapped up.
Disney, please don't inflict any more of this garbage on the world."
12,"The movie was made for only two things, the first eliminate all the old actors with a supposedly amazing end, that is just Fan service. And the other fact is that Marvel just wanted to make money however they could do something more impression.I have to admit that the special effects were fantastic and the movie was really funny to watch."
13,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
14,"If one Avengers production budget funded indie movies, we'd have hundreds of thousands of engaging, good indie films. Please stop making these films now. Just stop. We have the video game somewhere I'm sure, no need to keep on calling them movies. The problem with mass cinema goers is that they actually think this type of film is good. All candy and no cake. I can't watch another one."
15,"I can only agree with Martin Scorsese. This isn't cinema. It is worse than watching a documentary.
The whole saga was drawn out for so long, with just awkward feeling movies, and a pitiful ending.
If you think this movie is good, go watch a real movie, like The Godfather or Dark Knights trilogies. If you make more than 3 movies in a franchise, the quality will be just as bad, if not worse than the Fast and Furious series."
16,"All i want to say that. Take away 22 movies and a fanbase from endgame. It is nothing but a pile of dust. Endgame stands on the base of Marvel reputation. Alone, its trash. Silly and total cringe.
Thanks for making Thor a clown. Its just for memes"
17,"It's true what the scorsese said, this is just a children's playground. Most overrated movie of all time"
18,It really is a theme park ride. Iron Man movie series was decent but this is just trash.
19,"I'm not going to bother watching any more of these Marvel movies. Each one seems worse than the last, and there's way too much CGI. It's not like most of them are more than a 5/10 anyway, and that's being generous. I can't wait until one of them bombs at the box office, so that we can stop getting constant special effects demo tapes and watch some real movies. Death to cgi!"
20,"Complete garbage. The Marvel Universe is far too overrated and pathetic, there is nothing cool or funny in this silly universe"
21,The only relatable character dies? what the hell. I've never been so disappointed.
22,"Too many plot holes. Overhyped, overrated, too many fanboys with no brain"
23,Endgame is one of those movies that uses the hype and nostalgia of the old ones to give off an illusion that it's good when in reality its unoriginal CGI filled poorly written garbage
24,"Such a horrible movie. It never really held my attention, but I hung in there because it received great ratings. But then end I just had to say no more! The women have to come in at the end to do what then men can't?!? Every team member is struggling to complete the task, but when all seems lost, the amazing and awesome Capt Marvel finally jumps in and in one swoop knocks out this big bad ship causing the men so many problems. Then, she finds poor Peter Parker in the fetal position because he is such a useless and helpless man, only to have the ""ball"" picked up by all the women team members so that they can do what the men can't!! Get out of here with this trash! What a slap in the face."
25,"Unpopular opinion.
Let me start by saying that Endgame is not a bad film. In fact it was a decent film. But nothing more. Maybe I was expecting a masterpiece like Infinity War due to all this hype.
The first 2 hours of the movie are really boring. They try to build up many emotional moments only to destroy them with a joke the next minute. And there are really MANY jokes that feel out of place.
Endgame uses the previous marvel movies to give you a good story, without building it itself. It's like the writers didn't care to give us a proper story. They just filled it with many dramatic moments. Also, there was no action in the first 120 minutes.
Plus, I did not like the way they treated Thor at all. They made him a comic relief in the worst way possible. I wonder how Thor fans feel after watching this.
The last battle was epic and beautiful but that's all I really enjoyed. The cgi was top notch.
Also, the way they ended Cap's story, meh... Yeah we got it, you want to make people cry and give us the end of an era, but at least do it without creating dozens of plot holes.
The 3 hours went by fast, but I wouldn't watch it again in theaters (I had planned to watch it at least 1 more time).
This could be so damn good... Disappointed.*edit* Also, all of you fanboys who downvote all my reviews because you got angry because I gave your beloved Avengers a 6, you are just amusing and pathetic. Get a life."
26,"Quite simply, this is the most overrated film of all time. There was such a great hype about the film and it is rated a strong 8.5. My rating of 1 star is not right and I would give it a 3 or 4, but I feel it had to get 1 to try and level out this scandalous rating it has.Frankly the plot is unimaginative and poor and the logic used hapless. It just goes to show that they could produce any film, and as long as it has Iron Man and Co in it, then it will get a good rating."
27,Best to finish the MCU with infinity wars. This was garbage with massive plot holes and Thanos being a generic villain instead of the complex antagonist he was in infinity wars. Massive let down.
28,"The whole thing is just a disaster. The very premise, that Thanos thinks getting rid of half of the living things in the universe (not half the human or half the sentient beings, but half the cows & half the chickens & half the space creatures too) is just to dumb to handle. A five-year-old could tell you that's a stupid plan, and yet we're supposed to believe a Titan can't see the flaw in it? (I'd say the single bright spot here is Steve Rogers's backside. Truly, America's ass.)"
29,"So me and my roomie finally decided to watch endgame, and let me tell you our hopes were not high. at. all.We could´ve spent these 3 hours staring at each other and it would´ve been a better 3 hours."
30,It was so forgettable I forgot to write my review when I saw it in the theater....three hours and no fight scenes with the hulk....need I say more?
31,"As Avengers and Iron Man big fan, I'm writing this review, and I'm tryna watching this movie first time at home. Well, if in the cinema I was waiting something great, second time I'm knew there's nothing. Some sad scenes and dramatic tear-jerking, dear directors, are you serious? It's super hero movie not a drama come-on! Directors of this movie attempted to create Santa Barbara. Action scenes very poor like in low budget movies. There's no some great Iron Man's suit regeneration, or other new features. Just couple seconds of poor action with Tony Stark awaits you. If you need love line between Natasha and Archer, maybe it's worth watch it, otherwise no"
32,"This is the culmination of everything just plain bad. I'm used to these superhero movies going over the top and disregarding the laws of psychics, nature indeed the universe to be somewhat entertained however this movie sinks to a new low. Iron man now has a new suit that magically forms from nothing at the press of a button, the hulk has been reduced a comical shadow of his former self and thor is now some emotional drunkard with a beergut. I could forgive all that if the story made some sense and was at least remotly possible but seriously time travel!! That has to be the worst laziest unimaginative peice of writing possible. ""Question: why not just go back and kill thanos when he was an infant? Answer: it doesnt work like that."" Really that's your explanation!!! I'm sorry but that is just one of the many many holes in this movie not to mention past Nebular travelling to the future and ends up getting killed by future Nebular. How can she be alive to kill her past self???????? IT CANT HAPPEN!!!!! so in summary this whole movie is totally ridiculous, impossible and an insult to any half way intelligent human being. I know it's just a movie, however these paradoxes are just to big to ignore to get any enjoyment from this debacle."
33,It was a garbage with lots of plothole. Waste of time and waste of electricity
34,"I personally have not been a fan of the avengers since the russo brothers took over. The acting in this film was like watching a middle school play. No emotion from anyone except jeremy renner and rdj. Way too long and the plot was just stupid, i think this goes to show huge budget definitely doesn't make a amazing movie."
35,This is a replica of guardian of galaxy. Too boring to watch.
36,I can't understand why ppl like this over-achting superhero garbage time after time... It is no cinema at all. Almost every storyline is the same. Marvel milking movies these days.
37,"One of the top boring superhero films!
3hrs of runtime makes no sense w/ all drama & the action part being not more than 30min....
Not worthy to watch again!"
38,"3hrs of zooming around jumping through time, with stops for flat emotional diatribes . Then an end battle where the actors who are retiring were given a story exit. Blah blah. At least 'infinity war' had more laughs and a few nerdgasm scenes like Thor arriving in wakanda. End game looks and feels like a money extraction excercise . Perhaps they should have made this into a trilogy with part one thanos winning (2hrs), part 2 all about the emotional distress and how messed up things are (2hrs), then part 3 how they sort stuff out (2hrs). A bit like the first star wars trilogy . Overall meh"
39,"I've just come from watching Endgame and I must say that I am disappointed.I loved Civil War and I loved Infinity War. When I came out of those films, I knew immediately that they were great and that I wanted to see them again. With Endgame, I'm not sure.I respect how they were prepared to show the consequences of what Thanos had done but by killing him off so quickly and then them having to do their own stone quest (hadn't we already seen Thanos doing this in IW) it felt slow and lazy. Worse still was that it felt very self-indulgent and attempting to be clever for clever sake.Like how Back to the Future II considered itself clever for showing the events of the first film but with Marty flitting around behind the scenes to ensure that it all still happened. I know it's meant to be fan pleasing but it really felt like a gimmick and lacking in confidence. Almost like it was saying 'Hey guys, this will make you smile'. If you want to make me smile, concentrate on maintaining the quality of your product rather than directly trying to make me like you.But the trouble with messing around with timelines and bouncing around is that it makes the audience start asking questions during the film. The linearity that we'd seen in IW and the imminent fast approaching threat is replaced in Endgame with a lack of direction and characters that are earlier versions of who the audience have seen.In IW we were shown Thanos. He was written to be sympathetic or at least a character that we the audience could understand. He believed in what he was doing and this made him more rounded. But in Endgame, that version is dispatched quickly and we are supplied with a 2014 (?) Thanos who isn't the character we know but is just a token bad guy.This Thanos hasn't made the sacrifice at Vormire, he isn't the guy that would empathise with Scarlet Witch for what she did to Vision. He has suddenly become a token cut out evil bad guy that needs to be defeated. Hell, the writers even manage to forget their own time loop by saying that this Thanos has learnt that he doesn't want to wipe out 50% anymore because they are too ungrateful. How does he know this when the 2014 Thanos has only just literally arrived in the post wipeout Universe? How has he had time to form the opinion that his previous quest for a 50% cull isn't worthy?Is this a case of the writers being terrified that they had created a bad guy that people related to or was it a fear that they'd written themselves into a hole? Why go to the effort of creating that character in IW to suddenly kill him off at the beginning of Endgame just for a dramatic punch?For me, the time travelling and stone gathering wasted time to create unimportant scenes that fundamentally undermine the films that came before.
In my opinion it would have been better if they had shown the remaining Avengers preparing to do some Avenging and maintained the single minded linearity of IW of battling towards and reaching a post click Thanos and somehow reversing his work.The more I think of the film, the more plot holes and frustrations manifest themselves. Thor's drinking and man child antics might have been initially funny but one begins to realise that they are deliberately doing this to clip his wings. Likewise with Hulk, his primordial desire to smash and destroy has been removed to think it out and he has become an embarrassing shadow of his former self.The thing that is meant to be amazing about the MCU is the world building but inconsistencies have been appearing and there are so many in Endgame that it makes you question whether these two films are written by the same people.In IW, Thanos is a dangerous and credible threat because he has the infinity stones. He takes on half of the Avengers, Strange and some of the Guardians on Titan and smashes them and then takes on the other half on Wakanda and smashes them. Yet it is Stormbreaker (whose creation we have seen been hard earned by a motivated Thor) that has the power to take down Thanos even when he has a full complement of Infinity Stones.Yet we roll forward to Endgame and we have literally all the good guys together in one place, Cap with his shield, Tony fully powered up, Scarlet Witch p*ssed and vengeful, Capt Marvel who can seemingly do anything and Thor wielding both Mjolnir AND Stormbreaker and Thanos NOT in possession of the gauntlet, yet they can't defeat him.It's like the fights in IW were so amazing because the good guys were taking on an unbeatable foe yet here he is now seemingly defeatable by the 'rules' that the writers established . A good example of this would be in IW when Cap is the last man standing before Scarlet Witch and he grabs the gauntlet. You see the look of admiration/respect on Thanos' face that Cap is holding open the gauntlet before he punches him to the ground yet now that scene seems pointless.The writers for Endgame seem to have been driven to undo everything they did in IW. All the tension, all the sacrifice, all the development of Thanos discarded for well, I don't know what. It makes no sense.IW had two incredible scenes that used to choke me up. When Cap appears in the train station, the Avengers theme kicks in and Falcon and Widow take down the henchman in a wonderfully choreographed scene. In just that one scene it shows them coming to the rescue, it shows how intuitively they work together and it showcases their heroism.Likewise when Thor creates Stormbreaker and makes his entrance on Wakanda, I felt it for the journey that Thor has been on. He's had to contend with loss and defeat and humiliation and this is his redemption. Here is a character that has earned his game changing weapon and when he arrives and demands to face a character that everyone else is running away from, I want to punch the air.But in Endgame, that feels like it has to be corrupted. We can't have Thor being dominant, let's break him and make him a fool. We can't have Thanos being complicated and relatable, let's make him a cut out bad guy. We can't have Hulk being rage fuelled and smashing stuff up, let's make him more sensitive and talking stuff out. We can't have Cap being stoic and heroic, let's have him ridiculing one of his own iconic lines in a silly gimmicky fight with himself and commenting on his butt. We can't have a powerful female character that we're invested in look sexy AND be able to take down Thanos, let's give Scarlet Witch a small part but focus our attention on a female character that hasn't earnt our admiration or desire for revenge.To be honest, the 'rules of engagement' had been set so well in IW that when in Endgame Thanos massed his ranks against the Avengers and then ALL of the good guys showed up, I was almost expecting the camera to pull away and not show the fight given that it was so obviously going to be an easy win for the good guys.And as for the big fight scene, it did reek of what DC always manage to do which is just throw everything into an end battle and bludgeon you with CGI and pyrotechnics so that you aren't really sure what is going on.In the many fights in IW, you knew what was going on, you recognised the combatants, you understood the stakes and you identified the geography of the scene. In Endgame we got one big massive fight where everything was thrown in the pot and it was just assumed by the directors that we would be happy with all the flashing lights.
And I have to say that considering that Steve and Tony fell out so hard, and that Tony's criticism of Steve was so unfair, that I really had hoped for more than just a handshake, a muttering of 'no worries' and 'here's your shield'. These guys wrote and directed Civil War, they created the line 'we fell out hard' and hence I had hoped for something deeper and more touching than a handshake.Steve wrote Tony a letter telling him that when he needed him he'd be there but once again the Iron Man bias had to creep in and once again Tony was the victim and the ultimate hero.But I think my biggest problem is how the convenient time travelling undermines everything. When a franchise starts retrofitting stuff (like Fury's eye being from a space cat), it's then hard to consider the previous stories.Having 2014 Gamorra means that all the evolution that we saw her go through in GOTG 1 and 2 is wasted. Having Cap marry Peggy means the pain of his sacrifice, him seeing her in Winter Soldier when she is suffering from Alzheimer's, hell even his blossoming relationship with Sharon Carter is kinda irrelevant. Having seen Thor at last step away from his two weaker origin films into the entertainment of Ragnarok and the redemption in IW leaves us now with a bumbling buffoon.We know that what makes Captain America what he is, is the serum that makes him a super soldier. That he was transformed from a weakling to a superhuman. Sam Wilson is not a super soldier and he didn't take the serum. He is Falcon. Now maybe in the comics he becomes Cap but Bucky is a super soldier. Is the new Cap going to foil an evil plot and be defeated with a tazer or a knife to the chest? Consider the beatings that Steve has taken and the physical strength that he has shown we can recognise that Sam Wilson does not have that.I'm sorry to say but the Russo's have dropped the ball. Themselves and their writers have succumbed to their success and their desire to be engineers of political correctness and social change. I thought Endgame would be the high soaring end to this 10 year run of impressive movie entertainment but in the end the writers got carried away, the directors over reached and the studio sacrificed the integrity of their product for a chance to 'educate' us all. A real shame and a wasted opportunity.Infinity War is clearly the highlight of the last 10 years but even now I fear that repeated viewings will render it pointless considering how the makers decided to fundamentally damage it."
40,"The simple fact of the matter is, you f#cked this up! Everyone loves a plot twist, not a kaleidoscope of ridiculous smashed together story plots that have no direction. You sold us a lemon and from the looks of it, you dont even feel bad about it. Point in question. Captain Marvel is looking after thousands of other planets....... is Thanos on those planets???? No. Hawkeye has a hair cut half way though the movie and then grows it back in the next scene. Why isnt Gamora in the end shots? How did none of the Avengers notice and old man sat on the bench before Steve Rodgers went back in time? Pepper Potts could turn her body into malten liquid but now she seems to have forgotten that little life slip up and so has gone for a suit that looks suspectly like the Wasps. Thanos held Thors bloody axe!!! Is he worthy?? This film surely isnt"
41,This movie was a terrible mess from start to finish.
42,I know there are a lot of hardcore Marvel fans out there but it baffles my brain that this movie gets the praise that it gets. Infinity War was a decent movie but Endgame is pretty bad. Iron Man and Spiderman were great. The Dr. Strange reveal where you realize this is the exact thing he predicted as the only successful way to defeat Thanos was actually pretty darn good. What throws it off is the Disney political correctness. What the actual f*$k was that girl power scene towards the end? It made me so unbelievably un-immersed it is insane. I don't truly believe this is a 1/10 but imma give it a 1/10.
43,Man what a let down after Infinity War. Virtually no action in a superhero movie. Predictable plot with lame time warping around all over the place. And what in God's name did you do with Thor's character after the last movie holy crap! So glad I didn't waste my time in a theater for this one.
44,"3 hours of boredom, pain, suffering and cheap fan service. One of the most overrated movies."
45,"I did not care for a single second of what was really happening. Too much emphasis on certain characters while others are left in just to make it seem more ""epic"". Hulk was the only character of any entertainment value. I was more entertained by the audiences reaction to certain scenes than the actual film. The scene where Black Widow dies, the girl behind me whispered to her friend: ""Is she dead?"" Like no s*** you just saw her fall of a cliff and slam on the ground.Besides the 30 minute battle, how they handled Tony Stark's death was well done, especially the funeral. If they ended on that long shot showing all the characters, then I would of liked it a little more, but it just kept going.It bored me to death. I only saw it because on how it was considered a ""cinematic event"" to most. To the lovers of film, I really don't recommend it. Just wait for the final battle to be put up on YouTube or something and watch that."
46,"A CGI mess...Ao many plot holes,terrible jokes and overall stupid movie made for its 12 year old audience"
47,"Painful, crass, belligerent. I went to see it on a whim and walked out of the cinema after 15 minutes."
48,"You can't even consider this a film. It's a 3 hour tv episode. Films should work on their own. Even batman returns and the dark knight understood this, and work on their own. This ""film"" is okay enough. The ""original"" score is terrible. The acting is decent. The CGI is way overused, not a single shot without some CG ""enhancements"". The story is, well, near nonexistent once you take out the action sequences. I'd give this a 5/10. Only rated it 1 star because a franchise film does not deserve a spot in the top 100."
49,"I do not like marvel films, because forced comedy is not how you make films.
I liked infinity war because of thanks, a very decent villian.
When comes to endgame, it is a fraud, emotions without reasons and are they not the avengers, they avenge. Right!
I saw the trailer and thought this is gonna be a film where avengers are gonna shine. But all that suit up, training was for time travel to see their younger selves and parents.
An 8 year old will be able to write that outline.
By far the biggest disappointment by marvel, it has turned itself into the new transformers franchise. The only thing they are better at apart from the money is, paying off critics and websites to mislead by positive reviews."
50,"There are many reasons why this movie sucked.... Im a guy who liked Infinity war 1 and had expecations fo the second movie.
Everxthing in this movie was fine except one little detail... the story. And without a good story a movie is worthless....Lets rescue antman by a rat which is just runnig over buttons randomly...
The writters put a lot of Work inside this Idea for sure.Oh and bad character development.I enjoyed it that it wasnt about good vs evil in the first movie. It was kinda good vs guy who think he is doing the right thing...
They just throw that thing away.... In the end Thanos Just want to erase everyone... And why? Just because of dient work out the First time to erase half of the existence...
I mean it shouldnt have ended with his success. But Just changing his motive and making him a simple bad guy Shows how uncreative writers had been."
51,"I can't believe this movie got a so hight raring. Even hours of this trash can't compete with 15 minutes of other masterpieces that sadly no one talks about. The average audience, who wouldn't even distinguish wes Anderson from Tarantino, cares to write unwarranted reviews, and the fact that the most famous platform in the world (and the last word on the success of a movie or not) allows it, in my opinion, It's an affront to the art of cinema."
52,"Where was The Living Tribunal? What A Disaster Movie.Endgame is the highest grossing film ever worldwide and the 5th highest worldwide when adjusted for inflation. But it was complete Garbage. It is not part of the 23 MOVIES anymore.After a year of waiting since that Epic Piece that was Infinity War, this is the Endgame that Dr. Strange was on about? What A Disaster, It was a complete shambles. They had perfect vision when they made Infinity War but it is like they lost the Power when making this silly borefest.Problems with this movie:° Where was The Living Tribunal? The Being was ment to Bring the Characters Back and Judge Thanos. Not this Time Travel Garbage.° What happened to Captain Marvel? A whole origin movie for her, for the build up to this and that's what they produce? Is this a Joke?° How can you destroy the Infinity Stones when each of them contain an Element of Existence itself?° How Can You Put the Soul Stone back?° How can Gamora come back from the dead but Black Widow Can't?° Why is Hulk a Big Joke? Isn't he the Strongest?° This Thanos doesn't know any of the people he is fighting.° The Time Travel fix everything nonsense, do they not get it? It is just too easy and boring.° The movie is way too long and boring.° Thor was a complete Joke° No Epic Battle between Hulk and Thanos that EVERYONE was waiting for.° No Proper battle between Captain Marvel and Thanos that was built up to happen.° The Final battle was LacklustreThe Highlights were:° Great Quotes from Thanos° Captains America vs Thanos was Great° The 'I Am Inevitable' Snap from Thanos was Really GreatThis Movie was terrible, what the hell were they thinking?The Endgame should have started out by Thanos Seeking to Make another Infinity Gauntlet for the purpose of defence, then using the Reality and Time Stones to recover his army. Begin Fortifying his Defenses on a different Planet with his army defending him and getting ready for the Avengers final assault on him now that they have recruited Captain Marvel.The Living Tribunal Should of Judged Thanos and Brought the Characters back in this Movie.OH Boy, they blew it. What a missed Opportunity. 😒"
53,"Burn you Scorsese Blurays for another marvellian mass production... ummm... product is here! Let's get some CGI going, so happy we do not understand even the basics of the human psyche. Let's make sure no-one does! Let us judge everyone for we are truly better. Let's keep that PC flag flying high. Let's not see anything that it real, let's polish the world. We all hate real movies. Alpa Chino truly stands for Booty Sweat. Thank you so much!"
54,"The most hyped up soap drama of all time. lots of nothingness and pointless battle
Thanos just sucked in this movie"
55,"I would have been happy if ""Infinity War"" had been the last installment. Let viewers decide if Thanos was right or wrong. Give us some credit. It may be a comic book franchise, but it was a semi-smart one. Was. Too long, too light on plot, and not engaging at all. 3 hours of my life I'm not getting back..."
56,"There are so many flaws to this film that I hardly know where to begin, and they all spawn in the writers' and directors' lack of cohesive storytelling ability. They do not understand the back stories to each character, they are unable to write love stories, and they try to pander to too many crowds at once.My main beef is Steve's ending. He would never act the way he did, ever.In Captain America: Winter Soldier, Steve's conversation with Peggy depicts him realising that she has lived a full life (with her husband and children), and she encourages him to live his. In the TV series Agent Carter, Peggy develops a relationship with Daniel Sousa, her husband-to-be. They tried so hard to push the Steve and Peggy romance, with a picture of Steve on Peggy's desk at SHIELD HQ, but where were the photos of her family? Why was the desk otherwise completely blank?? Feeble, too little, and too late.Steve knew Peggy married Daniel, so why would the writers and directors think it a good idea to turn Steve into a time travelling homewrecker? That's disgusting enough in itself, but when you add the fact that the directors also stated in an interview after Endgame's release, that Steve would save his frozen self and then his two selves would ""take turns"" with Peggy (while knowingly abandoning Bucky to the torture of Hydra), and you have a new definition of ""tasteless"".But let's say you're OK with Steve acting completely out of character, the time travelling still doesn't make sense. In the film, Bruce explains that changes made in the past does not affect the present, but instead creates an alternate timeline. They make a big deal of explaining it, ridiculing Back to the Future in the progress, so why is it that Steve shows up as an old man on the bench at the end? If he chose to remain in the past, according to Bruce's explanation he should not have shown up in the ppreset, but in an alternate timeline. The only way he could've shown up in the original timeline is if he used time travel, which he did not (or he'd be standing on the platform).It's such a gigantic plot hole, I can't believe people don't realise it. Horrible film, 0/10.
Final note: to the people who support the film and say Steve ""deserved a good ending"", what about Peggy and her family? Did they deserve to be wiped out? Steve had no right to erase those children from existence."
57,"The strongest hero is kept out of the story and did not even explore her powers here..
""Iron man Endgame"""
58,"Long and boring time travel movie
which makes no sense at all"
59,"Unless you can sit down your brain, or you have a shut brain already, there is no way you can pass the main twist when they get to go back in time using (insert nonsense wrong science sounding terms here). Why does it matter? because everything becomes predictable (spoiler alert, there is nothing to spoil)
Why stop there then? just go back in time and fix everything else. Martin Scorsese is right, this is not cinema."
60,It lacked many of the major events that we were wanting for
61,"The first part of the movie is a sitcom, talking and dad's jokes. It almost(!) catches up with ""Friends"". If only movie was released in 1999...
The second part is even worse, It reassembles ""Back to the future"" but it definitely does not catch up even to 1989.
And there is this third part. Explosion of... left-wing ideology. You will instantly get a T-CD4 lymphocytes drop and vomit with rainbows. It ends with: SPOILER ALERT Capitan America being now black.
The CGI is great, I enjoyed it very much. But the best part of the movie was a trailer before. There is still hope in this modern world. ""Bad Boys"" are still black and still as brilliant as in 2009. I'm looking forward to watching them again."
62,"This film is all about CGI effects and animation.
0% mind blowing.
80% nonsense science
20% jokes"
63,So much advertising for a movie.. I saw the avengers faces everywhere ..even on cola's cans at the supermarket... Was it worth it? Nope. It was boring.
64,Coulda been done 1m better in an hour or so - too much crap on the hot dog to get a decent bite
65,"It's horrible , it's terrible , it's CRINGE , there's no time for a story. They literally introduce a new character every 38 seconds. Torture"
66,Too many plot holes and scenarios that don't line up with what was put in place in the previous MCU movies. Massive let down for the entire story arc. Best to have the MCU movies end with Infinity Wars.
67,"This movie is better than joker.
Hm..
Totally suckss.
Couldn't understand a single thing."
68,"Nonetheless, america has loss..... No Animation or CGI can safe america. Hail Stanley"
69,"My 10 year old nephew LOVES super heroes and he's watched all Marvel and DC movies, but after 30+ minutes into this one he says: ""This movie is no good. We are wasting our time"".I couldn't agree more. We forced ourselves to continue watching though, maybe it would get better. It didn't. At times we both laughed at how bad it was.The 10 year old who (again) LOVES super hero movies suddenly stopped watching while there was still 40 minutes left, he just went out to play instead. At this point I couldn't care less of how things turned out at the end so I just turned it off prematurely.Just an indication of how failed this movie was, in our opinion."
70,"Just watched this in fast-forward.
i simply cannot digest this universe where in one hand high tech space travel magic creatures are living along with dump low tech planetlings , so i guess that the majority of the fans are identifying them self to those lowlifes. and the most irritating for me is how low modern they dress them self in this marvel universe."
71,Yeah it was good but it prequels were better. People just see this as good movie because their fav heros dies in this film but dude it wont make any sence . Making fav hero dies wont let it good movie it must have some meaning in it .
72,"One of the most overrated and overhyped movies of 2019, filed with plot holes, subpar acting, simplistic drama, tensionless fight scenes and a ton of CGI explosions."
73,"The last Avengers ended with a philosophically valid dilemma. Stop the overpopulation of all worlds by halving the population in the universe in order to save humans and other species. The only mention of environment in Endgame was Captain America stating ""a pod of whales was seen in the Hudson, if you want to look at the bright side"" to which Black Widow replies ""I will throw this sandwich at you"". Yup, that's as deep as that conversation went. Immediately they were back to the tired old 'save humanity from evil Thanos' plot. The world is portrayed as a complete shambles with Thanos' reduced population measures. It would have been far more interesting to show the positive changes of having fewer people in the richness of the planet, thriving of other species as well as our own. But no, that is completely ignored and the ecosystem crushing population returns. Very generic plot, disappointing."
74,If u kill your past self how the bloody hell u exists in present 😹
75,"So predictable. There is nothing is this movie that explains people liking it. Just horrible, waste of time."
76,"For a while, the hype for this movie was built up because it was intended to be the culmination of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe films. However, taking a look at it now, all I see is that they were lazy with the writing and went with the most predictable storyline possible and used time travel as an excuse to replay their greatest hits. It didn't feel like an original story whatsoever. There are great movies being made with actual heart and soul and I am deeply saddened to say that Avengers: Endgame is not one of them. It lacks originality and whatever originality there is is simply the writers pandering to the fans (eg. Captain America being able to lift Mjolnir). The entire movie also felt as if they expected the audience to have seen every single Marvel movie before it. What of those who haven't? I seriously don't understand how this movie became the highest-grossing film of all time. And now they are campaigning for it to get an Oscar?!!!!! I have to be honest when I say that it does not have my vote. I grew up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe and these characters meant so much to me and a lot of people. They brought people together and this movie only makes them look like a joke. Especially Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, and Hulk. The Russos thought they were being funny by making Thor into Santa Claus. Well, if they were going in that direction, they might as well have sent him to the North Pole and have him use the Bifrost to send presents to kids every Christmas!!! More efficient than using a sleigh with 9 reindeers!!! No elves needed (proven in Thor: The Dark World which they keep trying to remind us happened). As for the Hulk, he was even more useless in this film than in the previous film! I don't know what they were thinking. When did Shrek get a PHD in physics??? And Thanos at the beginning was just a rip-off of Two-Face from The Dark Knight, a movie that, need I remind you, DID win an Oscar. Might as well have Nebula walk casually out in a nurse costume as the Avengers facility was blown to kingdom come. And don't even get me started on Black Widow's death!!!! They basically just rehashed Gamora's death from Infinity War. Like, did they even get Ross Marquand to come back as Red Skull or did they just use archived footage. Black Widow was a character we as Marvel fans grew to love and relate to because she was damaged, she had demons. She as a character that we as fans who have our own struggles could relate to. And she deserved a better death than that. She didn't even get a proper funeral!!!! That just makes me so mad 😡 !!!! And then Iron Man, The Godfather of the MCU!!! They shouldn't have done that to RDJ. In the film, he starts out in space like he did in the first trailer for the film and then in the actual film, it's only true that he will die in space for, like, two minutes. That is, until, surprise, surprise, Captain Social Justice Warrior comes to the rescue! I mean, she can fly through space and shoot plasma beams but she can't even hold out on her own against Thanos without his mirror-image kitchen knife!!! Even Wanda Maximoff gave him a literal run for his money and when she lifted up Thanos, she didn't look like she was struggling at all, she was all ""please keep all arms and legs straight and enjoy the ride cause you gonna die for killing my Red Tornado rip-off boyfriend."" That final battle has its cringeworthy moments: like that all-star ladies team-up but I've seen grannies walking into a book club meeting look more intimidating than them. I mean, what the hell was Mantis there for? Was she gonna be their cheerleader? If so, where were her pom poms (Ohhhhhh, the actress's name is Pom...Klementeiff. And was that supposed to be funny, Kevin?). Then there was the funeral scene, with everyone acting like the president had died or something. I mean, I bet you Drax didn't even remember who it was that died to begin with and was probably asking himself why everyone was so sad while Aunt May was getting Happy's number (probably when they started dating). And Nick Fury saw the funeral and he was all ""well, I'm done with this planet. I'm gonna ask Carol about that new hairdo cause it's not doing her any favors"" while Carol was all ""I rescued him from space for this?!!"" Nebula was probably even wondering who to play paper soccer with and Wanda was probably wondering whether or not she had to stay in her room. Then you have the Old Man Rogers debacle with Bucky and Sam all like ""oh, yeah, you invented time travel, that's cool, we're just gonna pretend like that's normal and all"" and Bucky thinking ""well, looks like I'm the sidekick now"". Plus, what about all the stuff about the Infinity Stones and branched timelines that the Ancient One was babbling on about. Did everything she said suddenly not matter because it was Captain America? It feels like they only brought in familiar faces because they thought it would look cool in the final battle. The way this movie went down, you would think that the final battle was the ONLY thing that the Russos directed. And the way they opened the film was just so random you didn't know if it was just another sneak peek or not, I mean, of all Avengers, why start with HAWKEYE?!!! I get that they wanted to show the scope of the impact that Thanos had with his Snap but to start with HAWKEYE?!!! They should have left that scene in Infinity War and opened the movie with Carol arriving on Earth or something. There is so much to point out about this movie that it is just exhausting. It feels like another attempt by Hollywood and Disney to make a cash grab and let everyone know that Big Brother (Mickey) is watching and controls all. Not too difficult to imagine an army of Mickey Mouses marching and saluting dear leader (Bob Iger)."
77,"After infinity war which IMO is the best of all the avenger movies, I was really looking forward to the conclusion.Well, what a disappointment. The story made no sense at all. There was no character progression with Thor almost non existence! How can this be with him being the almighty god of thunder commanding the bi-frost in infinity war?!That pace or the movie was slow and boring, the acting lethargic with a real lack of fun.I found myself forwarding large chunks of this movie just to get to something good!The ending was a total shambles and pathetic! Total Hollywood cheese which really didn't work.They will no doubt make another Captain America movie so why end it like that? Passing the title of CA to someone else when they don't even have superpowers?!!The more I think about it the worse it is.Just a money making ending with no thought or direction.Should have left it with infinity war."
78,"Soulless junk. The first act promised a serious take on the nature of revenge but the movie quickly gave up on interesting thematic and became a senseless mess.I didn't care for a single character, the action was a confusing mess and the new characters do not give me much hope in the future of these Marvel films. On the plus side, this may mean diminishing returns on future instalments in this ""cinematic universe"" which would be great news for original films that aren't getting screened theatrically from the many megaplex screens being eaten up by this cynical capitalist trash. But hey... maybe the kids like it?"
79,"The first part of this film is painful to watch, as there's very little dialogue. The plot isn't much good either. I don't see why people loved it so much. And it's way too long."
80,Infinity War was a million times better than this trash
81,"How can we take insignificant uninteresting stuff and make it awesome stuff because this flick has loads of characters and you may or may not like the premise of the jeweled glove and having to stop Thanos' destruction. Do you like that premise? To make awesome from awesome is something but un awesome into awesome something else to do. First the bad is it has too much melodrama with faces filling the screen in different emotive expressions to bring more ""important"" to everything. It's like the Looney Tunes episode of opera singing with Bugs, Elmer Fudd, wearing helmets with little wings, and a fat white horse, the type that of helmet that Thor wears too. Never into this episode because I like FUN. Or like the symbol of acting, the frowning face and the smiling face so I get there's an audience for this that I'm not for. The other thing is referencing other movies in here. Some of the references people might not even like, numerous time traveling flicks mentioned, Hot Tub Time Machine, Terminator, BTTFuture, Time Cop, Bill and Ted, even in Cap: Civil War I recall Empire Strikes Back which I thought the same thing but didn't think there would be way more in this movie by the makers, as some may not even like some of those movies. This isn't a tv show, but a movie, it sounds like something people you're around would say, not actual characters in the movie. Thirdly there's too much sentimental domestic stuff rearing itself with too much ""family"" shyt , little kid crap, YAWN. This was a problem in Captain Marvel in the mid part in some shack remeeting an over emoting lady friend and her tyke, I was expecting Cap Marvel to present some tampons to her to ease her, or even the Skrulls wearing sweaters to make it cuter. These are space warriors in the comics, for Pete sakes. This is off the top of my head. In Endgame what I'm talking about is perfectly shown in one scene out of nowhere this happens: this guy is sitting on a front porch (I get he's from Iron Man but others may not have seen that) and his tyke says she wants cheeseburgers. ""You can have all the cheeseburgers you want, cheeseburgers, all of them,"" paraphrased, while spacing out having a sedated appearance, and this just cuts to another different scene. What the?!?!?? Geezers sitting on front porches, thanks movie. This encapsulates why this domesticated crap is crap.Now the good stuff is this is funny af (af acronym was actually on some billboard recently kid you not) moments from Thor, a delightful chap, who's taken the spotlight a lot recently after being in the shadow in the early MCU, the opening scenes from Guardians is reshown from a diff perspective of like Starlord doing the same walkman listening and miming motions while the current superheroes spying on him hilariously. The revisiting of other Marvel movie scenes kind of work like from Thor: Dark World, Avengers 1, Cap: Winter Soldier. Dark World domestic scene works because it's around palace intrigue and I like the vibrance of that movie being the first MCU movie I saw. And also the elevator scene from Winter Soldier is reduxed in a funny way, and the Battle of NY from Avengers 1 also. The other thing is a fight sequence between Thor, Cap, Iron Man against Thanos which is impressive wow. It's here that it also shines. I think these other MCU scenes with a different spin are kinda cool, although I would have liked just to introduce its own thing this movie. I mean you don't see in Avengers 1 them resisting scenes from their solo movies. I know that they want to get this Thanos storyline out of the way though naturally and the whole story is just like the comics pretty much verbatim. Personally I'm ambivalent about that storyline frankly. I actually appreciate the movies that takes an insignificant plot and make something out of it.But you know the good thing is these movies present loads of interviews, panel conferences, and those global cast events that are so entertaining to watch so ti's a win win. Wondering what is the key to happiness for all of those in those interviews. In Fractured Fairytales they say ""the happiest people are busy people"" but that's not quite, it's those who value their masculine and feminine (guys former and women latter obv.) It seems the doorways just open for those type of people, and the busy people-an illusion. I've worked so much and study and the doorways , are they flying open. It's these in these interviews, Scarlett who knows how to be feminine, Brie has a slight masculine to her and you see why people are like what the?? Cap Marvel movie people are not taken with that, it takes place like 2 decades ago and now men have to sit in theater who were around then and have to watch this smarmy lady onscreen, what does this tell you. Gwyneth Paltrow is another masculine, why is she here, the song in stores ""turn your magic on/I feel alive again"", you like that? She was with that guy until he's like no I don't want to deal with this masculine person I just want to make more songs forget this. I don't know the correlation between busy and this m/f thing I just know if you are too much in one it's OK to balance it out with the other thing to keep fun. I j/o every other day. Anyway so the movie has Thor hammer it up, Hulk smashes, Hawkeye lays some serious deep stick arrow, Black Widow looks spiderific, Iron Man unleashes blasts, and Cap just goes in raw."
82,"First of, Infinity War was the greatest MCU movie ever made IMHO.Of course, following it up was never going to be easy, and it's sheer greatness and the impact of the 'snap' was something that the Russos just couldn't navigate a way out of. However, plot difficulties aside, there was really no excuse for some of the poor character treatment and pacing issues that they had.Positives:
RDJ's actingNatasha and Hawkeye's last interactionsCGINegatives:
Abysmally poor treatment of Thor, reduced to a comic relief sideshowAbysmally poor treatment of the Hulk - One of the strongest characters of the MCU didn't fight more than 10secs in the 2 supposedly landmark movies of the MCU??Completely ruined Thanos - reduced to a caricature 'bad guy' after an excellently built character in IWPoor re-introduction of the vanished Avengers - seems most of the team wasn't even paid and they just used some stock footage from previous movies for their blink and you miss appearancesWasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie?Pacing - all over the place. Could easily have trimmed the fat and achieved a much more coherent productMore of a Cap+Stark movie than an Avengers movie.Time travel plotholes - hellloooo. I was OK with the main plan of stealing, snapping, restoring the stones. Hell, I am even OK with Cap getting the happy ending (assuming he stays in hiding his entire life and Carter's life decisions are not affected by the guy in her basement). But as soon as Thanos goes to the future and dies there, Uh Oh - did we just lose the entire Infinity War?? Maybe I am too dumb to understand this...In the end, while the homage to the movies and characters was fine, I really wanted to have a movie I would rush to watch again (Like I did with IW). Sadly, they couldn't deliver this time."
83,"They badly nerfed The Incredible Hulk!!
From the starting till the end the plot was weak and monotonous. They could have thought of many better idea but they had to bring up the stupid time travel thingy.To bad my expectations were shattered."
84,"Where can I even start with this thing? Why do people act like it's one of the greatest, most visionary works in years? It took me three days to get through the whole slog and the more I thought about it afterwards, the worse it got. If it didn't become the highest grossing movie ever I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing it. The fact that it got that much money is truly head-scratching; it was even bad by normal Marvel standards, let alone Scorsese ones. (Infinity War was at least more entertaining.)To all the people calling this a great culmination to so many movies: How could you treat this like any kind of ending? We all know that Disney's going to churn out as many more of these movies as they can, and probably drag RDJ back into it once people finally get sick of them. I've already heard people are clamoring for 'the next Endgame', which shows how much staying power this one has. It'll probably go the same way as Martin and Lewis movies: an extremely popular fad that will eventually become an embarrassment; a punchline.To all the people saying 'something like this has never been done in cinema before': Not exactly. Have you seen Abbot and Costello Meet Frankenstein? You get a crossover between Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolf Man, the Invisible Man, plus Abbot and Costello. Yes, it's not on the same level as Endgame, but it is still something *like* it. To say nothing of the first Avengers movie which was still better than this.And by the way, Martin Scorsese was right. This movie-and all other M 'C' U films made in the past 5-10 years-are not cinema because they have become an extended TV show. This doesn't play at all like a cinematic climax at all, it plays like the last episode of a TV series: a mediocre creation spending an inordinate amount of time referencing the previous episodes. So Avengers Endgame is not cinema the same way the Seinfeld finale is not considered cinema.The visuals: -1 star. They are the usual murky CGI and greenscreens, nothing special at all. They thought they could get an Oscar for this? The final battle is an ugly CGI mess that makes the Ready Player One final battle look like a masterclass. There's no beauty or scale or anything in the battle to visually show that this is supposed to be an epic final struggle; instead it plays out like any other Marvel action scene just with tons more characters thrown in, puking worthless energy beams and buzzing around like flies on a corpse.The soundtrack: +0 stars. It's competent, but quite bland and forgettable. Let's just say that no one will be rushing in line to buy the soundtrack.The plot: -4 stars. Tons of McGuffins, and they must all be collected with time travel. The time travel storyline caused innumerable inconsistencies. Try as the Endgame fans might, there is no way to make sense of this garble. Go back in time to get more Pym particles? Go back in time and kill Thanos in the Infinity War final battle? No, they have to do it *exactly* this way. I seem to remember they refused to save Black Widow after she died because 'the guy said she was dead for sure'. Then Gamora came back even though she died the same way in the previous movie. I don't really have a problem with plot holes generally, but the script just kept calling attention to them in a meta, snarky way. Meanwhile, the entire 'snap' resolve was cheap and lazy; exactly what I expected would happen after finishing Infinity War. So, after 4 years suddenly as all these long dead people just *return*. There is NO way you can explain this in a way to make it sound sane. Meanwhile, Tony Stark's sacrifice scene is rotten. Basically what happens is he grabs all of Thanos' power stones and uses them to do the same thing to Thanos that Thanos was trying to do to them: turn him into dust. So, this Machiavellian mess is the culminating message of the 20-something movie series? The guy with the most power wins using whatever means are available? That's literally everything; it's the only message. The reason the Lord of the Rings had such a great story was that the characters had a massive power, but couldn't use it, and that caused a deep psychological tension. Here there's nothing; just grab the most powerful stuff there is and use it to kill your opponents and 'win'. It sucked. The most real kind of courage is when people know they're going to lose and keep fighting anyway. It would have been nice to have that here instead.The script: -3 stars. We don't expect great scripts from these movies, but at least they're usually funny. This is probably the least funny Marvel movie ever, with barely a single joke landing. (Fat Thor could have been funny but they sucked the humor out of him by having him sulk almost all the time). All of War Machine's 'funny' lines are truly cringey, as are the couple of belated, out of place jokes from the many actors who cameo at the end. So, it isn't funny. The screenplay then drains the rest of its energy trying to cover up plot holes it knows the audience will anticipate, but doesn't even succeed and all that dialogue just highlights the inconsistencies. Case in point: the infamous 'baby Thanos' dialogue. Case in point: the entire stupid 'time travel doesn't work that way' saga. Calling other time travel movies garbage is not a way to give your one a free pass. If they would have just owned up to the plot holes instead of attempting to explain them away with meta, lazy dialogue, it would have been more bearable. And don't even get started on the emotional dialogue, but at least they tried to be somewhat serious for once.The acting: -1 star. I never realized how bad an actor Chris Evans was until he tried to be emotional in this movie. RDJ, once so charismatic and funny, is reduced to the stale shtick of pop-culture references and product placement. Lots of the others looked bored as they spent a huge majority of the movie sulking, moping, getting drunk, having therapy, whining, killing for spite, etc. And then all they can obsess about is reversing their loss so they win; it's even worse than the Democrats after the 2016 election. Are they really that sore of losers? It's been FIVE freaking years! Get over it. It's surprising they didn't just kill themselves in their mire of self-pity.The positive: Well, I can't find any. This is the first one star review I've given on this site."
85,"Boring, and too campy. But, hey it's what Marvel movies are!"
86,Everything is great except the time travel concept.
87,"Stinky paul rudd, doesnt know how to protect a taco. Otherwise the movie is amazing but this one thing taints its whole reputation. Also why did hulk just eat one taco, why didnt antman just shrink and eat the taco"
88,"They absolutely picked THE wrong actor to portray Captain America!He is so anti-America&I know he's acting,but he's never gonna win an award for acting either. Glad he's gone."
89,"I'm a huge fan of avengers but
lost valuable 3 hours of my life."
90,"Another generic Marvel film. Forced jokes. Lots of CGI. The Hulk is a complete joke in this movie (So is Thor), waste of a good actor and character. It's the ultimate Marvel movie, and we don't get to see Hulk go berserk? Totally lame. There was a lot of wasted opportunity in this film, it isn't by any means a great movie. Russo brothers are lame. This movie was so anticlimactic, Marvel tried so hard to give their characters heart and soul as they wrapped up the franchise. If you've seen this movie once there's no need to watch it again."
91,Inept hallucinating nonsense movie with a delirious and boring plot.
92,What is this terrible movie not interesting actions no good story wtf are you doing?
93,"Marvel, after saturating the market for the past ten years with their inane nonsensical storytelling, produces this two part, overacted, painfully endless charade of ed wood like acting and sapping storytelling in ""Avengers Endgame"".Watch as the world sheds tears over the ""death"" of half the marvel universe, at the hands of Thanos, played by a CGI'ied Grimace from McDonald's commercial fame, who looks as tho he has lost 100 pounds of fat and turned it into 100 pounds of purple muscle, an oversized jaw, and aided by a ridiculous golden glove made up of ring pops, which as they are all collected, grant this moronic nihilist the power to over act his lines and ""snap his fingers"" creating destruction and the deaths of badly played characters, portrayed by overpaid bored actors such as Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, snake oil salesmen Gwynth Paltrow, and Scarlett Johansson (who has the acting range of a wet noodle).Anyways this movie sucked, and Disney is a cult for people who can't let go of their childhoods."
94,"They ruined hulk very badly, because even Ironman was fighting with hulk in the movie but not the hulk"
95,"Infinity War is so much better. This movie felt so forced, too many eye rolling gags and a confusing plot. The way Thor and Hulk were handled is criminal."
96,Hulk & Thor massively underpowered & underused! Such a let down for such a build up over 10 years & to follow on from pretty much perfection with Infinity War to this is just madness.Some great scenes but the movie overall didn't flow well for me.
97,"I want to start out saying I love all the Marvel movies leading up to Endgame. I loved Infinity War because it seemed to be setting up a terrific conclusion to the original 6 Avengers story arc's. I was very wrong. Let's start with Tony's Arc. In Ironman 1 Tony is told you are a man who has everything and nothing. In Ironman 2 we find out his dad was distant and cold to him, and in ironman 3 he is getting panic attacks because he thinks it's up to him to save the world from all threats. So in Endgame he finally gets everything that's important. He becomes a Dad and husband and... was proven right by having to die saving the universe himself? Why? Because we are supposed to believe Tony can't retire? Of course he can. Didn't he say to Steve in AoU ""isn't that why we fight so we can end the fight? So we can go home?"" Tony wanted to retire. Tony's arc should have been about being a good dad like his father never was and finally becoming the man who has everything important. He should have learned that he doesn't have to do it all on his own. Team work should have won the final battle. What's the point of finally getting all the Avengers together if it's left to one man to sacrifice himself to save everyone? Tony's ending was not satisfying and it was not the end they have been building towards from the beginning. Now let's talk about the real tragedy in this movie. Steve Rogers character. We know he is a good man who always does what he believes is right. He calls Home the Avengers facility and says he can't ignore a situation that's headed south. He loved Peggy but found out she had gotten married and had a happy life and he tried moving on with her niece. This storyline was ignored which was ok because most of Steves storyline in the MCU has been about saving Bucky. You remember him right? Steve didn't seem to for the entire movie. Instead of thinking about Sam and Bucky and all the people they are going to save if their plan works when they find Thanos in the beginning of Endgame Steve's just looking at the Peggy compass that he hasn't looked at in at least 3 movies. Why? So we can all forget about his actual character development and think it's a great ending when he goes back in time to be with Peggy. I'm just going to ignore all the plot holes associated with Steve going back in time and just focus on the character assasination this commits. This means the same guy who says he can't ignore a situation headed south, who never ran away from a fight, who said I'm with you till the end of the line"" to Bucky is just going to live out his life in the past never saving his friend from being a brain washed assassin, never saving his other friends parents from being killed by his best friend, never stopping any of the thousands of bad things he would know are going to happen? That's not Steve. The writers never let Steve get a personal life. He never found someone after Peggy and he never had anything except the Avengers. He was the one that was set up to die. The final battle starts with what is probably the most epic scene in comic book movie history but fizzles our soon after. Doctor Stranges plan makes no sense. How was this the only way they could win? Why couldn't Captain Marvel snap? Why couldn't captain Marvel just fly the gauntlet to another galaxy? Why couldn't Doctor Strange open a portal and drop the gauntlet on some random planet? In Infinity War why didn't Doctor Strange use his portal to go to Wakanda and tell Thor to aim for the head. The characters powers were very inconsistent for the first time in the MCU. Why was Thanos with no infinity stones able to fight Mjolnir and Storm Breaker but Thanos with all 6 stones would have lost to Storm Breaker if Thor would have just aimed for the head? Why can Captain Marvel fly through a huge spaceship 10 times but she gets knocked out after one punch from Thanos? Why does no one attack Thanos at the same time as someone else? Where's the big team up? You would think getting everyone together for the first time would have been the only way to defeat Thanos, but you'd be wrong because it's all about Tony stark. Even Steve picking up Mjolnir means nothing really because it has no affect on the end of the battle. Thor and Steve could be taken out of this movie and nothing would change. They do nothing of importance. This movie seems so disconnected from Infinity War that it's boggles my mind how this movie has the same writers and directors as Infinity War and it was filmed at the same time as Infinity War. How can you get one so wrong and the other so right? It seems clear to me that the writers and directors decided that Tony was dying and Steve was going back to the past no matter how much their story suffered from doing it. It's like they had a check list of things to put in the movie without actually making a good story that fit in with the rest of their movies. This is by far the most dissapointing ending to anything I've ever looked forward to."
98,Seriously? This is what everyone was talking about of being so brilliant? The plot has a lot of holes and also the movie is very long and boring until the third act
99,"This is not like the rest, paid for review, this is honest!! As a fan of Captain America since the 80's, I have grown to hate the Avengers movies, this one & Infinity War!!! They have become so unbelievably unbelievable it's pathetic!! This one starts days after Infinity War ends & the ""rescue"" of Iron Man by Disney's new, ultra strong (stronger than a god for Disney) Captain Marvel!! She never existed in any other Avengers movie as people know!! After helping him get home, she basicutakes charge & leads they remaining team to Thanos & guess what, they kill him & Thor is the one that does it with Caption Marvel basically in control of Thanos!!! Then it moves 5 years in the future & they decide to time travel since Ant Man returns & tells them about it!! They get the team back together but find Thor looking like the Dude from the Big Lebowski!!! He is also a drunk & an over weight slob, (this is Disney mind you, supposed to be for kids)!!! They try to get Iron Man but he has a family now & refuses, only to join in as everyone knew he would!!
Let's fast forward an hour to they time travel & get the stones with Black Widow giving her own life to get the soul stone!! They get back to headquarters & Hawkeye, who is the main focus for some reason tells them she's dead!! They have a moment of silence & move on like that!!
We move to the final hour & the final fight with Thanos from the past. None of the Avengers can handle the gauntlet glove they make & are getting beat, almost get destroyed until Disney's new, stronger than a god Caption Marvel shows up & destroys Thanos ship by herself!! She pretty much takes charge again, beating the crap out of Thanos, not even a god could do what she was doing!! The rest of the ""hero's"" show up that were ""killed"" in the last & tony puts his own life at risk by taking the stones & using them to end Thanos the sameway he used it in the last movie!! It ends with a memorial for Tony & Steve taking the stones back in time to where they belonged in the past, before Thanos got them the first time!! When you think about it, they did not stop Thanos because to do that, they would have needed to kill his mother or killed him right after birth, so think on what will still happen!! There is also no sign of Disney's super duper hero because she is not needed to save the others, including a god!! After Steve put the stones back, he went back to 45 & stayed, only to show up in the 2020's as an old man who is over 100 years old & looks like he's in his 70's!!!
You see the screw ups? It starts with the first Iron Man movie!! They put him in modern times & that can't be!! Why you ask, Howard Stark & Tony's mother would be in their 70's by the time Tony is born!! In this movie, Tony goes to 1970 & sees his dad & his dad even mentioned that Tony was not born yet!! Howard, if you know his back story, was working on the Captain America formula for the government in WW1!! That means, he would have been born in the 1890's!!! By not staying with the original material, you get everything out of wack!!!
Let's move to Thor, he's a god as I made clear already, that means he is not a mortal & can't die, means he is the most powerful of the Avengers but he can't stop Thanos for nothing & an earthling that is Carol Danvers can handle Thanos like he's nothing?
Disney has not only failed with these movies but has ruined Marvel movies that could have been good!! The mindless Disney drones do not want to see these facts & think Disney has done great!! It's past time these movies ended & Disney is removed from everything they are involved with except what Disney started as, a family owned & family oriented company!!!"
100,"I dont see why people think its that great. We already know whats gonna happen. They just copy it from the comics. You want a good superhero movie. Make the movie first, then the comic book. It will save time and money."
101,"I might be the only one to say this but this movie is bad. When I was in cinema I enjoy some moments in the movie however there were things that went completely against canon of Marvel universe as well there are some continuity errors creating even time paradox.Pleae note that the bellow text will contain some spoilers from the movie as well as explanation of the time paradox. I apologize in advance becase some parts might be hard to understand (especially the time paradox occurence) but due to this issues I cannot approve this movie as a good one.There are some spoilers bellow (regarding the movie, not tha comics). First I will make one small shortcut to Avengers - Infinity Wars:****
Thanos snapped his fingers and wipe-out half of the galaxy.
****Please make a not to this because this will be quite important to the time paradox created in this movie.But first the good things:
CGI - there is no denying that a lot of money were put into this moive and it is is paying off;casting - perfect, quite a lot of parts were funny and really enjoyable;captain Marvell - I am really glad that at least some continuity was not broken: many yourubers and people speculated after Infinity War that she will be able to defeat Thanos, I am happy (I also opposed these people in comments) that she was not able to defeat him (there are only three characters that were in the movies that could defeat Thanos when he would not be wearing his infinity gauntlet, and let me tell you captain Marvell is definitelly not one of them, so this is one star more to movie);Bad things:
first half of the movie is without any action, everyone is beaten and the only one who saved this part is fat Thor (for those wondering why he is on Earth go and watch Thor Ragnarok);I don't know why Ant-Man was given such big role and I simply don't even understand it, there are many other surviving characters;(spoiler) Iron-Man dies - why? Pure screenwriting - the only thing that can explain it. Iron-Man was definitelly not the worst hero when it came to generating the profit in Marvell Universe movies so killing him is simply bad;do you know how could our heroes obtain the soul stone? IF and only IF the sacrifice would be made; but the issue is that they did not know that - not even Thanos knew that when he tried to get it in Infinity Wars, so the fact that in two separate film the plot allows to make this sactrifice is really bothering me - Thanos killed Gamora in order to obtain it in Infinity Stones, in Endgame Black Widow sacrificed herself for Hawkeye to get it. Still not seing the issue? What would happen if only one of them would come for the Soul Stone? What would happen if let's say Hawkeye and Thor would come for Soul Stone? Avengers did not know about this condition yet they somehow made the right decission;Worst thing of all (spoiler ahead):
Thanos dies. This does not make sense and it even cannot make sense.At the beginning I wrote that Thanos snapped his fingers and wipe-out half of the galaxy, do you remember? So what would happen if Thanos was killed before he would do this? Exactly - it would create time paradox. Why?
during the movie our reamaing super-heroes travel through time in order to gather the stones themselves so they could revers the effect of what Thanos did;Thanos (in the past) learned about this plot from future Nebula because she was linked to past Nebula (total bs but let's leave this as it is);thanks to past Nebula he was able to travel to his future so he could obtain the infinity gauntlet the easy way;Avengers were able to gather all stones and put them to the gauntlet and in some time during the creation Iron-Man put obviously some mechanism so in case something bad would happen he would be able to get the stones by himself;Iron-Man used infinity gauntlet to wipe-out whole Thanos army as well as killing Thanos himself;WOW - we have time paradox right? Because Thanos who was responsible for wiping out half of the galaxy was killed before he could wipe-out the half of the galaxy thus there was no reason to kill him because no one of avengers knew what he would be planning (they even could not know him) however if there was no reason to kill him nor knowing him he could continue with his plan to gather the stones etc....There are some other major issues in the movie but in the light of the time paradox none of those issues really matters."
102,"All the hype and then we had a very bad movie, Infinity War was a great build up for Endgame but the approach was so so bad, time travel to save the dead was a very bad move, so no drama and the end couldn't save the movie, and I'm still wondering why all the hype over Captain Marvel and at the end she was useless?..... Well 2 is more than enough for this mess"
103,"My kids were very excited to see this but I was more apprehensive. Really, the film is far too long, just unnecessarily. Parts of this film were very boring and were an ideal time for a cinema snooze! It had so much more potential but directors lost site of their aim. Disappointed."
104,"Love adventure, superheroes and Marvel, but this movie was awful and completely booring. This should have been made into a 15 minute ending of the previous movie. Don't understand who this appeals to. We were a mixed gender group and all of us just waited for it to finally end. Don't except anything exciting or interesting. The plot is easy to see through and they fail miserably to create any emotional connection with the audience."
105,"Doesn't deserve to be a sequel to The Great ""Infinity War"" . Highly Disappointed , Ruined the 20+ Movie Build-Up . Disappointed ."
106,"It was straight up a huge disappointment, and a really bad ending to a great saga"
107,"Finally got around to watching this film. I wanted to like it... I'll stick with Logan , Deadpool and the gritty old Batman's. It's clear the direction Disney is going to take marvel and it's straight to cartoon land."
108,"Such a chore to watch. As unimaginative as film making goes. Could there be some actual humour or even interesting visual ideas or anything? It's just talking heads spouting boring dialogue filmed boringly. Whoa, these have gone bad."
109,"Unicorns and rambows, girlpower and pointlessness, they tried to hatch astory together but the main villian which they tried to kill in prevous movie was now left to rot on some plannet and gets killed in seconds."
110,"As others have said time travel is always a cop out, but there seem to be some major problems with it's use here, first is the fates of black widow and gamora, we are told (by the writer in the bluray commentary) that black widow can't be brought back because the fate of obtaining the soul stone can't be undone, yet gamora seems to have undone here fate from the same choice. The small point that if gamora never made the choice due to the time travel, then in fact none of the events in the previous could never have happened as Thanos would have been one stone short seems to be ignored.
Then you have Captain America's fate, he time travels back and lives out his days as agents Carters secret husband, cool. Unfortunately this then means that within the MCU universe He also has a reactionship with agent 13, technically his own great niece, whoops."
111,"So I could go back and stop myself from seeing this film! ""Infinity War"" was a masterpiece compared to this. Marvel please undo the 181 minutes of my life!Earlier we could count at least on some action scenes in Marvel movies. Not today Thanos! There is barely any action in the movie and the CGI they used in fights was extremely low quality and painful to watch. Even some basic fights and tricks were not choreographed by actors but made of a cheap looking, crappy CGI. This is unacceptable for such a budget.The story is so bad even a 5-yo child could write better. Some people are sobbing for AGES (I do understand a pain of loss but come on aren't you called superheroes for a reason?) Other people just appear out of nowhere doing their things with no explanation whatsoever. How in the world did this garbage get 9\10 rating is a mystery. I guess it's a real Endgame..."
112,"Yes, you heard it right. It was very badly written. Like the time-travel system is so weird. They tried to be unique with it but failed."
113,Don't waste 3 hours of your life. There are only special effects are interesting.
114,"Such a high tension left from Infinity war ,
and then such fast bad solutions...with nonsense. bad sense of humor.
i was disappointed.
Maybe for teenagers around 14-15 years old thats pretty ok."
115,Overhyped overrated movie. Plot Holes. Ruined Characters. Not waste your time
116,Please don't waste your time on this...Its very boring. It's like they pre-sell the movie with a good ending of infinity war. Its a rip off. Trust me you won't believe this. I quite after 30 minutes.I am writing this review to alert people: keep your money and time for something else.
117,Where to start???? This is such a bad movie that I am so disappointed with Marvel. Can't believe critics who are rating such movies so high. Its very clear that we cannot go by what critics say. Good movies are bad and bad movies are good!!
118,"What have you done? What were you thinking? 21 movies in and this is the best you can come up with?
I'm not sure where to start. Have you worked so long on all these films that you got burnt out? Do you hate the Hulk and Thor characters so much that you would do what you did to them?
Time travel to fix things is just lazy writing. Plain and simple. Lazy, unimaginative, boring, and it will always fail to make sense.
Let's just start at the beginning of the film. It's the best part other than how did Captain Marvel finds Tony but we can let that slide. It really does not matter.
Five years later was your first mistake. By doing this you have shown the world is in collapse. People can not move on. Garbage everywhere, everything is in decay. Only Tony Stark has seen to be able to move on and have a child and be happy. Great. This is where it gets bad.
You have made Tony Stark completely selfish again. Just like his first film. He never wants to sacrifice anything of his own to make things right. You gave him a daughter and the second you did that, the second you did that, you had to take her away. You had no choice if you wanted to make it a good movie. That is what he was going to have to lose to fix what had been done by Thanos. But you do not even make it an option.
He stipulates that they can all go back in time as long as they don't change the last five years! Why?! The whole world is in mourning. The world sucks. How many people killed themselves after the snap? How many people lost everything they own after the snap? How many children lost their parents? How many parents lost their children? But Tony is happy, so, that's all that matters. Horrible. You made me hate Tony Stark.
Next point. Why do they need a spaceship to go to Thanos? Thor has Stormbreaker. Stormbreaker can make a bifrost bridge to anywhere! Thor can go anywhere he wants now. Anywhere! No spaceship needed.
Thanos? What did you do to the villain you made so great in the previous film. He has five years in retirement and he's ready to die? Let me explain something to you guys. People do not spend their entire lives to achieve something only to want to die five minutes after they achieve it.
Thanos. Poor Thanos. What you did. Thanos would never, ever just sat there and let himself be killed. He knew when he did the snap that people would come after him. He would have been ready. He would have never of destroyed the stones. They would be his greatest protection.
Now that you killed Thanos and you destroyed the stones, you put yourselves in a box. How can we fix this? I know, time travel. Quantum Realm time travel. Side note, Janet Van Dyne (Mrs Pym) was in the Quantum Realm for 30 years and she aged 30 years. We'll forget about that movie though.
Then you guys think we'll go back and get all the stones from earlier movies. Wrong! You don't have to. All you needed to do was go back and get the Tesseract and the time stone. The Tesseract to travel the galaxy. (Which you really don't need because of Stormbreaker but never mind that) and the time stone to fix the time line. The infinity stones are much more powerful than you guys think or realize. Watch the first Guardians of the Galaxy film if you do not know what I mean.
You guys made the script so much harder on yourselves than you had to be. Maybe this is what happens when people spend too much time on one type of characters.
Did you guys forget who the characters are? Captain America does not look at his own ass and make a comment. He does not care. It is not in his personality at all in any other film. He does not have any vanity. It is one of the reasons that Peggy Carter likes him.
Thor. Poor, poor, Thor. Your lazy writing here is unforgivable. The fat Thor was funny for 15 seconds and then it was irritating for the rest of the film. You should have never of done it. Thor should have been traveling the nine realms with stormbreaker, trying to help those realms recover from the snap. That's what Thor would have been doing. Thor would have tried to do something productive. All of Thor's previous movies meant nothing to you. The character meant nothing to you. How Chris Hemsworth played that part without crying in every scene is beyond me. I hope he was devastated to what you did to his character.
The Hulk? Do you guys even know who he is? You hid him in the infinity wars, it was okay. I got it. It made it different, but not to bring him back or to bring him in the way you did here, is beyond belief. We needed to see that transformation. We needed to see how Banner and the Hulk became one. Okay, forget that, you did let us see Banner in the Hulk form but we never got to see a smart Hulk get revenge on Thanos. A smart Hulk who knows how to fight because he is now smart because you wrote him that he is now smart. Wasted opportunity.
Vision by the way. No resurrection? No mention at all. Really?
Hawkeye? There's a guy that enjoyed the last five years. Maybe Tony would like to lose his family and not to want to change the last five years.
Another problem. After the new snap, when you brought everyone back. Hawkeye's wife came back with her cell phone? He has her cell phone charged and on the kitchen counter waiting for her to come back? Did the cell phone company's service survive the snap? Are you telling me that Clint kept the same cell phone plan for five years? Think about that for a second. And this not something I realized after the film. I realized it as it a occurred, sitting in my seat in the theater. Bad writing.
Romanoff. She never needed to die because you never needed the Soul stone and two things on that: When Captain America returns the the Soul stone, did he see the Red Skull? That would have been interesting. And second when he returns the Soul Stone, Romanoff comes back too! Another thing you guys did not think that through though.
Ant-man? I love Paul Rudd, but Ant man was useless. His daughter does not miss her Mom though? I guess she is like Tony and does not want to undo the last five years.
No Fury and Captain Marvel reunion scene? Why not? Don't really care that it was not there, but hey I should at least mention it.
Back to Captain America. He would never had stayed in the past and married Peggy. He would not have taken her away from the man she winds up marrying and having kids with. He would never had done that in a million years. He would not have abandoned Bucky. Bucky has no family or friends. None. Steve would not have left hm. Steve would not have left all the people that he had met after the snap. Those people still need help.
Let me explain your own script to you. When they reverse the snap and everybody reappears after a five year gap. When Peter Parker goes back to school, half his class is gone. They have all aged and graduated. Make sure you have that in the next Spiderman movie. Plus, the people that came back, did they go back to work? The jobs were still there? How about all the houses that have begun to rot? Who repaired them all? What about people who moved and got remarried? Yeah, let's not remove the last five years. Lets just leave it all intact.
What should have happened is what happens in Marvel movies. It should have been fun. It should have made sense. Captain Marvel, who is really the only one able to hold any infinity stones,should of, with the help of all the other characters, gone back in time. With the use of the time stone and the tesseract. She shows up when Thor hits Thanos with Stormbreaker at the end of Infinity Wars and she cuts off Thanos's arm before he does the snap or takes the glove from him. Then Thor kills Thanos or lets him live for another day and Captain Marvel uses the Tesseract to open a portal and disappear before anyone even gets to ask her a question. Timeline in tack. Captain Marvel returns the Soul stone to a very unhappy Red Skull who is now trapped on Vormir again and Gamora returns from the Soul stone.
Thanos could have been alive and chasing all the other characters. Trying to stop them from undoing everything he had done. Better yet, he should have had an arc and realized that what he had done did not go as planned and in the end he lets them win.
Either way the movie should have ended with Tony giving up his daughter, sacrificing his new family to give everyone else their families back.
After all is done. Captain America could have just retired and passed the mattel along. Tony would have retired too after seeing how great life is with Pepper and then tried to make his daughter again.
All of these endings are better than what you did but they are also not perfect. I just don't have all the time in the world to think up better ways to make other peoples films.
What I do have time though, is to go to movies and enjoy them from time to time and for the last 11 years I have enjoyed most Marvel films. Sadly to say but I think I am done with Marvel. I feel as if you guys, the Russo Brothers have killed it all. All the build up, all the time spending with these characters just so you could change them and ruin them the way you did. I feel as if they have died.
I know my opinion is just that, my opinion. I feel that this movie is this generations Return of the Jedi. I loved Jedi when it came out. 5 years later, I hated it. End Game will be that movie for these young people. They love it now, but give it a few years and we will see.
This I guess is my obituary for the mcu. I felt so empty after seeing this movie. I felt like it was all a waste. I felt like my friends had died or left me and were not coming back. I needed to get this all out of my system and just say good-bye.
I apologize for my poor grammar. If I could get the Time Stone, I would use it to go back to school and actually listen to my English teacher.
This is all a very sad ending to what could have been a great era of movies."
119,Thank god it's all over.... Safe the worst for last. No more marvels please. 10 years is way too much and long.
120,3 hours of crap. One guy says time is not linear and damn! Quantum physics solved.
121,"It's not Perfect as we imagine, There is so many curious in avengers infinity war ending & that's why people came to watch this movie in theaters.. It's not the best movie in Avengers Series."
122,"The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie."
123,"It's hard to believe that this is the highest grossing movie of all time. It's not even that good of a Marvel movie.I understand that this is based on a comic book characters but damn! The fact that this movie is so successful is pretty much the reason why Hollywood thinks they can get away making movies that aren't all that well thought out but look cool. The first hour was downright painful to get through and if they had taken out a lot of the unnecessary crap, this movie easily could have been 2 hours long."
124,"This movie was a complete mess, after all the years of build up, I didn't care.
It was like putting an entire smörgåsbord into a very small bowl. All the flavours and textures blended and lost their appeal.
Only two characters stood out, Thor and Antman."
125,"I just sleeping in the movie theather, because, okay this is a ""Endgame"", but this movie doesn't have action and i didn't know why this movie don't a sink me."
126,"If you go see this movie, go see it in an IMAX 3D or something like that because 3 hours is too long for this movie.The story is really bad I van understand that they don't want to repeat the same story in the comic book but the reason why Thanos choose to wipeout half the population is just stupid and what he do after that? Yeah he destroy the stone and retire. What a great villain...So our super hero go take care of Thanos easily and then nothing for a very long period of time. For a Marvel movie their is not much action and for an intelligent, deep or funny movie that's not a bad thing but for a movie like this it's just boring. I guess they think that since their is a lot of action at the end that we will forget the middle.They other thing that really bother's me is how important it seem to show how strong women are. The power of women yeah... Men are lazy, dumb and useless like thor in this movie and women are strong and save the day like Captain Marvel, Valkyrie, Gamora etc.Marvel's writers must understand that Easter eggs, some action at the end of the film and showing the power of feminity do not make up for a bad script.the only thing that I really like in this movie is that finally we saw some hero die."
127,"So bad. Oh so bad. The estrogen in this one is nauseating. Only one Avenger is a figure in the mythology of white people- Thor, and it is the one that must be turned into a blubbering fat wuss as a result. I tried to get through it but I really couldn't.Movies these days- so bad. Oh so bad."
128,"This was supposed to be the final movie that crowed the franchise and Infinity War set high expectations. I was utterly disappointed. The plot doesn't make sense and throws away a lot of character development, to the point that some of them are just shallow version of what they were in other movies (and could become).But what really annoyed me was the sentimentalism that permeated the whole movie. It is like you have to shed a tear for every character and the movie is trying to make you cry in scenes that don't move the plot forward. If in Infinity War they really stroke a good balance between action and emotion, here they just are there for the sake of it."
129,Glad I only wasted $4 watching this awful movie. 3 hrs I never get back . I really liked Guardian of the galaxy and infinity war . But this is just trash .
130,There was nothing unexpected in this one. Of course the characters that were dead somehow came back to life. We all knew that had to happen before we watched it.Obviously this kind of movie is made for children and for adults with the minds of children. But I can't imagine any normal adult enjoying it.
131,So i just watched it for the second time yesterday and i have to be honest this movie is boring as hell until the final fight and now that I watched it for the second time the final fight was ok this movie is so overated in my eyes firat time i watched it i was nearly falling asleep in theater because nothing intersting was happenning people going to hate me for this but I dont care I had more fun watching Dark Phonenix then this boring ass movie mcu movies are so overated in my opinion!
132,"As generic and cookie cutter and dull and boring as 'movies' can possibly be... I love how all the overgrown, second adolescence/ immature 'adults' talk about how 'moved' they are by this kind of garbage. It's fine for kids. Adults are just dumb for liking rubbish like this... This bores me to tears..."
133,"I have read better fanfic stories than this. It feels like the Russos tried to fix their plot holes by digging deeper. The humor was so cringy and nonsensical! If in a room full of 500 Marvel fans, only 5 persons laugh at the fat jokes, then you must ask yourself if it was really necessary. Because yeah, Thor, grieving and hopeless, became fat and... THAT WAS THE JOKE! Tony, almost a skeleton, inspires sympathies, but Thor, who is fat, is a joke. He's fat! That's the actual joke! WTF Russos??
The time travel doesn't make any sense. At all. No matter how many times it's repeated throughout the movie, it simply doesn't.
Can we also talk about Captain America whose character evolution went downhill?
Bruce Banner with the body of the Hulk is... I just don't have words anymore.
I give up. It was a terrible movie, filled with plot holes and regressive character dev. I lost 3 hours of my time I'll never get back and i'm sad that 10 years of being a hardcore MCU fan ended with THAT.
Side note: Scott Lang and Peter Parker are A++++ Not enough to save the movie though."
134,"The only good thing about the movie is that the time went by fast, but I will admit that I found myself looking around the theater often because some of the scenes were dragged outThere were inconsistencies with the first movie.Thor was a wussThis was the Iron Man show so he could go out like a hero who would sacrifice himself for the ones he loved.Thanos was just as powerful or more so without the Infinity Stones than with. At least it appeared that way to me. The only thing the infinity stones did was give him the ability to wipe out anyone and everyone with a snap of the fingers.Captain Marvel was useless.It almost made it seem like the guys were incompetent until the woman showed up. Then we had the Power Girls convention for a few moments in the middle of the battle with hundreds or thousands coming at them.Biggest waste of my money ever."
135,"In the movie they say that the time travel will not affect the past?! How is that possible?
Thor even stole the hammer from his past!!!
He left him without a hammer!!!!Hulk basically he didn't have any fight! He did not even got revenge from the last time he fought with thanos.Captain Marvel could just have killed the Thanos without the stones all by herself!"
136,"Overated, boring nonsense! Infinity war set me up for what I thought was going to be the best marvel movie ever but end game felt like it was trying too hard to please everyone! Instead of just being a really good marvel movie.
The plot holes were a big part of the disappointment for me."
137,"Watching Avengers Endgame started as a nice story that soon became boring and predictable. The problem is that it's supposed to end an era, to be a big moment before the curtain fall, but instead tries to pave the way for Marvell phase 4. There were some interesting moments, some funny moments that really made me smile, but at the end it all fell flat. Flat as a rug. They tried to cram each and everyone in the movie, but in my opinion it feels fake, like parading with fake cardboard masks. The CGI-fest soon became boring...except for the de-aging of Michael Douglas, that was 100% uncanny valley material. I was watching it feeling nothing, feeling dead inside. Then the woke trend rear its ugly head. Anyway, it's safe to say that I'll avoid Marvel in the future. The Endgame should stay the endgame. It's time to move on."
138,"I feel so strongly about how bad this movie was I had to open an account on IMDB just to vent so I can get some closure on the matter. Firstly it ruined date night with the wife, usually date night ends with fun times .. but not after this .. I mean how could we ? The mood was dead, just like the plot. I loved Infinity war, so I was really looking forward to this. Half hour in I got that sinking feeling, I tried to shake it and stay positive but to no avail. I got to the point where it was so painful I made a conscious decision to rather have a sleep that to endure the dreadful plot and weak representation of our much loved hero's. We were lied to at the end of Infinity War. When Fury drops his pager and calls for Captain Marvel, we did not know she was would be accompanied by Major Disappointment. Her character was pitched to save the day but she was incapable of doing that - half the movie we did not even know where she was. As for the other characters, Thor / Hulk / Star Lord, I have no words, I don't know these people. Sigh."
139,Story not good .. that's way i don't like this type of move.
140,"This movie was a joke,average superhero movie where the heroes win and everyone's happy, hounestly zero dialogue this whole thing is just liked because marvel is ending, this movie made people ""cry""?really?the only thing that made me cry was my money I spent on seeing this garbage, thor was ruined along with hulk, thanks was dumber down,and capitain marvels horrible scenes were pain full to sit through,hounestly I'm glad people are coming to their senses and rating this movie lower now that they rewatch it, it's full of plot holes and the time travel is embarrassing lazy writing that's a disgrace to real time travel movies,besides the hype this movie had nothing it was 100% hypebased in fact I dont think anyone acctually paid attention to the movie, the ending was extremely predictable and the final battle was bland with the only background colors being brown and destroyed ships so disapointing after the amazing movie that showed that superhero movies can be more then saving the day and the bad guys losing"
141,"After just finishing watching each of the marvel movies in chronological order so everything was fresh in my mind I was anxiously anticipating this movie. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I would have been happier if they'd made no end game movie and just left things open ended after infinity war. I felt the same disappointment after watching a DC movie, and marvel seemed to be the only hope left with super hero movies, and this sadly proved me wrong. They wasted so much time on going back in time with the infinity stooges and going into boring time lines and not enough time filling in blanks and expanding more on the characters we loved the same way they did in IW. It's sad this is how all these years of movies was wrapped up. What a disgrace. I actually left the theatre angry. I don't agree with how they left things with Thor, it doesn't line up with his character at all. It's like there were new writers and directors that had no idea who these characters even were and just tried to be funny."
142,"Ruined all the previous movies just for the sake of fan service.
And ""Time Travel"" it looks good if it has a small part in it, but making a whole movie out of it is stupid. So many plotholes...."
143,"This movie lacked everything that made its predecessor Infinity War so great. The comedic take on Thor was the worst part of the whole 22 movie franchise. The pace of the movie was slow and boring. Overall, this movie is one big disappointment."
144,"It is getting very boring now.
not realistic at all"
145,"Too bad there isn't a zero star rating. I am not the target demo, was dragged to the movie theater by my young son to see it (he thought the movie was OK. I didn't.1. Lots of nothing much happens
2. Lots of melodramatic music
3. The movie at 182 minutes is about 82 minutes too long
4. The Thor character ceases to become comic amusement about a third through the pic
5. Incomprehensible and repeated fight scenes
6. Exceptionally poor dialog in the screenplayVisually the only star turns were Brie Larson and Elizabeth Olsen. The Scarlet Witch, one of the stronger themes was barely in this - Olsen should get her own movie.I was three hours of my life back plus $68 bucks spent on tickets and popcorn at AMC."
146,"Watch this movie, it can be far worse! I understand that Infinity War set a high bar but this one is a joke; time travel, better known as ""deus ex machina"" for lazy writing, is primary thing here that was never explained.And trust me, that is the least of the problems!Yes, the effects were nice so hence 2/10 but effects were never so important in Avengers; others at least had some sort of story and action, this one is dull."
147,If you like spending three hours listening to explosions and ridiculous plot then this is the movie for you.
148,Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's no way an all-time top ten film
149,"3 hours out of my life I will never get back.
not worth the hype. you think the soap opera is done by the ultimate battle.
think again. let us milk it and release another spider man. geez a lou."

151,"This movie was disappointing! It didn't make sense to kill off Thanos in the first 10 min of the movie.The whole timeline opens up to many plot holes.You can tell Captain a marvel was an afterthought. They literally had he on the movie for 15 min runtime!This movie could have been saved if:1. No Time Travel
2. More Captain Marvel
3. Less Grieving scenes, (We get it)
4. More Actjon!!!"
152,"One of the best comic book movie villains was ruined.
Who writes this thing? Time travel? Really? Result:
Film full of plot holes.
Unsatisfying deaths of main characters Tony and Natasha.
Previously cool - now ruined characters Thor and Hulk.
I feel like Thanos today."
153,"After 21 other pretty great and fun movies, these last two Avengers movies are such a let down . After Infinity I did guest that time travel would be introduced, which is so lame and irritating. Very disappointing!"
154,"So boring and they ruined so much character I was really disappointed and let down if your a fan of Thor or hulk
don't watch"
155,"I don't even know where to begin on this dumpster fire of a movie. It really made me emotional. Not because it's sad but because I'm in disbelief that I live in a world where this horrible thing not only exists, but is also the most profitable movie of all time. It was really hard to get through this movie because of how insufferably boring it was.I guess I'll start from the beginning:The first hour of this movie is so irrelevant that if you removed it, the plot would not be effected at all. I sat there for 64 minutes (yes, I was counting) WAITING for something interesting or exciting to happen.Hawkeye is literally a disgrace. In many ways. The fact he became a crazy murderous assassin and the Avengers knew about it the whole time but ignored it for years, the fact he's not deaf like his character should be (although that doesn't relate to this specific movie so it didn't effect my rating), and the fact that his character didn't die instead of Nat's.That whole ""No! If anyone's gonna die here, it's ME!"" ""No, I'm gonna die!"" ""SURPRISE, it's ME that's dying!"" fight they had was fun and stuff but we all know that he was the one who really deserved to die and the fact he didn't is anger-inducing to say the least.Thor is another disgrace. I usually love Thor and they turned him into a joke for everyone to make fun of. Is this how they treat depression and PTSD? Fat jokes and fortnite? Really? Did a 12 year old write this script? I'm not even going to get into the travesty that is their ""Hulk"".And on a slightly different note, I'm mad that they found some way to bring Gamora back and yet they couldn't be bothered to revive Loki, a literal god who has died many times before, back to life. What?!?! And yes, this effected my rating because Loki is an iconic antihero and he DESERVED to be in this movie to help them fight Thanos.Small thing that upset me but not enough to effect my rating: Tony not being more upset about losing Peter. It took him awhile to agree to the time travel thing which I understand because he was worried for his daughter, but he also has a SON. Peter literally treats him like a father and this man had the audacity to say ""hmm, maybe we shouldn't"" while cleaning off a picture of them together that he had FRAMED inside his house?Speaking of Peter, he's the only reason I agreed to watch this movie and he shows up 2 hours and 17 minutes into it. That being said, the part where Tony and Peter reunite and they hug and Peter is like ""oh, this is nice"", was the single greatest part of the movie for me and is the entire reason that I rated this a 3/10 instead of a 1/10.Finally, what is with that time jump thing? So, it doesn't get reversed and all the disappeared have been missing for 5 years. How old is Peter then?! I know his body is still 16 but for all intents and purposes he's technically 21 now, right? He's still in high school at 21? Can he drink alcohol if his legal age is 21 but he's physically only 16? Like if he shows his ID, it'll say he's 21 right? How does this time jump fit into the Marvel universe and how do they work around it? These are the questions I have and there are many.My final rating is 3/10, like I mentioned, specifically because of the Tony and Peter hug. But also for Tom Holland because he did such a great job in the five seconds of screentime he got. He's truly the best Spiderman yet.I didn't want to watch this movie at all but was convinced. I wish I had listened to my gut and never watched it because I wasted three hours of my life."
156,"I have watched the movie when it was just released. A couple of months later and I was looking at the reviews. I cannot believe all the 10/10 scores for this movie.Personally I was extremely disappointed with this final movie. Infinity war was an amazing good movie, end game delivers a very simple story based on the time machine concept with plenty of flaws. While I understand the hype and the popularity of the MCU the movie was not bringing me what I was hoping for. There is no further clarification of what led to this movie. The new hulk is another example what I believe was too far fetched. But I don't think I should continue. Surely it is a must see, but for me remains Endgame one of the less convincing movie of this long series of movies brought to us in the las ten years."
157,Ridiculous....if you die in past how the heck are you alive in future... Blind and idiot fans says this is a masterpiece....
158,"I really wanted to tell this. I hate this movie. It's bad in so many points.Let's start from beginning.
Actually, movie starts strong. Not as good as better movies but I enjoyed the fact that Thanos destroyed Infinity Stones. He did what he thought was a good thing.Then things started going downhill. 5 year gap and it's shown so badly. 5 years is a long time period. Yet they try to convey that almost nothing has happened. I get that lots of people disappeared and many people couldn't cope with that. But man, the dialogue by characters... It's not a dialogue that people will say after 5 years. They speak as if they were set apart for about 3 weeks. Noone aside of Thor changed really. It looks bad.Then there's all time travel. They make completely incomprehencible mess of time traveling mechanic and have audacity to say that ""Back to the Future is a BS"". Right. A movie that has more time-changing little details than flaws is a BS but a movie with questionable time travel is legit. GREAT.Then there's entire plot and changes in characters. I'm sorry, but the way how Tony asks to only return those who were removed by Thanos is... Well, it not just doesn't make any sense. It's even worse. If this wasn't a writer's fantasy but rough reality, a ton of people would appear just to die in seconds - airplanes that fell because pilots disappeared, That crashed helicopter in the end of Infinity War definitely isn't coming back. And suddenly world got way more population than planet's ecosystem was ready for. Which means, that we are back to overpopulation, but now it's even worse. Thank you, Tony Stark, you made your way of character development from greedy self-centered jerk to an actual hero and ended being greedy self-centered jerk in the end. Thank you, Marvel. Thank you. Needs of the few exceed the needs of the many, true.Also, whole time skip feels as if movie script was re-written several times during movie production.Next is the humor. Oh god, the humor. I mean, I felt literally uncomfortable because of selfie with Hulk joke. And Fortnite joke felt as bad. Thor now is a laughing stock. Scene that should have been endeering and strong when he talks to his mother is ruined by terrible humor. There are only few jokes that work in the movie. Tells a lot considering that in Shazam that has WAY more emphasis on the humor, jokes feel more sincere and actually funny and I actually laughed at them. Here jokes actually ruin pacing and make me feel uncomfortable.Finally, characters - I was surprised how little I cared for most of them. Captain Marvel is the worst - not only Brie Larson doesn't fit the role, her presense in the movie is (rightfully so) reduced to a minimum and she doesn't do anything important.The ONLY character I cared about was Nebula. Thanks to Caren Gillan's great performance and the fact that dumb jokes don't destroy her character, she was the only character I could actually relate to and was interested in her actions.Also scenes where Tony was talking to his father and Steve vs. Hydra were good as well.So where this leaves us? Well - A very sub-par movie that deals significant damage to several Marvel characters and has inconsistant plot with a few bright spots that don't allow me to drop my score to 2 or 1. This movie is awful and I don't recommend it to Marvel fans or to good movie fans.
Jokes are awful, story is bad and characters feel worse than they were before."
159,"You remember watching Last Jedi? Thinking, ""Eventually this will turn into a Star Wars movie, right?"" This movie feels the same. Huge boring disappointment."
160,"Captain marvel movie was a complete feminist propaganda movie, where Ms Marven had no weaknesses and only more power and more power and insane power with no story line weaknesses, which made the film boring.Maybe I was over hyped for avengers, I heard rumors that Captain marvel may be in it, but I had waited long enough.
The movie was just not memorable at all, but it completed a story, the final nail on the coffin was when all the avengers tried their best against the mighty Thanos only to have sarcastic captain marvel swoop in at the end and boast about how she saved other planets ( even though Thanos killed 50% of everything ) and felt earth was on the last on her todo list.
She right their could of snapped Thanos neck like a twig but wanted to make the other avengers feel special as she jetted up and threw her self into battle cruisers like a asteroid. Basically if the avengers would of stayed at home and had Shwama eventally Captain Marvel would of sorted it all out with her infinite power.
I felt the rest of the cast were like police officers in a Hero hostage situation, she fly's down pats them on the back and says "" Hey your doing a good job "" only to fly up and handle everything."
161,"I feel they ran out of ideas, and BANG time machine is the solution. They should have prepared themselves for the end before that. for example in sherlock holmes "" the series"" they prepared for the season final ""the Final Problem"",, 2 seasons before it, saying words or giving hints that something is going to happen. I was really disappointed with this movie."
162,"I had no choice but to watch it to finish the sequence. The worst of all the Avengers movies. Apart from some action scenes all the rest it is pure lame dialogues and poor performances.
Purely made to make money out of a ""trendy"" public that are rating this movie high because I've never met one single person who has read the comics and like this garbage.
At least, there will be no more of this, I hope."
163,"I haven't really been a fan of many of the marvel movies but gave this one a shot given all the hype. Total waste of three hours. The time travel, plot holes and cheesy death scenes all were too confusing. These movies have consistently pandered to its audiences and this one was no different. If anything it was worse."
164,"Just couldn't not finish it. Felt like a Kardashian Endgame. glad i didn't pay, it any money. What has happened to marvel movies in general are those positive reviews bots or bought? There were less than 1/3 action. The rest were full drama, for a almost 3 hour movie doesn't seem realistic."
165,"Highlights of why it's terrible.Infinity stones control the flow of the universe and cannot be removed (sorceress supreme - endgame), I destroyed the stones (Thanos - endgame).Killing yourself while someone tries to stop you is not the other person making a sacrifice (soul stone would not be acquired)A sword cannot cut vibranium, jesus thors hammer doesn't scratch the ain't (Thanos America)Scarlet witch can easily kill Thanos so why doesn't she finish the job.The power of the gauntlet is the user can harness the power of the stones without being affected by them. (iron man and hulk would be unharmed, Thanos was only injured because he was trying to destroy them, he explains this at the start)An android linked to a cloud would know that she is and would switch off her WiFi.Someone who would contaminate 50 years of history because he misses his girlfriend is a personality trait that would prevent them being able to wield thors hammer.There are hundreds of inconsistencies compared to the established universe, if you are giving this film a ten star rating take off your rose tinted glasses."
166,"It is the worst scenario ever . How could you defeat the most powerfull character in the marvel universe as he is child ? And All of the logic errors ?? Making Infinity War :
MARVEL PARADOX:
1-In the First movie kill many important characters
2-Oh no ! we can't get money without them we have to save them !
3-Save them with silly time machine or incredible things
4-Show off them for 10 minutes .
4-Repeat"
167,"Soooooo bouring !!
called action movie ??? seriously !
it is actually a sleeping pills !"
168,One of the dullest films I've seen in a long time. The initial three quarters of the film is taken up with sentimental and tedious character development twaddle including flashbacks. It ends with 30mins of seen it all before low rent CGI action. That this can have a rating of over 8 is a testament to the serious dumbing down of our popular culture.
169,"Tone, pacing, character arcs, plot holes, emotional connect, logical depth,story, propagandas, Plot convenience, lazy writing.Overrated, overhyped cashgrab.
(Plot holes can be justified but the emotions, how one feels about it cannot) Endgame forces us to constantly think outside the box about the writing part. Infinity war is an amazing film but how did they manage to get the first one so right and the second so wrong. It looks like they were just trying to copy DC for having a dark ending but even they give a symbol of hope when Superman dies.Shame, a decade of characters development wasted.
..1. Tony has finally moved on and retired having a family, overcoming his panic attacks and anxiety realizing that he doesn't have to save the world anymore, but there you go the writers decided killing the basic true sense of his arc, putting him at the spot to sacrifice himself again like he was going to in all previous films and giving a dark terrible ending hurting every kid who grew up watching him for a decade, they could have sent him to coma like in the comics at least. Then a deliberate attempt by the writers trying to convince all that it was okay to kill him with the Tony's speech. It felt like they had to do this for the sake of continuing with phase 4 in Mcu to make more money so he had to forcefully die because this is supposed to be ending for all.* also this film is lost in itself lacking emotional depth as it is satisfactory to know that he is alive in many other alternate timelines. Whoever accepts this ending has failed to understand this character because all believe he's selfish man turning into a legend. Yes, this time he had much to loose -a daughter but still he was always selfless when it came to saving world like every other superhero in world at any given moment and he always played the sacrifice game welcoming death because he is that legend indeed.
2. Thor was already ruined enough in Ragnarok but they managed to make him a fat joke. Thor rejects the throne in Dark World so he could learn more and protect Earth. But he accepts the throne in Ragnarok because he feels ready and he needs to, also now he's in his most powerful form to rule. But in this film he rejects the throne once again and gives it to Valkyrie. We have a Hulk who doesn't get enough importance not even a minute of solo fight after he got beaten by Thanos in IW. Then comes Captain Marvel who is said to be the most powerful but doesn't get a proper combat against Thanos and gets defeated within seconds.
3. People expected that Steve Rogers will die so they made him live, here he leaves his best friend Bucky without giving him a purpose after all the journey they've been through and letting him to still be a sidekick where he doesn't get to either retire nor be the next captain as he hands over the shield to Sam. Steve decides to go away to live in the past out of nowhere and does not accept his reality though peggy asked him to move on...he could have done that starting fresh in the present and also be a responsibile support system for future Avengers, retirement done wrong.
4. Thanos who is this guy? he's not our villian who we travelled with in IW. This is just a guy who is saying that he is going to enjoy killing people. The writers here are trying their best to make him look bad with new different ideology because the audience somewhat liked him in IW. He is there for the necessity of a big bad guy in the climax.
5. The final war had one of the greatest moment in cinematic history which is the entrance of all heroes that was fun to watch because it is the basic reason- final biggest superhero team up movie which audience waited to see.
After the entrances this turned out to be the worst battle ever where it's all just action without any logic , unwanted humor and forced team up shots. This action flick concludes the ten years of storytelling with a War sequence..whole big battle episode is a disgrace to war scenes of great films where everyone in a war is supposed to be useful.-Being the so called biggest action 3-hour long comicbook event film, we come to a stage just after like 8 mins where everyone is useless without screen time and in the final setup the only one left to face against thanos is again the same Tony Stark who was willing to sacrifice himself for Nth time.-I wish to see the 14 billion ways of Doctor strange which writers failed to work on to make a better film but they chose this because whatever they make because of the hype it was destined to hit big to carry-on the franchise without stopping.A celebration turned into a tragedy."
170,"This is so not ok! It is extremely bad! On so many different levels, this is awful!"
171,Weak writing.Bad guys are bad for the sake of being bad.Too much reliance upon CGI and cute punchlines.
172,"And that's the best part of the movie ...
I had my doubts about the Russo brothers, but now I know.
Stop making movies, please ..."
173,First 30 minutes everyone is moping around couldn't hang around for another 2 & a half hours to see overpaid morons do senseless acts. I am ashamed to contribute towards this movie's box office record.PS: I am not a dumb merican who likes stupid action without a story. Disney has ruined movies no one will make quality movies anymore just idiotic superhero stuff.
174,"Endgame is a much less interesting and visually engaging movie than Infinity War. I don't understand all the crazy hype and 8.8 on imdb is stupid, this is why I'm giving it one star, to mitigate the stupidity.As everyone expected, remaining avengers use time travel to try to fix things, yet even for a marvel movie the time travel science is confusing and ridiculous, as well as shown in a very boring way. I've seen low budget movies that had better grasp on the scientific, logical and visual aspect of time travel.The whole point of endgame is to resurrect the fallen avengers and other trillions of creatures across the galaxy, yet while doing it avengers end up losing irrevocably even more important members of the team, and the whole thing looks ill-conceived.A lot of time is spent on meaningless conversations, while the devastation Thanos caused across the galaxy is barely shown, negating the past and current sacrifices of avengers.I left Infinity War wanting to see how the story ends.
I left Endgame feeling that I should've waited for it to come out on Netflix."
175,"The film begins with the aftereffects of the culling by bad guy Thanos. That's where everything starts to go wrong. According to the story, half of all life disappears in the universe. I can't speak for the universe, but I can speak for Earth when I say this is seriously overblown.Being Gen-X, I actually remember a time when the population of the planet was at 3.4 billion people. It was 1971. One of the big problems that faced us was... wait for it... overpopulation. Still, with that many people we managed to send people to the moon, create things and still, somehow, survive. All that would happen would be a drastic reduction in real estate prices, a surplus of goods and the Earth would get around four decades of time to stop the train wreck of climate change. In the Avenger Endgame, people prefer to mope and everyone has forgotten how to clean things.Instead, the Avengers get weepy. They decide to ""fix"" things through time travel. This is, believe it or not, the highlight of the film. Once they accomplish their ""time heist"" the punching begins. Then the punching continues. Then it's followed by more punching. More Avengers join in the punching. Much CGI nonsense follows. Capitan America gets a scrape on his face, the only part of him that seems susceptible to damage. Everyone carries the magic glove around while, yes, more punching follows.Finally, when they run out of punches, Iron Man snaps his fingers and it all stops. Tears are shed and the viewer is left asking why this mess couldn't take about two hours less than it did. Overall, I give it a seven for the time travel, take away three for the endless punch fest and two more for the fact that the whole thing is stupid-absurd. It's a great film to watch on a plane where you can skip through most of it."
176,"Beginning was great, ending was great, I barely stayed awake in the middle."
177,The idea of the film is there. What killed the movie overall was the writing and the poor choices made by the director. I get that they wanted to pander to the younger kids that were 12 or younger but went to ridiculous lengths to do so that killed any reason for anyone over the age of 30 to like it beyond being happy that their children liked it.
178,"What's missing from ""Endgame"" is the free play of imagination, the liberation of speculation, the meandering paths and loose ends that start in logic and lead to wonder."
179,"I have to start of by saying that i'm not the biggest Avengers fan but i really enjoyed Infinity war. I saw the movie on the new Odeon Imax theather in Oslo and i was blown away in every aspect. Not only was the 3D effects better than I had ever seen, the movie it self was awsome. I could write on and on about all the obvious reasons to why Infinity war was great one but what hit me the most was the nice pace and tempo of the movie and besides the plot worked well. Compared to Endgame which in my opinion is a very slow movie. The Avengers kept on talking and talking on and on.. and then they plotted and then they talk some more about what they where plotting. I mean the action never came. For me what makes the avengers movies good is the pace of the movies and their ability to solve problems on the go. This one didn't have that it's to stationary, to slow to whiney.
All of that though would be fine had the plot worked, but it didn't, it was to far fetched and it felt like it was rushed. They dug a hole they couldn't climbe out of. After two hours with no action i lost my patient and walked out of the theater. I'm not saying it was that bad but i just didn't feel it and i was left pretty much very dissatisfied."
180,There are so many nonsense point in this movie. Wasted my 3hrs. I'm very very DISAPPOINTED.
181,"I can never be bothered with reviews but this films rating is beyond a joke.
Plot is awkward and ridiculous... even for Marvel.
Acting is non existent. Direction and editing just feels amateurish.
I couldnt deal with anymore after the 1st hour it was excruciating.
It feels like they gave a class of children the old ""how would you end the avengers"" lesson and just put all the answers in a bag and picked one.... and then just made it work.... or so they thought.
I may feels the urge to watch the 1st half again and hope it inspires me to watch the conclusion but its highly doubtful."
182,"It was a fairly entertaining film for the first couple of hours (probably worth a 6 or 7), with a few exceptions, - not least the abomination of making Thor a fat drunken slob.
Then it slowly became apparent that this was all about shedding the old traditional heroes (as originally written) and replacing them with politically correct versions as per the recent trend.
I'm sure it will appeal to enough millennials to make tons of money, but I suspect that this is where I get off.
If the PC brigade want ethnic minority and female heroes, - why not create new ones instead of corrupting the original stories.
Until they add a White (or Black) Widower, male Captain Marvel (as per the original stories) or a white panther, etc., for balance.
Which, I'm guessing, is no time soon."
183,"This movie is so much childish. Whats wrong with you guys , i mean first thanos snap his fingers and then you guys did the same 😂
Is this some kind joke ?"
184,"A Titan approach is required to restore order back to this ridiculously high film rating....The first act is a series of cliches that does not inspire.The second act is the ever reliable and cheap device of time travel to make everything ok again.The third act is a few moments of sacrificial giving to pull on hearts strings via characters we have already grown to like.And this ladies and gents is what happens when you properly invest in a franchise, you can basically get away with a crappy grab for cash and a last hurrah.If it were not for the nostalgia and sheer enjoyment of seeing marvel characters in one fight scene this screenplay would have presented as written by high school kids.But no, we have worse, virtue signalling Hollywood types, who are in an insular sound bubble that insist that girl power must prevail on the big screen. Once again the ticket buying fans of fly over states are treated like they don't exist."
185,"After watching endgame I felt nothing special,it was completely predictable and disapointing ending, just like every superhero movie the bad guy loses and the good guys win, garbage, it was a long boring movie with the only special thing to show for it is the 45 minute long mess of horrible cgi they call a ""final battle"""
186,"I Have Watched Every Single Movie
& Every Single TV Show... This Is Awful.They Hyped This Up So Much Yet Was So"
187,"As much as we might miss some of the characters who died in Infinity war, this avengers movie was not necessary. The story ended perfectly in last movie.
I feel that this was an effort to bring back lost characters for whom most of the little boys and girls cried for in last movie... and in doing so, making tons of mistakes and dynamics change that made it near unwatchable.
As much as it upsets people, Thanos was always right. And this was just a sad attempt in making him the unreasonable bad guy... sad."
188,"Long, boring, no story, no nothing !
Long, boring, no story, no nothing !
Long, boring, no story, no nothing !"
189,"There are endles topics, the sci-fi universe could be so immensely diverse, but only the pure greed and the striving for money making lets us 1v1 with THIS.Why dont we take the top Nebula/Hugo winning scenarios? Because we obviously perceive our viewer through the prism of arrogance and dont evend dare to waste corporate budgets on something worthy.Such a waste of time, ressources and such a stamp on Marvel.Bad, just bad."
190,Godawful movie. Took itself too serious. The girlpower bit was groan out loud cringe. Fat thor pointless. Half a hulk just annoying. Ending was longer than lord of the rings. Big fight scenes awful cgi. Everything got thrown at the screen and none of it stuck
191,"Everything that could go wrong went wrong. We've had countless time travel movies before, but this one had the worst mechanics by far...and by mechanics I mean there were no mechanics whatsoever. Time travel could no whatever you wanted to as long as it helped the plot advance even if it did not make any sense and came without any consequences. 1 hour into the movie there were already so many loopholes and inconsistencies that I stopped counting. Thanos turned from a lion into a kitten (to avoid saying another word) and your typical evil character. It was so bad that it actually got me laughing when Tony Stark was dying...now that's an achievement on its own. So much time was spent around our protagonists and yet they never felt as thin as they did now. Infinity War was a much much more satisfying movie. Never thought I'd say this, but I'd rather watch Batman Vs Superman over this crap. Now all that I hope for is that it does not break Avatar's box office record or else that would be the joke of the century.
Don't get me wrong though, I still highly recommend watching it....for all those below the age of 12...because that's how immature you must be to ignore all of the movie's flaws."
192,"So many others have captured how I felt about this movie, that regurgitating what they said would lessen their impact. So all I want to say is that this movie was slow, disjointed, badly executed in writing and a complete disappointment. Even my 9 year old grandson said it sucked. Sad...."
193,"This is the worst superhero movie that I've ever seen since Avengers Infinity Wars, Captain Marvel and the reboot of Fantastic Four. All of those movies are masterpieces compared to this heaping pile of trash.The only good thing that has come out of this movie is the memes. The pacing is agonizingly slow, the story honestly doesn't make much sense at all. The fact that the Russo Brothers and Kevin Feige himself have to spoon feed you how brilliant and amazing this movie is goes to show how.bad it truly is.The characters that we all once knew and loved have now become boring, robotic sleeves to Disney. They are just there for a paycheck at this point, and boy did they get a huge one for some lackluster, boring and honestly some of the worst performances I've seen on screen in my 24 years.Get ready to see Robert Downey jr. Acts like he is in a high school play with his children, the only genuine father figure that actually seems real is Jeremy Renner in this film, otherwise it is ridiculously boring, full of potholes, and it's just a giant flashback and re-use of old footage that honestly gave them material that they should have used differently.I'd like to say that we as Marvel fan's have been strapped in a chair. We can't move, the room is dark, and then Kevin Feige and The Russo Brothers turn on the blinding lights and all walk in with spoons in their hands. They then proceed to, one by one, spoom feed us things like ""This movie is a masterpiece."" ""The reason why that didn't make sense is because we forgot to put it in."" "" We're so talented. Please waste your money on our talentless, bland films that we only make to make toys, merch and statues that people pay thousands of dollars for."" "" We haven't completely checked out and are desperate for new talent."" As you slowly lose conscience and black out.If you're looking to be in pain, by all means go and see this movie in the theater, but if you'd like to skip the boring Parts like I did, rent it on DVD. It's not worth buying nor is it worth watching more than once as some people have. To those people, I pray that your brain's get better >¤<"
194,"This latest of the Avengers series is pretty predictable because it is so formulaic: a convoluted set of story strings that must come together at the end, gratuitous little interpersonal dramas, and lots and lots of explosions, fistfights, and a pseudo battle of Armageddon. Also, predictably, the final battle must invoke Deus ex machina to save the day.It's too bad that a lot of engaging actors and Marvel characters are wasted on such an insipid, uninspiring script.The God wannbe, Thanos, is a boring and not a terribly scary sci-fi villain. He looks like a World Wrestling Federation refugee who overdosed on steroids. And, the quest for the five magic stones that give power over the entire universe sounds like a gimmick straight out of an adolescent-level video game.The first 60 minute takes forever to ramp-up. And the viewer is lost without remembering the previous installment,""Infinity War."" After a padded full three hours of superhero antics - so many superheroes I can't keep them straight - the ending is dismally anticlimactic. Killing off Iron Man seems terribly misplaced. And, just to drag out the boredom, it follows up with a painfully long shot of all the super heroes - clad in black - at a funeral that is, well, deadly.A forgettable fractured sci-fi yarn."
195,"I know the reviews say differently. But it sucked.Could have been so much better.So impossibly random that a malfunction would happen to let Thanos see the pasts future which is impossible even for superhero movie standards.Plus if you had the all powerful hand you could have controlled the event and caused your not death. Just saying.And why was it so easy to chop hand and head in one scene but then, So difficult to handle Thanos with more super power hero's at the ready??Thor fat??? Just dumb, ruined the movie for me.Part one was just so good and flowed so well."
196,"I don't mind long movies, but they should be interesting. The story of this one could have been written by any 10 year old. What are story-writers getting paid for these days?"
197,Ant man didn't even go up thanos's ass. i sat through three hours of movie and paul rudd did not go up purple alien butthole
198,"I really liked Infinity war,but endgame is so much boring.
Thor and Hulk were totally wasted.Average CGI and actions.Some dialogues felt forced and totally
unnecessary.I expected more from marvel.
The Infinity war ending was much better and epic.I will take endgame as an alternate ending"
199,"I cant believe people think this is 8.8, in a normal world this film is around 6, Infinity war is around 7, and some teenagers watch this at the cinemas and no one remembers it after a month."
200,"Watched last evening on Blu-Ray and was quite disappointed. Should have streamed it for a lot less. What in the world is going on with the writers and producers these days. Plot was weak at best. Time Paradox was poorly done. Character development bordered on the ridiculous. Thor was made into a bumbling drunk idiot, Hulk was....I don't know, some kind of a cross between Banner/Hulk working in a diner, and was nearly useless like in Infinity Wars, Captain American now has and can wields Thors' hammer. What in the world is going on! This unfortunate change started surface with Infinity Wars. They also made sure all the politically correct stuff was jammed right in there. The first two remain the best, don't even bother with the others. Sad!!"
201,"This must be one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen.
They tried to create humor, sadness but it was just pathetic."
202,"This was probably one of the worst movie I have seen, even on the Marvel scale. How can they take so many talented actors and make this non-sense? I laughed every time emotional drama came. Instead of tears, I was was feeling pity for myself. I hope this is really the endgame. But I doubt."
203,"It was a long time ago that i saw a movie this bad. It was a mix of Grease, Dirty Dancing and Star Wars combined. The endless tear-pulling scenes with heavy music and long faces. Storylines bouncing from left to right. At one point all wizards, superheros and comic heros came out of nowere to help fight the bad guy. It made no sense whatsoever. You have to be under 11 to appriacte this story. Sesame Street is a philosophical and deep story in comparison to this bad excuse for a movie."
204,Captain America switched with lokki at some point in past and captain never returned. This was more like a soap than action movie.
205,"I watch probably 1 movie on an average every week from last 3 years and have watched a lot of boring movies but this is the first time I could not watch a movie to the end
Can't be more boring movie then this"
206,I don't know what to say. Was it a movie or some kind of joke? Terrible screenplay and ridiculous performances by some ridiculous actors (of course they are not actors).Hey Russo brothers... You SUCK. Even Masoud Dehnamaki could have done better than you two farmers.I would probably likeit if I were a sheep!!!
207,"This entire movie was based on time travel, it's in the same category as Hot tub time machine. It's so awful its embarrassing."
208,One should just stop at Avengers Infinity War and not watch this stupid movie. One of the worst movies of this series.
209,"As a huge fan of marvel I can say that the characters I know and love that I expected to see in the grand finalé of a 22-movie saga, where nowhere to be found. Fat Thor was played off for jokes too much. Captain America was more Thor than actual Thor. Professor hulk was just a boring character. Thanos was nothing like how he was in the infinitely superior ""Infinity War"". Time travel rules was just cheap writing. An easy way out of a complex predicament crafted by two people with minimal creative abilities. The plot was littered with holes and just boring. This movie was not exciting. One of my biggest problems was the stupid one-liners and cheap jokes. This movie was not meant to be funny. There is room for humor, but there also needs to be room for plot and suspense and seriousness. Another of my biggest problems was cap lifting mjolnir. I have no problem with him lifting it. But it was anti-climactic. Good idea, but butchered in execution. I don't say this lightly or out of arrogance or vanity, but I, as a 15 year old kid could have created a better movie. Also, the greatest part of the film: Joe Russo got cast as the gay extra in his own movie."
210,"Seriously how did this junk made so much money is beyond me are people really crazy they don't know what they have done,this film is pure nonsense,and i hate to say this Thanos was a total looser here also what happened to hulk its a shame people will realise this in future that what a load of crap nonsense this was a total waste of time and money,it should have not even made 50 bucks at box office that's how bad this is,Scarlet Johannson was sacrificed in this mess just so people can shed a tear and throw money at the screen ,this makes me wonder the makers and people really enjoyed killing her black widow and iron man for cash ,both of them are dead now.,besides that this film is contagious cesspool of bad Cgi ,horrible cheesy Dialogs and Cartoonish action,and they say this can match avatar 2009 avatar was a masterpiece holds great repeat value then this any day,endgame holds no value as a film at all forget about repeat value,how is this a film it does not even qualifies for direct to Disc DVD Or hallmark movie,i feel like this is a bad joke its so bad that you cannot even tell it to yourself alone my rating is 1/10.skip it do not waste your time and money on this the whole world already wasted."
211,"I am huge sf lover but i never liked hollywood superhero movies except maybe (nolan batman trilogy) because there is no suspense when you know in advance who will win. would you like to watch football match knowing the result in advance?secondly i don't like this ""back to the past"" cheat card. so every time you end up dead or don't like the outcome you can go into past undo things, bring dead back to life and change the present. so basically ""endgame"" isn't the end, if ""bad"" guys also can also travel back in time? ok, i know this film targeted teenager audience and cannot be to dark or too complex (like real life is). film was fun, but it would be much better if they didn't use this lame trick going into past after half of the characters ended up dead in previous film."
212,"What a boring, predictable excuse for a movie. I'm so glad I resisted the hype and didn't suffer through this in the theaters. It's obvious this movies reviews are artificially inflated on this site, just look at all the other negative reviews."
213,"What they did to Hulk and Thor was disgusting. The best action Hulk had was handing tacos to Antman. They turned him into taco Tuesday Hulk with no redemption or rematch for Thanos.Fat alcoholic self pity Thor was not funny and for a demi god he turned out to be league bowler from crap town Ohio. Appalling and gross! Oh, support group Cap was another miss. They turned the women into men and the men into women straight up Hollywood style. 👎👎"
214,"Okay so I've loved most of the Marvel films leading up to this final phase, great, i loved Infinity War.So watching this film for the first time was okay, because the old characters coming back and so on is cool once only, after watching the film again i was really bored, like really bored until the end fight.So for me this film was literally 2 hours and 30 mins of talking and stumbling around not doing much then followed by a Infinity War style fight scene which yes was cool but nothing special for the end of this phase.But the main point i want to get across is how much was wrong with this film, there is so many things wrong, I'm not gonna sit here and type 10,000 words to bore you with so all i say is go onto YouTube or Google and lookup ""Things wrong with End Game' and i guarantee you will change your mind about this film, you will reliase that not much makes sense and you will then be sad that this film was the end.Even my friends thought it was good at first, they gave it a 10/10 but after they picked the film apart they even saw how bad it really is.Age 25 - Cinema: Stevenage iMAX 3D Double Bill Infinity War + End Game
Watch, Consider, Avoid - Watch because its a Marvel film and the last one but avoid once you have seen it once or as a stand alone film."
215,"What the?......how could i have enjoyed Infinity war so much and find this to be a bunch of total incoherent crap? leave the Time Traveling to the experts like Dr Who. I wont even go into the all the plot holes and no sense paradoxes as i'm sure many have already done but what a sad ending to a wonderful journey? and please Disney, please lay off on the Wokey preaching crap its getting tedious, lets just have a good story eh and leave the politics to the Politicians?"
216,"Terribly disappointed in the effort. There should have been something ""more"". The movie plods from scene to scene with no real tension, almost as if marvel is giving the viewer the cliff notes on the last 10 years of films. Even the end battle was snooze-worthy, including the mostly useless Captain Marvel showing up as the deus ex machina."
217,"Overwhelmingly boring!!! Thanos the farmer, really? This is a soap opera!! Don't waste your time and money watching this BAD JOKE!!"
218,"Some parts were done well, revisiting the previous films was a treat but the film overall was pretty lousy. Cap and Tony's departure were not well executed. There are several reviews already on why Cap's exit was out of character and unlikely, look them up if you don't see it. Tony, always wrong, sacrifices himself finally after a lifetime of selfishness, which is a heroic exit in a way, but was a pretty lame ending for such an important character. The movie relies HEAVILY on trying to pull viewer's heartstrings vice have decent writing and make sense in many ways. The SJW nonsense has been out of control in these movies as well for sometime now, more prevalent in the agents of shield series though tbh. Time for Disney to let it go."
219,"You really think this movie is one of the greatest movies all-time? Better than Forrest Gump, Inception, and The Matrix? You must be joking!!"
220,"They cant kill the main charectors, just learn from got."
221,"With exception of handful actors play and CGI, this movie lacks in all aspects, thus making it outright pointless."
222,"Worst movie i saw this year boring mess,plot holes,too cheesy,bad writing"
223,Watch it honestly. My 5th grade sexual harassment class had more relevance then this. And I made the mistake of buying it.
224,"So so disappointing... I am speechless, boring, stupid... All i was doing is watching how much is left till the end of the movie..."
225,"I didn't think this was politically correct enough. Captain Marvel is my favourite MCU character and It caused me great pain when the lovely Captain Marvel was brutally punched by the savage beast known as Thanos. I was overwhelmed with a great urge to help her like a heroic chivalrous knight but unfortunately as I sat there watching it on the screen in the cinema and knowing it wasn't exactly real, I knew I couldn't do anything about it and the second I realised that I burst into tears crying. If only I had the power to transport myself to fictional films I would've helped her out. I also thought the effects were terrible for a film with a $250 million plus budget and I felt Thor's alcoholism was inappropriate for a film that's watched by many children."
226,"Too much whining! No coherency! Completely convoluted theory about time travelling.
I thought they would make something great but what the hell was that!"
227,"Absolute deconstruction of original characters and the universe, this nonsensical circus seems only aiming to cram as much ""political correctness"", painful attempts at humor and cheap pathos into torturous 3 hours.
One can only wish for infinity gauntlet to snap away the bad acting, horrible scenario and hollywood itself."
228,I am literally 3 hours closer to the grave with nothing of note to show for it.
229,"This is by far the worst MCU movie I've ever seen. Ever.I was looking forward to it after last year's Infinity War, to see how they would bounce back from that Thanos snap. But boy, was I disappointed. The whole ""time heist"" plot is tortuously senseless, it lacks any form of intelligence from any aspect, be it scientific or imaginative. What kind of ""writers"" are responsible for this? Or what were they on while ""writing"" this? The quick one-liners, barbs and quips are cringe-worthy and so are the ""comedic"" situations.One can objectively agree that the movie is way too long and boring for the first two hours, even my 11 yo super-fan brother thought so. It offers very little entertainment. The plot is too incoherent for any sensible adults and very complex to follow for the young ones so they just eagerly await the battle finale. Which does arrive at the end in the form of a badly choreographed CGI bukake scene with pyrotechnics and many, many cuts for anyone to follow what the heck is going on.Massive, glaring plot-holes abound from start to finish which I bet are invisible to the throngs of fanboys all over the world over-hyping and claiming this piece of hot, leaky garbage to be the greatest movie ever made. Along with giving it over the top reviews and ratings.Can't believe this is what sells to the masses and makes studios billions of dollars now. Makes me lose all hope in future superhero movies. I couldn't wait for it to get over and go home. A complete waste of time."
230,Not sure about the rave reviews. But was a huge let down. It felt as if they just wanted to end the series . Infinity war could have been a better ending. Lot of flaws on time travel theory as well.
231,"First off, phenomenal cast. I can't think of another movie that had even half the headlining talent that this one did. Still, it just plain sucked. Terrible dialogue, boring and repetitive special effects, and longer than Gone with the Wind.Also, I detest Gweneth Paltrow. I'd have given a 2nd star if they'd killed her, but they didn't so I didn't."
232,"I'm a huge fan of the MCU, and honestly, I think I've watched Infinity War over 20 times prior to watching Endgame. I had high expectations for the sequel, and actually thought it would be deeper than it turned out to be. Endgame is intricate, yes. But intricately shallow. Here are some things I thought would happen but didn't. First of all, I counted on every line in Infinity War, thinking it would imply something greater in Endgame.Example 1:
When Thanos asked Red Skull ""Where is the Soul Stone?"", Red Skull responded, ""You should know, it extracts a terrible price."" Thanos replied with ""I am prepared,"" and Red Skull said, ""We all think that at first. We are all wrong.""This led me to think that perhaps in Endgame, Thanos regrets his decision to kill Gamora, and somehow the stone would turn on him or doesn't work the way it should because what he did to her was not really love. He selfishly sacrificed her, and true love is putting someone else's needs before your own. Although this part is sort of redeemed in Endgame when Nat sacrificed herself for Clint (to contrast what Thanos did to Gamora), Endgame still should have shown how Thanos was ""wrong"" in thinking that he could let Gamora go if he did truly love her. Doing so would have also added another facet his character. However, in Endgame, Thanos was not the same as he was in Infinity War. He had no conviction and became even more ruthless in his avenging.Example 2:
Dr. Strange told Tony Stark ""We're in the endgame now"" and ""there was no other way"" right before he turned to dust.I had high hopes for Dr. Strange and his creative problem-solving skills in Endgame. I thought he had perhaps sent the time stone to the past or future to do some ""work"" prior to handing it over to Thanos. But nope, there was nothing. He handed over the actual stone. There was no manipulation of it. There was also no game plan. Dr. Strange HAD NO PLAN! He basically saw his 14+ million possible outcomes that they would win by some stroke of luck, and bet everything on that one chance (which was a mouse hitting some switches in Ant-Man's time machine van). Wouldn't it have been more intricate if he had sent the stone to the past or future to tamper with time, or to somehow orchestrate events in a way where their winning was more premeditated and planned, than merely by some stroke of luck or some random chance?Example 3
In Infinity War, when Vision offered to die to save half the universe, Captain American told him, ""We don't trade lives Vision"", and Vision said, ""Captain, 70 years ago you laid down your life to save how many millions of people, tell me why is this any different.""I thought Captain America would be the one who would sacrifice himself in Endgame, perhaps the one to undo the snap. He was the one who previously laid down his life for millions and perhaps he should have done it in Endgame.
I'm bummed about a few other things. I couldn't relate to the characters as much as I did in Infinity War. Endgame's characters' interactions felt more scripted and robotic.I wasn't convinced that Morgan was Pepper's daughter. I didn't sense that connection between them. There was no scene of Pepper tending to Morgan in the movie, except for the end when she held Morgan at Tony's funeral. I didn't feel sad at Tony's funeral. Nobody cried there. Yes, he was a true hero, but there should have been some tears. Maybe they all saw that his death was unpreventable, but still, the loss didn't seem emotionally impactful (to me).I really did not like what they did to Thor in Endgame. They stripped him of his dignity. I thought maybe they would redeem him by the movie's end, but they didn't. He was still fat and no longer desired to lead Asgard. Back on the alcoholism road, maybe? Thor also had both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker in Endgame, yet he couldn't even strike Thanos (who had no stones to empower him this time).The melding of Banner and Hulk was underwhelming. It was Hulk's extremity that made him The Hulk. Banner-Hulk may seem like ""the best of both worlds,"" but it made the character too palatable, too compromised, and not exciting or powerful. He wasn't a strong fighter like the Hulk, and he just looked like a green Thanos with glasses. There should have been a Hulk and Thanos rematch to redeem the Hulk at least!Also, how did Captain Marvel come in just the right time at the beginning and the end to help save the day? That end-credit scene in Captain Marvel where she comes back asking ""Where's Fury?"" should have been included in this movie. I also think she should have been included MORE in this movie if she is to be considered an Avenger and a part of the team.And the ending...how did Captain America age after living a ""normal"" life with Peggy? And even if they did marry, wouldn't he still have looked only 40 years old after she had grown old and died? And what if they had kids? Wouldn't their kids run into Peggy's original kids with her previous husband? Confusing and just odd.There were a LOT of superheroes in this movie (especially when the snap was reversed), but they all felt like strangers to me. I could not connect with them, perhaps because there was only so much that could be jam packed in 3 hours.All in all, I thought the movie was good because it was still complex. I loved the action scenes and I enjoyed seeing some characters rekindling with loved ones from their past. However, this movie did fall short in quite a few areas and just wasn't as deep as I had hoped it would be. The time traveling had its own plot holes, and I truly miss Vision and the 2018 Gamora.I think Infinity War was the better movie. Endgame, by itself, was a good standalone movie, but it wasn't well executed as Infinity War's sequel. Even though Infinity War and Endgame had the same sets of writers and directors, it didn't feel that way. The pacing, plot progression, and division of screen time for actors were handled more aptly in Infinity War, in my opinion."
233,"Poor cgi for big budget movie! Nothing special in acting, regular things... Copy story from other movies like Inception and Star Trek.. Poor cinematography and soundtrack! General nothing special, nothing unique!"
234,"What have they done wrong with this movie ""everything""
They have turned Thor & Hulk into joke characters the whole movie feels hurried and confusing the CGI is poor on more than one occasion a lot of MCU characters are more cameos than necessary.I enjoyed the early Marvel movies but the most recent ones are ruining the franchise how they made so much £££ out of this is baffling it only gets more confusing the longer you watch it.I am not sure why so many cameos were necessary as Captain Marvel was all that was needed."
235,"I have nothing to say except this movie is overrated and the only reason why people went to it was because, Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger."
236,"Seriously time travel?! You did the lazy way to kill thanos ,am so furious. That's why infinity war was better 10x"
237,"Endgame is the worst superhero movie I've seen, it's full of lazy bad writing, this is a shame to cinema, endgame was a disapointing predictable end to a mediocre franchise"
238,"I mean not sure why these films get rated so high! getting almost 9/10 for a film which is a 7/10 at best. Didn't even finish watching all the film, are we really saying this film is on par with LOTR, Inception etc.."
239,"Endgame, The Flash (TV Series), and Legends of Tomorrow (TV Series) has many similarities and that bothers me the most. Felt like they stolen the idea & concept of time travel directly from The Flash story line. A big fan of Infinity War. It had original ideas and it was well executed. But I cannot say the same for Endgame.My Rating 6/10"
240,"I hate how people are saying that this movie is epic, and that all the movies that preceded it were epic as well. There have only been a handful of Marvel movies that have actually been good, and this is not one of them.Marvel, like The Simpsons, has run out of ideas and is now running off of a therom. If it has the word marvel in it, then it will sell. The story does not matter only the name, and it's finally starting to show, as it has for The Simpsons for years now. And the announcement of new movies is now no longer exciting for me.Marvel honestly needs to take a step back and take their time in producing movies, as well as shows now too, like some of their most fantastic movies and shows, like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, Ant-Man, and even the Netflix Daredevil, which was surprisingly good and did a great job portraying the character. What the executives at Marvel don't seem to understand is that they in fact are not Epic, they're just putting trash out and unfortunately the masses are gobbling it up. Things become like goats, they'll eat anything that you put in front of them.End game is one of the most unimpressive movies I've seen in a very long time. I cannot believe that I wasted almost four hours of my life watching this horrible, sad excuse for a superhero movie, if you could even call it that. The only great thing about the past few Marvel movies is the memes that have come out of it. The Russo Brothers Legacy will be the memes that were made from their movies, not the story itself nor the movies. Just because you have the lucasfilm lighting, as well as the CGI company behind you does not make you amazing. What makes anything amazing, story-wise is a good story. End game doesn't even have that! They paid Robert Downey jr. 75 million dollars for the only good scene in the entire film, and it only lasts a couple of seconds. What a waste of money.For the love of God stop going to see Marvel movies and teach them a lesson to stop making horrible movies they aren't even superhero movies anymore. Stan Lee is gone, even when he was alive he didn't stop these terrible movies from being made, because he believed in Marvel and that it could change the world. In the beginning it did, with the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man's, Iron Man, and all of these amazing Marvel films that were actually well done and good. Stan Lee near the end, just produced these films because that's all that he knew to do. He inherently trusted these people to make great movies, and honestly they failed him and failed the original image of Marvel. Only the comics have stayed true, and even then they've come to PC for my liking, and it's so sad. Marvel won't be getting any more of my money. Hopefully you won't be giving any of yours to them anymore either. I am tired"
241,"I give this movie 1 because of course lower this rating and should lower and be under infinity war.
The end is good but the kill of thanos in the beginning is so bad and get another thanos form another time line i think the main villan is just replace to another and many thing like black widow can't back because it in another time line but we see this green female back??
And when they back in time the director don't give as a master peace if they ask Christopher to help them they film will be like a bomb"
242,"Please don't waste your time with this one. This movie was the worst, most cringeworthy waste of a good story I have ever seen."
243,"What can I say but WOW! This has to be one of the most boring movies that I have ever seen in my life. I loved Infinity War but Endgame on the other hand is utter trash. Way too many fanboys overlooking major plot holes.
Personally I would give it around a 6. However, seeing how many people are giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1."
244,"Can't believe how long this film was, it was far too long and far too spread out. The characters were overly simplistic and there was too much action scenes for the characters to really develop and show off their personalities. After the film I could barely get up it really made me and my lovely Mother's backsides very sore after sitting down for over 3 hours at once. Not only is this film immensely overrated but it hurts people's bums as well!"
245,"Boring. Slow. Badly written, poor story.... worst of a bad bunch"
246,"This is a movie where one term could be used to describe it, and that term is ""tedium."" I've always had a begrudging attitude towards Avengers movies because, as with a lot of entries in the MCU, it's a lot of scientific nonsense with the action thrown in as an afterthought in order to justify its existence as a superhero movie. But I thought I would give Endgame a fair chance. After all, having all those superheroes on one screen should be fun, action packed, and entertaining, right? Wrong.I cannot express how terrible this film was. The two redeemable parts were Tony Stark's daughter and Ant-Man. They were the only entertaining parts of the film. I pay money to see movies that are entertaining, not ones that are so full of characters that you get lost.There are a lot of reasons that I hated this movie, but I'm going to focus on two in particular here: the story and the action, or rather, the lack of action. First, the story. This entire film was built around a needlessly complicated plot surrounding time travel, even though the time travel was completely pointless in the first place. Bruce Banner says, point blank, that traveling back into the past won't change the future. So, why do you do it, then? Why on Earth would you commit to such an exercise in complete futility? I'll tell you why, because you need more science fodder for all the Marvel super fans, so that they can leave the theater and point at someone who looks confused and feel superior.Everything was poorly written in this movie. When your forced obscenities are being spouted from the mouths of the people you're supposed to cheer for, while your villain speaks in Shakespearean soliloquies, then you've clearly gone completely wrong with your script. Also, the part where Stark's daughter swears and we were supposed to find it cute? Yeah, I didn't. I found it grossly inappropriate and wrong to show a 4 or 5 year old child in such a manner. It wasn't innocent and sweet, it was rather demented. Meanwhile, Thanos speaks in these long, grandiloquent speeches that never seem to have an end. It was all just one big pile of dreck.Thanos was another problem I had with this film. His motivations were never properly spelled out. They tried, but they failed rather miserably. It seemed like he just wanted to destroy the world because it was ripe for the taking, I guess? I don't know. He was weird as well, because he said he was going to build another universe, but he seemed to have a nihilistic outlook on everything, so that would mean his other universe would be completely pointless. Anyway, it was really terrible.But this movie's main sin was its lack of action through the first two-thirds, and the fact that it hardly showed the Avengers doing anything heroic. They never stopped a bank robbery, they never helped an assault victim, all they did was do their pointless time travel stuff to attempt to stop Thanos, even though Bruce said it would be completely futile to do so. The movie couldn't get out of its own way and it suffered because of it.Then the last third was all action and it blew my mind, but not in a good way. I left the theater with a physical headache due to the poor pacing and cinematography on the final battle sequences. They were overly long, started and stopped way too many times, and attempted to tie up every loose end from the entire MCU in one big bang. It was just terrible! You have to allow things to flow, and this movie didn't flow at all.A movie that was boring, poorly paced, poorly written, and just a terrible excuse for film definitely deserves a spot on my worst of 2019 list. Hopefully, Toy Story 4 makes up for it!"
247,It was extremely disappointing. Crammed every politically correct them down your throat.
248,"Okay so much wrong with this movie. I can only give it 3 stars.Why is Thanos so strong even without the stones? So many hero's get stupidly underplayed in this movie (Spiderman, Captain Marvel etc).Meh I had high hopes, but instead we got a huge mess of a movie."
249,"There's absolutely no pay off to be had plot wise here. Nothing to see here people. Fast forward through to the last hour and you're good. You will have missed nothing.This movie was either way too long or just nowhere near long enough. This was supposed to be a part II of conclusion that wraps up an entire universe of characters spanning 20 movies and they couldn't be arsed to give us a third act?Unfortunately, they titled the movie Avengers: Endgame, and making a sequel to that would be nearly as bad as having a movie titled Rambo: First Blood Part II. What would they have called a third movie? Avengers: The Really Real End Time, Place, Realm. (No, we honestly mean it this time.)Sadly, the first hour or so of the movie is Ant Man trying to save a tacked on, marketing driven first act that pays off in no way. Meanwhile, also tied to marketing, some major plot holes and omissions were completely egregious.A large portion of the principle photography for this movie was done alongside side Infinity Wars itself, which would've made sense if they'd had a coherent story line by then.Leave it to the screenwriters, they'll make something of it. Leave it to the editors, they'll fix it in post. Well, somebody forgot to fix it. And it wasn't me. Fortunately, marketing fixes everything.Let's face it, there are two kinds of people in this world: those who for a final movie who are just going to love it no matter what, those who view the movie with the same critical eye they would the others, and those who decide that there can only be two types of people.Why are there always two kinds of people? Look at Loki! Now that's an interesting character. He can be good; he can be bad. He's fiendish and lovable. He's a hero and a villain and an anti-hero and-still, somehow-human, god, and ice thing.Honestly, Infinity Wars couldn't have come at a worse time. It was originally a much larger unification of Marvel heroes and villains, and now that Disney owns all of the other Marvel Universe crap, that movie could've been the Infinity Wars, with a plot that started to wrap up before the last movie.Ah well, maybe in 20 years they'll redo the whole thing again with the X-Men and Silver Surfer in it (take or leave the Fan-4. This is super likely.I heard Spider Man: Far From Home was really really good, but I have no desire to see it. Why? Because it sounds to me like Spider Man visits France for Holiday and Meets some Good Guys and some Bad Guys and forces you to watch the credits so you can see 30 seconds that tease you into watching the next movie that's just going to do the same thing."
250,"Garbage.Only child and stupid people will like this movie.I wanted 3hours of action but instead I got 2 and a half hours of talking and 31 minutes of cool stuff.Moat boring movie of the 21st century,. The CGI characters look like they were animated with the gunk under people's toenails.I fell asleep halfway through and when I went home I just watched Howard the Duck on my phone,which is a much better movie you should watch instead.This film sucks and is an insult to ppl' intelligence.3/10"
251,"I watch all films with an open mind and went into this 3 hour long film without any preconceptions.This film really let itself down. The writers completely changed some of the characters, they tried to make it funny and failed at every attempt where it was cringe worthy and boring. The story was dragged out to its limit and went on for way to long.Don't waste your money at the cinema, maybe Google the outcome."
252,"I am a huge Marvel fan and have loved the previous Avengers films so went with high Hope's for this, unfortunately I was disappointed beyond belief. Long, slow, dull scences make up most of the movie with only about 10 minutes of actual action. Main characters are sidetracked for less popular ones and the whole film moves at a snail's pace. It really felt like they had run out of ideas and this is just a money making film. So, so let down and would not recommend.. recommend it to anyone"
253,"Absolutely awful. No cohesion, no real story, no substance whatsoever, perhaps the score might give it one point? Utter garbage. Story pathetic that at times the actors were looking embay"
254,Just some super heroes whining the whole movie. Such an example!
255,"Spoiler alert, so read at your own risk.
I though the latest title couldn't get much worse, until I watched Endgame.
Again, a movie that looks like a computer game, this time since the script failed to innovate, it goes back to the previous movies ""Back to the future"" style.
A fat Thor playing Fortnite, a Mjornir that any bloke can use, including the strange duck face Captain ""never gets his suit right"" Strangelip.
A captain that gets old and delivers his shield to the flying ""never had an impact role"" birdie. An intelligent nerdy Hulk who lost all his grace (a green Mark Ruffalo on steroids and that's it).
The list goes on and on, starting slooooow in the beginning to end in the yet again climax of the ""playmobil-bring the action man and all the transformers"" battle in the end, with depressing results and laughable deaths.
Bring the wife and put her on an iron man suit, hell bring the smurfs, the ""useless on this flick"" Black Panther and friends, Popeye and your dog if you want.
This is trash ""cinema"" in the making. let's skeese the money-cow with poor scripting, terrible CGI and ruin every child's fantasy regarding what is what and whom is whom on the ""Marvel"" universe.
Marvel, you were sold to Disney, get ready for your next princesses, easy jokes and death of your child heroes."
256,"The whole plot in this installment of Avengers hinges on a rat that just so happens to touch a button, in a van...Also, time traveling always ruins a movie. If they can travel back to NYC to 2012, then it means that the plot we saw in this movie, already happened in the first Avengers movie in 2012... It's all too silly."
257,"I had to give this 1 star as it's not possible to give it less. Having avoided it at the Cinema because i knew it was a lost cause i finally watched it tonight......
Why does Thor have 2 functioning eyes? Having been told in Guardians of the galaxy that no one can hold an infinity stone and survive, suddenly everyone can now hold one? Where is the continuity in these films? Luckily this is the last we will ever see of this franchise! Until someone decides to do a remake as there are no original ideas anymore. J.J.Abrams you now have more films to ruin 👍🏻"
258,"Seriously I am actually convinced now that nobody in the industry knows how to write an ending. they are so focused on leaving plot opening for a possible future opportunity that they cant give a satisfying ending!
Game of thrones and the decline of Stranger things to mention a few."
259,"Cheap dialogs, non sense violence. The only thing the movie has to offer is explosions. Is it really that hard to make quality superhero movies? Look at Christopher Nolan's series of Batman movies, those are quality films. This movie is flat, it can be consumed as fast food, nothing to offer really"
260,"I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.And the ending...........sigh!"
261,"This is what happens when movies start taking themselves too seriously. What's with all the emotional drama scenes in a movie about flying hammers and talking raccoons? Why are these superheroes so weak and human? Thor the GOD of Lightning is reduced to an alcoholic pot bellied homeless man by the writers and it takes away from the potency of the character. The plot is unoriginal, lazy and uninspiring. They've run out of ideas. AVOID."
262,"The movie is just very bad writing and is an epic failure for it lacks a coherent acceptable digestible fathomable sensible reasonable story or plot .. just sucks so bad that it hurts
So much is wrong that I can't begin .. but for some reason people are lying .. even critics"
263,"Terrible movie. I have never been a big fan, of Marvel and even less of MCU, but there were several good movies within that universe.... but this one as the Infinity Gauntlet, destroyed all.... No sense to talk about, the respect of the comic source.... but Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others involved on their comic origin of the characters has to be suffering in hell seeing how their creations were terribly undermined....... but just analizing from a cinematographic point of view, this film has a terrible argument, script, direction and very poor characters.... 2 hours of the film were not needed, and all the structure that were builded for this collapsed with this ending. Plot holes and nonsense everywhere.This film represents what social media can do.... in a bad way. Stay away, if you can."
264,"How did they get this so wrong?Absolute travesty, and possibly the most disappointed I've ever been with a movie.Lately disappointment is a recurring theme, with a string of average or outright terrible ""blockbusters""."
265,"I can't believe we just sat and watched this movie. There are a million different problems with this movie. Be advised we have watched all of the other Marvel movies, and have begun watching them over again with our children, and we feel totally disappointed with this last installment. I could go on forever on how it doesn't make any sense and is so disjointed... Spoilers ahead.
1. Why were there no paradoxes with the amount of interaction Thor had with his mom, Tony Stark had with his dad, and Captain America had with himself? Even Nebula met herself and then killed herself...Why didn't it impact or change anything in the future?
2. How come Tony Starks' daughter still exists if Thanos didn't get a chance to kill everyone in the first place? Wouldn't that negate the other off shoot time period?
3. How come Gamora was alive for a moment,(she lost her life due to Thanos in Infinity War) but Black Widow (who lost her life as a part of the same ritual)was dead dead? Never to return again?Other troubles:4. How come selfish Hawkeye gets a happy ending with his family after he killed his friend, and also went on a killing rampage prior to getting everything back?
5. Why did they ruin Thor and Hulk? They made Hulk the ""smart hulk"". He was straight up annoying. Thor was plain out childish. Why does the chosen ruler of Asgard, choose not to rule Asgard, and instead gives the job to Valkyrie, if not to merely push the feminine agenda and female power movement we are currently in?
6. Why did they make all the females go up against the army, alone at one point during the battle without males? Again, it felt like a commercial.
7. Assuming Captain America stayed in the past implies that there are two Captain America's in that same timeline. Eventually, it would cross over to the time when Captain America unfreezes. This would imply he is living his life in secret with Agent Carter, but then that doesn't make sense, because the old Captain America ends up on that bench in the ending timeline in an old man's jacket.
8. How come Captain Marvel doesn't age? She has been the same age since the 1990's. This wasn't explained in the movie. Although not a big concern, but something to note.
9. How come all the characters had no depth to them whatsoever, even those we have come to know and love? They were all one note and disjointed. None of them acted in the same way they had in previous movies.
There are many more plot holes and disappointing elements, but these are the ones that primarily stood out. I realize it has been explained away by saying there are multiple timelines, however the multiple timelines argument, will not give me back the three hours we wasted by watching this movie. We really hoped it would get better as time went on, only to find out it was about to get worse. So disappointing!! A big let down."
266,It was really bad. Incredibly slow. The plot was full of holes and they pretty much destroyed some of the best characters ever.Just a really bad movie.
267,"There is no way there can be so many legit 10 votes for the movie. Seems like a hoax to me.It was so bad. Infinity war was way better.I went to see it partly because of the high rating, never trusting imdb ratings again. The studio must have fixed some high ratings to induce ticket sales.Massive waste of time and money."
268,"This is the saddest review I have ever had to write. After the culmination of all the films and the Snap at the end of Avengers Infinity Wars they blew it. Fat Thor was funny for about 5 minutes then was just annoying, the Hulk was reduced to a joke quite frankly with none of his anger just stupid glasses. Most of the characters didn't get a look an and the first half of the film was just annoying. When the final fight does happen it is so unrealistic, with characters having bonding sessions as aliens and superheros were fighting all around them. Captain Marvel was in the film for about 10 seconds and destroyed the aliens so easily she made the rest of the characters redundant.
If the Russo Brothers had spent less time trying to get their friends and family cameo roles and more time trying to make the film we deserved it would have been a good thing. I am so disappointed in this movie it has left me heartbroken at the untimely end to what was one of my favorite film series ever.
It is a mess, the time travel was nonsensical, action was limited and the trademark humor was missing.
I have no idea what the writers and directors were thinking.
Oh and Iron Man dies"
269,"It was normal movie but captain marvel ruined it. She was, very overpowered and she was strongest character. Adding her in this movie was very big mistake plot was coll tho but it wqs ruined by capitan marvel"
270,"Horrible movie. Boring and poorly written. I don't understand the high rating or the hype. I didn't even finish watching it because it was so awful. I love all of the Marvel movies, but this one was unwatchable. What a waste of a perfectly good Saturday night."
271,"1;2...Terrible!
Scrap the whole thing...try again!"
272,"OMG! What have I just watched? Remake of Avengers: Infinity War?The last installment of Avengers looks like another Infinity War with table turning (this time we won) and introduction of few new elements such as Captain Marvel, Ant-Man and time machine. The rest is pretty much the same: whole lot of super-heroes doing crash-smash-flash-zap-bang super-fictional thing we already seen in earlier Avengers. OK, have to admit CGI is awesome but if you strip that the result is below average movie to watch once and leave in archive (if you mistakenly bought disc).Bottom line, I really don't see End Game as a ""Masterpiece"" just because it filled-up box office emerging on top of all movies. It is not something we have not seen before, no breakthrough, not better than Infinity War. Just good advertising boosted this up on hall of fame scale."
273,Love most of the marvel movies so far (except captain marvel) but this was a total let down :(
274,"I was not impressed.
Save your money and time.
Wait till they show this in Netflix
John Wick 3 should have been in this film and story line could have been way better!"
275,I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.
276,"What a waste of time. I am so sorry for all the Thor & Hulk fans. I really am. Movie makers played everyone for fools with all the hype. Lord of the Rings and Avatar remains my all time favorite. My advice to all those who havent watched the movie yet, please do yourself a favor and wait for the DVD. It is highly likely that you will feel wasted like me, so at least you will have saved the money."
277,"What a crying shame that a movie that had so many people awaiting its arrival delivered so little. And, it seemed to take forever to deliver that!I believe that this is one of the most critical reviews I have ever given and believe me, I firmly believe that it is wholly because my expectations were set so high by the franchise that it was pretty much doomed unless it was mind blowingly good.If the story had had one thread of; 'that was believable' or even an odd; 'that could work' it may have been able to recover but, it doesn't. It doesn't even have a; 'that was cool' at any point either!It's actually so boring I had finally found a movie I could replenish concessions during and didn't feel like I had missed anything. The reality is that I probably missed some really critical parts but it didn't matter, the movie had lost me long since then.The entire story was so convoluted that it was just plain terrible. The basic thread was non existent and I agree with many other reviewers that certain characters were pointless.Synopsis: Infinity wars was mediocre, this isn't. Also, personally, it has done so much harm to the franchise, I for one won't be bothering to spend the 'sizeable' costs involved in cinema excursions for any Avenger related future offering again."
278,"-spoilers!--Iron man had to go talk to his dad in the past, Thor had to talk to his mom, Hawkeye got to go see his old dead girlfriend.. How convenient that all the stones were in the past directly next to the main characters loved ones. Nobody had to go hundreds of years in the past or anything? Nope all the stones were just a generation away hanging out with your parents so you could go reconnect with them and get emotional.-Tons of plot holes with time travel. We were told it creates a split in the timeline when they time travel, creating a whole new timeline. Sooo.. What happened to the old timeline they left behind to go back in time to defeat Thanos? Does this mean there is a timeline where all the superheroes abandoned the world to go back in time? And at the end when Captain America went back in time, shouldn't it have created a new timeline for him as well? Instead of him being able to meet up with them when he was old? Although this doesn't bother me as much as the other point of this review, it did make the story feel a little hollow and vague.-Felt like there was only 1 single battle sequence in this movie. Aren't there usually a few smaller battles before the final epic one? It was like 2.5 hours of drama and feelings and ""oh I miss my mom"" and only about 12 minutes of good fighting. The fighting was also so cut up, trying to give every hero a great cameo, that no fight scene lasted longer than 10 seconds without being cut. Even after Iron man gives Thanos a long pre-fight speech it only shows about 2 seconds of fighting before they cut away.-They kill Thanos in the beginning super easily, no effort, kinda upsetting. This made the entire previous movie feel like a waste. (even though it was a much better movie)-The Hulk made me cringe. They've changed his character so drastically he's not even the hulk anymore. He doesn't get angry, he doesn't regenerate (either does Captain in this movie), he doesn't smash. He's always in green form. They explain all of the above with, oh I shot myself with some gamma rays. THEN LATER WHEN HE PUTS ON THE GLOVE THEY SAY THE HULK IS PRETTY MUCH IMMUNE TO GAMMA RAYS?! Ugh. He also mentions how he was trying to fight the hulk, but then he realized the hulk is the cure. What is he the cure to if he cant regenerate anymore? I miss the old Edward Norton Hulk to be completely honest.-Personally, I hated Captain Marvel. I hate the actor, I hate the character, I hate her vague god like powers, I hate how she randomly shows up in this movie even though she wasn't in any of the others. I hate how she only shows up for a few minutes in the beginning and a few seconds at the end.-Literally the best scene in the movie is at the very end, when Thor and StarLord are arguing about who's in charge of the ship."
279,"Mild spoilers ahead:
This movie could lose some 60 minutes and nobody would notice (or probably will - it would be more fun). Some great acting wasted. Exponential comic absurdity mixed with cheap philosophy. SFX could be much better for such an epic attempt. Weepy ending with forced pathos ruins everything. I was truly glad when it finally was over. 3 stars for wrapping this up, hopefully for good."
280,"What's this dribble, there's about 30 minutes of action and it's a predictable boring at that and overall mind numbing silly movie , all but this one are okay , what agenda are the feminists pushing as they try going woke and ending up broke. Shame ,hope you downloaded it and were not shammed out of any money to watch..."
281,"Well if I went back in time and told my 14 year old self about this film as she watched the first Iron Man...well she would have been disappointed. This was a horrible, boring film. Waited this long for the film equivalent of a root canal, painful, boring, and way overpriced. Don't feel ashamed if you didn't like this ""film"""
282,"Acting extremely sub-par, terrible story, and a cheap piece of non directional fan service."
283,"Avengers: Endgame is not a good movie. In fact, even when you like the Avengers, there are far better options to watch than this one, for example Infinity War.
Endgame has lot of boring and cringy scenes, you really need to force yourself to watch it without skipping parts of it.
Especially the fact that these ""Superheroes"" are still crying every day after Thanos snap and cant build up a life again was annoying af."
284,"The previous episode was , ad least entertaining ...this one is just SO boring and sometimes so depressing ...3 hours trying not to yawn and more difficult , not to fall asleep ( Hopefully the fluctuation of the sound level between dialog scene and action one help me not to ! )PS : there's a good new , though , it's supposed to be the last one !"
285,Tbh its one of the most overrated movies because of these fanboys. You shouldnt even waste your time at the cinemas.
286,I can't believe this movie has as high a rating as it does. This movie was so slow! It was more a drama then an action movie. You just had sad characters crying for the first two hours.And don't get me started on the time travel paradoxes. Time travel stories are for simpletons that can't write anything good.
287,"1- Time machine = insane amount of plot holes
2- Unrealistic overpowered Thanos without the gems... illogical AF.
3- Characters decisions specially in Thanos combat were dump and had no logic.
4- Weak plot, it seems like the avenguers didn't learn anything from the past movies.
5- Too much forced drama and fillers.
For me it´s a 5 star movie, but i gave 1 due the immense amount of 10´s."
288,"I'm going to make a leap here, just to leep things simple. The cumulative effect of so called ""super heroes"" is to the true film fan what the white man was to Native Americans: End of life as they knew it. There are 25 actors in this, and it's really sad to see them become prostitutes, like their studios. Why do you think great actors and directors wouldn't be caught dead in these cartoon films? Because they are the antithesis to great film making. Its really sad. I understand my 13 year old daughter seeing something like this. I don't understand older, more mature people acting like these are real films becauseT they arent. They are like the cartoons you woukd watch, before the main attraction started. They all have been dumbed down for the masses to the same exact plot: Good versus Evil; always. I wouldn't, no couldn't; sit through 15 minute of this pablum, not even if you paid me a year's salary to watch. It""s woeful trash, and is ruining the film industry. Stanley Kubrick the master of all the great directors, is rolling over in his grave. You won't see the top directors making any of this trash. People like Abel Ferrara, Marty Scorcese, Ridley Scott, William Friedkin, Spike Lee, or Denis Villeneuve go near a movie such as this. Its all publicity! All you hear about is how much money is made in the opening weeks, but nothing about what the films are like. It makes me sick. I would rather have my teeth drilled without novacaine than watch this. The same goes for the best actors. No way you will see ever see people like Bobby DeNiro, Christopher Walken, Matt Damon, Colin Farrell, Ethan Hawke, Nicole Kidman, or Al Pacino in any of these movies. I understand completely. It's simple. They have integrity! Skip this woeful hyped up trash and go see a real film; not a cartoon."
289,"A country desperate to sell itself as a hero, together with current propaganda of misplaced feminism and diversity, Avengers is a shallow cliché that won't be enjoyed by anybody 25 years in the future. And yet here we are, selling confusion to adolescents, regardless their age. Tell me if that slap Gamora (female) gives to StarLord (male) would be nearly acceptable if it has been the other way around? Layers of unethical messages and contradictions that go straight to the midbrain. Unfortunate script for many good actors that participated in this super production designed for super degeneration."
290,"A box office success, sure, not based on its merits though but rather that of its predecessors. Visually spectacular as we've come to expect from the Avengers franchise (and the only reason for the stars) otherwise unnecessarily long, bordering on boring and full of plot holes. A few endearing scenes and one major scene were the only semi-redeeming factors. Otherwise just SO SO disappointing **SOB**"
291,A good movie for 12 years old kids! Super heroic movies don't belong in top 250 unless they're Nolan's dark Knight or philipses Joker. Marvel uses politics to win just like all other over-rated movies we're seeing these days. Cheers to the pure old cinema.
292,"This movie was horrendous - it seems like the script was written by a 10 year old. The humor was terrible and the story was fragmented. Really don't understand how people are rating this so high. Maybe another movie, Idiocracy, explains it all - people are just satisfied by dumber crap."
293,"It's long winded...easily could be half the 3 hours.... Superhero movies are about battles and heroes...not crying and moaning. Watching iron Man wimper off was such a let down. After watching every avenger movie, I am so disappointed. Only 1 good battle, and it's over too quickly. So so so disappointed...I'd take any other avenger movie over this one."
294,What is this garbage? 3 hours of absolutely nothing but awful dialogue and boring misplaced fight scenes. Must be all the brainwashed Marvel fanboys who gave this movie a top rating...
295,Endgame was hands down the worst entry in the Marvel cinematic universe. I've had random bouts of depression ever since i saw this film. It ruined so many of the films that preceded it i have no words. Zero stars if i could.
296,"They ruined all the great superhero in this movieThe hullk??? -Wtf its a joke
Ironman- not great fight scene and usless death
Thor -is like crying baby
Captian america -can hold thor hammer??? Really??
Its like the ending of game of the throne"
297,"Don't trust the highest scores, trust the bad review. It's waste three hours film and bad storyline (not make any sense and confused). I don't understand why people likes it, I didn't cry or laugh but felt sleepy.Here are the few things that I don't like the movie
1. Too many superheroes against baby Thanos.
2. Timeline - That is cheating and all the superheroes stills lose.
3. It's not an action film, it more likes drama/sci-fi film.
4. Natasha (black widow) didn't have to die, she should uses Red skull.
5. Thor and Hulk are lazy and they are no need to be in the film and possibly the other superheroes.
6. What is Rocket doing? Why did he need to travel in time?
7. Ironman didn't have to put the glove on but use the remote control to snap the finger.I can't think of what else to write here but if you want to watch this, it's better to wait for rental dvd/digital to save your money."
298,A visually spectacular train wreckVisually stunning with some action scenes with some of the worst writing ever (actually there is no writing here) and dialogue since the last Hallmark movie. So disrespectful to the viewer and the comic books and the fans. A bloated hollow commercial project by the Disney sith.
299,"Horrible, terrible, stupid. All the bad names you could call a movie should be directed at this one.It's a pathetic excuse of a movie. It was cool having Guardians of the Galaxy in it, but even their humor and coolness was muted quite substantially.Why am I still even writing about this..."
300,"I haven't nt seen all the Marvel movies, but I've seen some - the Iron mans, the Ant mans, Cpt Marvel. I enjoyed them. I thought I'd go and see what the fuss was about. However this, is so formulaic, ridicilous and boring I couldn't take it for the whole film. I walked out after 2 hours, and it felt every bit as long as that. If you're not a huge Marvel fan already, you may well not like this film, because I feel it's somewhat self-indulgent. It's like an effort to squeeze a bit more money out of fans."
301,I wish I could say more about this but my title says it all. Nothing wrong with a good mainstream movie but I rather sit on my toilet for three hours than watch this crap.
302,Story is too weak to thrill anyone. the fighter and flying worms from thanos were supposed to die even at no strike. The culminating part (battle) of the movie was childish. 2/3 time was boring and ridiculous overacting scenes
303,My 9 year old after 30 mins of watching asked me if we were in the right theater. It went worse from there.
304,"Time machine was the worst idea ever. I couldn't even understand every inch of the stories, it make no sense to me."
305,"Time travel destroys any film...time travel doesnt exist in the physical world..its an invention of writers and authors to close plot holes and impress audiances...so, any film or book containing time travel, IS A MESS! so, i dont see any reason to grade this movie more than 2 stars...cgi, fights, ok , but a real good movie, must have a believable story! for me, sorry it didnt work...
question...why thor and hulk had to be humiliated so much in this movie ? why toni stark had to die? to offer the framatic essence to the story?is this the end of marvel heroes?"
306,"I was so EXCITED to see this movie. After I saw it, I was like.... WhAT A PIECE OF GARBAGE!!! To me, this film and Infinity War felt like it was rushed of not see any extra scenes that we were so exited to see.
This movie was ok, I mean like Time travel? Come on, I expected more from this director!"
307,"Last week I wasted 3 hours of my life watching the latest Avengers movie End Game. I am a massive Marvel fan and have loved most of the movies up to now. Lots of action and fun. What has gone wrong. I was looking forward to this film so much but was so disappointed. If you want action and fun go watch John Wick 3, Wow that is a film especially compared to this dribble.Were do I start. At the start, or should I say for the first 30 min all the characters are depressed and feeling sorry for themselves. Then they mention time travel, yes time travel. I mean after all Marvels great films and ideas the best they could come up with to get things back to normal was time travel. What next, Ironman (Robert Downey Jr) wakes up back in Ironman 1 and the last 20 years have all been a dream aka Dallas style. Come on give me a break the best they could come up with was time travel. Anyway 1 1/2 hours into the film I turned to my friend and said the last 1 1/2 hours must be amazing as this has been so boring and all the reviews say this is a great movie. To my disappointment it did not get much better. In the 3 hours of running time there is at a push 30 minutes of action and that is at a push. The rest is just a load of rubbish.So disappointed, won't be wasting my hard earned money on Marvel again."
308,So boring and predictable story with cringe moments such a dissapointment
309,"Rated over 8? Am i missing something? Most of the movie is filled with tedious flashbacks and boring confessions from the heroes. In fact, there were so many heroes that my head almost went dizzy, I was expecting someone like Mr. Spongebob or Tom and Jerry to appear at any moment. Maybe it could actually make the movie a little less boring.
The plot was so ridiculous, so embarassing... Same flat jokes, same senseless pathos from all the previous parts, and ZERO logic. They figured out they needed to travel in time, went to Stark, he said its impossible, blah blah... then he sat down for one evening, had another dull sentimental dialogue with his wife and guess what - he made a time machine in one day. Yep. (Oh, and at the same time he also made the exact copy of Cap. America's shield. So basically, if the only special thing about Cap. America became casual, what is even the point of that character's existence?)
In the end, Avengers is just like Transformers: a seemingly never-ending franchise with lots of CGI and the same plot in every sequel. But this time, hopefully, it's the endgame of this horrible money grab of a series. Just dont bother watching it. Please."
310,"Worst of the Worst !!!
After IW(which is amazing) this was a disaster. BAd bad movie !!!!"
311,A garbage with full of unpleasant characters and boring story and i call that a real charlatanism to stole your money and giving you a 3 hours long headache with minimum suspense and bad cgi and nothing more. i hope we never saw that characters anymore and never have such garbage anymore.
312,"This was a terrible film. I rented it and feel like I wasted my money. The movie is 3 hours long. 2 of those hours is just nonsense, comedy, and jabber. Then you get about thirty minutes of the big fight, followed by another thirty minutes of boredom. The male heroes are portrayed as buffoons, which is indicative of today's masculine-man-hating society. Based on today's man-hating culture, testosterone is evil. Women should be lumberjacks and Seal Team Six. Men should take estrogen pills and ask their wives to open the stuck peanut butter lid. I'm a proud sexist. I open doors for ladies. I also send my lady flowers just because versus craftsman tools.This was one of the worst Avengers installments ever. Writers are so busy pushing their masculine-man-hating agenda by making the two most powerful Avengers (Thor and Hulk) water downed buffoons. They failed to capture the essence of the Avengers. If the Hulk and Thor are not smashing something or someone that is extremely powerful, Marvel isn't worth watching IMHO. They are the ultimate warriors. Yet in this installment, they are childish buffoons. The nadless, testosterone-hating writers of today have devolved the franchise into an Everybody Loves Raymond-esque sitcom. However, Everybody Loves Raymond is better written."
313,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."
314,"It missed some feather for thor. Maybe a cooking scene with Hulk.
Would like to see a shower scene but just for the bubbles not for the actors.
No really... was it a joke.
Didn't get the buzz for this crap. Not so innocent as it seemed in its poor hidden messages anticipating the future makeover of the Marvel universe... and it's fall.
Sign me out."
315,"How can Marvel, the Russo brothers as well as the scriptwriters go from delivering the best superhero movie ever made, Avengers Infinity War, to offering such trite tosh as Endgame? I was so disappointed that I almost threw up. I suspect at the end of the day they ran out of ideas and thought its gonna be a great way to fool us fans by offering us the final movie to make an extra billion by putting together what seemed like the worst outtakes of a b unit.!"
316,I haven't watched the movie. It just doesn't deserve 8.7
317,If u r a marvel emotional fan then the film is for you don't have too much expectations like previous marvel movies
318,It's over boring movie and wont reach the level of other marvel movies
319,Wow! What a POS movie...So much talking. So much crying.. So much boring no action garbage. These high scores must be paid off. Don't believe the reviews. Stopped watching in one hour..and yes that first hour was painful. I can't imagine fighting thru another two hours. What a shocker. A three hour movie that stinks. Who's idea is it to make movies three hours?!?! Most of them are garbage.Skip this at all costs
320,"Horrible, wrapping things up for the sake of wrapping things up. Random stuff thrown together with no meaning or story."
321,"It was ok, not great just ok. I like infinity war more."
322,"It's as though Marvel tried to destroy its own franchise in one movie. They make fun of their own creation. Fat Drunken Thor, really? That's America's? Smart Hulk? I didn't care whether any of the characters lived through this one. And if they die, so what? They went back in time to save half the universe already.And the present Avengers were incompetent in the past. Why? For a bit of comedy? The dwarves from Time Bandits were better at time heists than these morons.I wish I hadn't watched this one. It poisoned the rest of the franchise. I don't know if I'll waste my time re-watching older MCU movies knowing the way this ended it."
323,They throw everything and the kitchen sink and it is boring.The story is so convoluted and starts as a Telemundo famiiy drama before becoming a mess of coincidences. The superheroes play a 5-minute tag sequence at one point.Sigh.Thor with an axe!!! Thor playing earth 21st century video games and drinking beer. I have nothing more to say.
324,Wow horrible weak Story..i feel like am watching epic movie and Meet the Spartans.......😒😒 don't waste your time watching this!
325,"I'd prefered seen dumbo !
I loved infinity war, but this one is so disapointing ! It's just à other movies of 33% Ironman, 32% captain america, 31% thor. And 4% for the rest of the bande without a good scenario or strory.
Characters are not treated properly
I feel used / stole my money. Captain Marvel is not in the movies at all. Even Thanos is so badly explain..."
326,Worst film of all time in the whole film industry.the most over hyped film ever in the world.absolutely disastrous and useless movie.
327,"It just shows the influence of media and the hype on the popularity of a movie.
It was the first time, that I fell asleep watching a film in the cinema.
It doesn't deserve to be among the top 250 movies of all time."
328,What have all these peeps seen in this movie i was soooo bored i fell asleep its a waste of3 hours of my life...pls dont waste ur 3 hrs on this
329,I did fins thia movie highly unrealistic. There is no chance this could happen i the real life!
330,The movie is not even worth half the rating it has got! It should be 3 or 4
331,They wanted to make a film and tell a story with CGI. They failed. Why are actors giving their faces for this? Its the only human thing left in it. Everything else is just CGI. Tells me nothing.
332,"Waste of money and time full of depressive heroes who cry like little babies for 5 full years. The prior is 100 times better than this crap with mediocre lines, but I guess that this is what the masses ask for..."
333,"I always like to watch a movie on the off chance it may be enjoyable.
In the case of movie series the chance you may get a bad one you need to watch the next to see if it makes up for the bad one.
This series has just got worse as it went on and this is just as disappointing,
It was that bad i feel asleep watching it.,"
334,"Infinity War was amazing, but why is this a 8 worth? I felt like I totally wasted 3 hours of time for nothing. i'm glad I didn't went to the cinema for this. Not only was the movie WAY to long, the story was so clichè . Only 30 minutes of decent action and the rest absolutely nothing! Everyone knew already what was going to happen before this movie came out but it could have been executed much better.Endgame is a total waste of good character development,acting and story. What they did to the Hulk and to Thor was truly unacceptable. The Hulk became some nerdy green giant that doesn't do stupid things and Thor became a very bad drunk guy not to mention that Captain America had the power to hold Thor's hammer al of a sudden? Like what? Killing of heroes is 1 thing, but killing of ironman is totally not needed. Of all those 500 avengers on that battlefield why him? Ironman was 1 of the characters that made this movie a bit interesting.The ending was just weird....This wasn't what I expected after Infinity War. Such a shame."
335,"Whaaaat? Time travel? Really? No way I saw 'this' coming... Except, I did. Oh no, Ironman and Black Widow are dead. Boohoo! Except nobody ever DIES in these movies (like the Red Skull-cough cough). They'll be brought back by some sort cloning technology or with some weird voodoo magic (...or time travel). It worked for Deadpool after all. The avengers literally couldn't go on any further. I mean the violence kind of escalated when they destroyed a city, then a small country, then a planet and finally the entire universe! You can't trump that! Although... Buffy the vampire slayer did save the multiverse. Was it just me or did Dr Strange gave the audience the literal finger towards the end? He did but this movie is PG13 so it wasn't that finger. Like everyone else who has a modicum of intelligence I too thought Thanos's motive was moronic as well as it was dumb. Try to follow my reasoning. He snaps his fingers and half the Universe's population is gone. What are the survivors going to do? Hmmm? The most logical thing is they will just breed again and then we're back to square one. We can't just assume that all species have the same gestation period as humans do. An elephant for instance has the gestation period of about 22 months, a whale about 16 months, a horse about 12 months, and cat and dogs about 58 DAYS... What about rabbits and rats? Oh about 22 days. My point is some species will repopulate their losses in a matter of days depending on how advanced their technology is or how fertile they are (we have no idea how aliens do their funny business and we don't want to know-just saying). So wiping out half the population isn't going to solve anything, quite the contrary. Humans would take about thirty to forty years to repopulate. In the meantime, you're going to have chaos and destruction following when people are suddenly disappearing when cars are suddenly crashing, planes are falling from the skies and nuclear reactors are going off or when nuclear silos are suddenly unguarded. All this would require more resources to be used to contain the chaos that would follow. Earth is tiny and we have limited resources, but the Universe has UNLIMITED resources! The Universe is very huge, LIKE HUMONGOUS HUGE! Any species that has mastered space technology can simply colonise an asteroid or planet and mine the heck out of it. Now, Thanos has a magic gauntlet which theoretically can give him whatever his giant heart desires. Even Thanos eventually acknowledges that his original plan is dumb and decides to recreate the Universe. Now THAT should have been his original plan. That I could understand. The Avengers used time travel to fix their problems... (Sigh-this is literally the laziest writing ever). The first time he snapped his fingers and kills half the Universe's population he becomes a gardener... A gardener! That is his endgame? Pointless genocide: check! Now I will go to my cucumber and tomato paradise: check! I wonder if Dr. Strange saw this in every one of his 14,000,605 outcomes and lost his mind. Did Dr Strange get so frustrated with all those versions ending up with Thanos gardening that he just gave up and gave him the stone? Why didn't Thanos dedicate himself to botany instead of being a warlord? I bet that by 14,000,606 it was the first time that it didn't end up with Thanos ending up in his cucumber and tomato paradise. So Ironman died because of some vegetables. That one version that Dr Strange wanted. Now let's talk about a geriatric Captain America (how did the writers come up this). Captain America goes back in time to be with the love of his life... How charming! Except that it isn't. He is a superhero with powers and knowledge of the future and the cold war and other really important stuff. Is he going to sit back while Hydra takes over SHIELD and destroys the very America he loves so much? What about Bucky who is being used as the Winter Soldier? I don't know about you but the Cap I know wouldn't just stand by and do nothing for 70 years. Hundreds of millions of dollars spent and twenty plus movies made just so Captain America could end up in a retirement home? No! Just no..."
336,It looked like a cartoon movie. I think the director showcased in the movie whatever he saw in his dream.
337,"I am very disoppointed ,actualy i know ,at the end if infinity war ,they gonna make it mess with ant man and time travel ,hardlu you see other charcters ,the way they make hulk off realy mess"
338,"I managed to watch 40 minutes of this crap, and then could not stand it any longer. You must be a true fan of Marvel Universe to see it until the end. If you are not, avoid - nothing makes sense in this utterly boring movie. Acting is really bad too. High-end special effects cannot save it."
339,"I thought the Infinity Wars was bad, but this has brought Marvel/Disney to a new low. The idea of going back in time and changing the present is as old as the hills, but it also opens Pandora's Box. It means you can do it again and again. Which negates the foundation of reality. This plot, unlike the last Avenger's movie, relies on pseudo-science instead of the supernatural. I love science fiction, but this was anything but. Spoiler: Stark looking at a Mobius Strip and somehow realizing time travel was possible was painful to watch. So then they go back in time, make everything hunky dory, as it was before Thanos, but Ironman get killed in the process. So not only did Marvel kill off it's number one action hero (at the box office), but it showed the world that nothing bad can ever happen, because we can simply go back in time and make it better. Interesting how all the characters scoffed at the idea as well, before they actually did it. Time travel movies are fun, but only if they can never be repeated. Using it as a plot device to restore everything to as it was before, was just a cheap trick. I would have been more impressed if Dr. strange found a new set of stones and changed everything back. As a Marvel fan from the Silver Age of Marvel (1960s &70s) I wish Disney would have stuck to the comic magazines closer and not tried to bring the Marvel universe to a depressing conclusion."
340,They could have cut an hour and a half of the slow unimportant scenes.
341,The worst of all the avengers sequence. Boring apart from some cool action scenes. Stupid scene when CA lifts thor's hammer wtf. Also we were expecting Dr Strange to show his real powers and see him more in the movie as he is the most powerful
342,"Predictable movie. Many ""magic"" moments as the unexplained moment of captain america in the end. Not so many dead people as hyped(only 2)"
343,"This movie dosent deserve to be this high on IMDb,it was bring and by far the worst avengers movie with a disapointing and predictable outcome,it ruined thanos and the heroes one with no casualties like every superhero movie,endgame was by far the worst most overrated marvel movie"
344,I loved all the other movies..but I'm not sure I can even finish watching this...3hours of not getting to the damn point already...
345,"...only to - after almost 2.5 hours of boring preparation - end up in a happy ending and of course more CGI laden version of ""Avengers: Infinity war"" with all the protagonists ever to have been in Marvel movies appearing on screen in a CGI festival which shows the true dilemma of modern movie making and the the Marvel world in special. They wanna pack it all in and in the end they get nothing, mixing it all up in a terrible way. We suddenly have Captain America to hold Mjölnir, Pepper Potts got a suit and fights (aargh!),Scarlet Witch seems to be the most dangerous opponent to Thanos, Thanos being apparently stronger without the stones (so don't go for them, dumb ass!) and among that all we have valkyrie riding her winged horse, just to mention a few. The only good scenes are the ones with Thor, and they are also the only ones where the emotional side is delivered in a believable way. Which is also a hint where the true magic of such movies _could_ be: telling stories of myths and magic, and not CGI overkill movies. Sadly, that's what we got once more, and the typical US approach anyway. So, this movie is nothing but 2.5 hours of time waste to end up in roughly 20 minutes of senseless CGI pseudo battle. If you watch it to be able to judge for yourself and get another idea of contemporary movie making, you can do that while making the dishes or doing something else useful in parallel."
346,"I'm extremely disappointed as it didn't have any cheese in the film and the film simply wasn't British enough. Thor and Loki's lovely accents were the only redeeming qualities, the rest was just terrible as i had to sit through 3 entire hours of annoying barely understandable accents with no cheese to get my love balls stirring. Afterwards I had to have several pints of tea to cheer me up, don't waste your money on this Britons."
347,"While I respect the fans going ga ga and people discussing the emotions etc, I beg to differ. I saw this movie yesterday after all the rush had died out. There were about 25-30 people in the Audi having seating capacity of approx 250.Pace: The buildup is slow and boring.Emotions: Forced and sometimes looks very artificial. You don't feel a thing. When some people said that they cried, I wonder for what. Action: It comes late and is limited. I expected more (isnt that expected in the avengers movies?)CGI: Was good.Storyline: Very weak. It could have been refined. Many of the characters were inserted and wasted.Length: It was unnecessarily prolonged, esp towards the end. They could have reduced the runtime by 20-30 minutes.Overall: Bad. Barely a one time watch, with lots of patience. The studios have created the hype and made their money. The previous avenger movie was way better. This one was a totally let down, just like the Game of Thrones final season."
348,Boring rehashed rubbish. Too long! Too many characters again!! Seen it all before and now I am bored of Marvel and DISNEY!!!!
349,Wost movie ever seen total waste of time no action no nothing just bad bad bad bad
350,"More than 2 hours of drama and only minutes of action...or at least that's what it felt like. Also, tons of that annoying Hollywood epic type of music to make me consider muting it."
351,"First, half of ""universe"" died and the rest can't go on, all heroes was crying without a life sense. Can't believe that. A child on a bicycle angry ¿for what? He was too young to loose the faith. The humanity always rise after a war, even if they lost the war, Germany, URSS, Jews, Spain, Japan. Terrible film message.Second, all the effort to bring out the Captain Marvel before the endgame and with the hope in her to solve the Thanos issue. For nothing, Captain Marvel do nothing... all expectations for nothing.Action only until the end, the rest of the movie was boring.Thank god Marvel is over, no need to know nothing about Marvel Universe. It was almost a bad addiction finally cure."
352,There's There will be blood and more recently Leave No Trace. And then there's this crap. Acting that makes my eyes hurt and a story so bad I just want to stop watching (which I did). It's movies like this that makes me lose faith in the art of film making. And the rating 8.7 just makes me wanna stop talking to people. What a waste of money...
353,About as bad as it gets - even worse than Captain Marvel and I thought that was badsave your money give this a mess a miss
354,Potboiler at best ... confusing to say the least. This was just an opportunity for these actors to make a shed load of money without trying. How it ever got 8.6 is beyond me ..
355,A complete let down as they tried to turn End Game into some family comedy bit. They should have stopped at Infinity War.
356,I really liked Infinity war and really wanted to see the next movie. To my surprise it was pathetic. Thanks God I wathed it on Blu Ray and many scenes I simply skipped.
357,"I don't know if I would like to go to another marvel film after that - the writing was really bad!
Why did Captain Marvel didn't do that instead of Iron Man? She is pure energy...
Why did Dr. Strange didn't opened a huge portal for Thanos and took them elsewhere?
Or more simply why no one let Strange the time-stone and he just make a milion years go by on Thanos army.
What happened to Thanos' ideology of saving the universe? Suddenly he just wants to destroy it?"
358,"Poor dubbing by Tamil.. horrible to see the movie...
Could have been better..
Worst dubbing...
Mismatch totally... everyone laughs for a serious scenes...."
359,Firstly I'm a big film buff. I watch on average one film per day crossing genres and countries. I watched the first two hours then turned this movie off and went to bed. Seriously two hours to cover what should only take about 40 to 50 mins. Normally films have twenty minutes to set the story and introduce the characters. This film spends one hour reintroducing characters from the other movies then the characters decide what to do. Then another hour of idle chit chat. This movie is full of itself. I'm so glad I didn't bother going to the cinema to watch this. I'm sure there was going to be some action at some point but I ran out of patience.
360,"Infinity War by far the best Marvel by a long way. However Endgame half the film was boring and only the last 10 minutes had an resembles to Infinity war.Thick Thor, Professor Hulk brilliant the rest average."
361,"I realise that I'm in the minority, here, but I walked out of this...this thing really, really angry. Oh, it's a spectacle, to be sure, but an empty one. To each their own, and more power to you if you enjoyed the film, but I couldn't. Why? A number of reasons. It'll be wordy, but at least you can see why exactly I only gave it a three-star-rating - and this is coming from a person who mostly reviews things she loves.
Anyway, here goes.
First, characterisation. Oh, boy. Let's start with a spiteful nit-pick. Those kept piling up, which is why I mention it. The Asgardians. I have a question, writers: why are the Asgardians fishermen now? Seriously, what gives? Asgard was a highly developed society with technology so advanced, it looked like magic. They had Star-Trek-esque power shields. They had hovercraft. They are not fishermen. Is that because of Norway? Not everyone fishes there, either and also, Asgardians are not Norwegians. It's like if you live close to a river and you specialise in engineering energy shields, someone suddenly pushes you into a boat, and goes: ""Fish!!!!"" Sorry, but no.
Then, there's the real problem: Fat Bumbling Thor. What was that? No, seriously. What was that? That's not Thor. That drunken, stoned, lardy, snickering, obnoxious fool is not Thor. Remember the first movie? Where he was a bit of an impulsive, boisterous tool but still overall noble, courageous, selfless, and cultured? The Thor who created some situational comedy without turning into a pitiable punchline? That's Thor.
Character derailment for the sake of komedy is not funny, nor is it excusable. It's just bad writing. It's gimmicky and I hate it.
Don't even get me started on how Nebula kills her past self without consequences or how years of character development for Gamora get wiped away. Awesome, that. Top notch.
The other characters don't fare all that well, either. What was it with Tony suddenly being ""tired and finally ready to rest"" or whatever (paraphrasing, here)? Since when? And Steve staying in the past and playing houseboy whilst Hydra run rampant and his best buddy gets tortured is maybe the worst bit of pathetic ""happy ending"" I've ever come across with. That's not something he would do. If he had a shot at saving Bucky in the past, he would. He wouldn't be this selfish. I also wonder how exactly that worked in everyday life. What did he do all day? The dishes? Peggy's life would be drastically different with Steve around. None of the future events would have happened, and there is simply no handwaving this away or ignoring it. The reason I'm harping on all these details is that added together, they just don't make sense. Everything is just off, and we're supposed to just go along with it like it doesn't reek of sloppily put-together, bad fanfiction? No. No, thanks. I'll pass.
That's all bad enough, but then, the plot kicks in, and boy howdy, is it a doozy. Now, I realise that time travel stories need to be taken with a healthy heap of salt (pun unintentional but fitting), yes, but I guess it's the entire package that made me so mad. It's the cavalier attitude, the nonsense, the lack of intelligence, the lack of logic, and all the la-dee-dah accompanying it. First of all, there's the ""oh, it's not like in Terminator and Star Trek"". What is it like, then? If I travel into the past, it's my future? Okay, so riddle me this: if someone goes to the past and kills their past self, then they're still dead in the future and will, therefore, never travel into the past. That's a head-scratcher, but how does the movie deal with it? TERMINATOR WAS WRONG!!!!!! HEY, LOOK, SHINY CARKEYS!!!! That's pretty much it. It doesn't make sense on even the most basic level. Even on first viewing, when we're supposed to just cackle at Fat Bumbling Thor and gawp at the big explosions, the whole plot simply falls apart. Cause and effect are a thing. If someone cuts off my finger in 1999, I'll still be Frodo in 2019. You can't just go THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS, make a wannabe-snarky quip, and then movie on to the next hilarious hijinks. What outrageous thing will Fat Bumbling Thor do next? How much more amusing will this light-hearted version of the Hulk be (never mind how all his problems just got magically solved for the sake of hurr-hurr-funny).
And how exactly did Steve get the MacGuffins back to the exact same moment in time? That's just virtually impossible, because there were always people around. Take the glowstick of destiny, for instance. Hail Hydra? Okay, so that means that Winter Soldier etc. didn't happen. Nothing past those movies happened, because how - how - did Steve get that thing back without anyone seeing him? There were people around at all times (even Howard Stark in the 1970s). How did he get the ether back to Jane? Did he sneak up on her? Even if, she would have noticed, and that would have changed everything. What about Natasha? How did that pan out? The lol-I-kill-me-first scene, and then Steve shows up and it's all hunky-dory? Why is she still dead? If it never happened, then she shouldn't be dead. But I guess the movie told me her death is final, so it's all good. Tell me, movie, don't show. I don't need sense or logic. It was in the script, so it must be true. And what about Loki? Not only did he (as per the rules of the movie) create an alternate timeline by stealing the Tesseract, but he's gone now from the main one, isn't he? And none of these taking-away-bringing-back gigs affected the other events occurring simultaneously in the MCU timeline? How?
The scenes went on for too long, too, especially the ""comedic"" ones. The one relatively in the beginning, with Scott and Bruce and those kids...yikes. It went on forever. The joke wasn't that clever or amusing in the first place, and it overstayed its welcome like nobody's business. And they kept doing that over and over (o hai Fat Bumbling Thor).
Sigh.
The problem is that all these logic failings, the bad characterisation, and the shucks-ain't-we-clever-thinking-is-for-dopes instants pile up. The movie feels like a clip show: a bunch of komedy or action sketches sewn together, written by folks who think their audience has the attention span of a tomato. That's the worst part. The lack of effort to tell a coherent story. Oh, I'm sorry, was I supposed to feel sad when Tony bit it? Because I didn't care.
It just made me angry.
I'm only giving it three stars because the effects were shiny and it's not the actors' fault."
362,"As Soon as ant man enters the movie with his time travel idea , the movie goes downhill to a point of no return."
363,"Not the Avengers Stan Lee created.
Emasculates the heroes, and attempted to sell a new hero.
The character Stan Lee created is completely destroyed. Even the abilities are messed up.
This is not Avengers."
364,"Overrated and slow as hell. I was yawning whole time during first-half, second half was little better. Don't know the taste of people nowadays creating so much hype for an average movie. I found Alita way better in all aspect action, story, vfx still it is underrated. Eagerly waiting for Alita's sequal soon."
365,"So..um...other than to wrecked up Thanos's battle ship, Captain Marvel should be the one who defeat Thanos, right? That's what all the fuss about, right?? She's not supposed to be taken down so easily, right?? If she were strong enough, Tony wouldn't be dead, right?????I thougth Capt. Marvel is the one who will deafeat Thanos, i wonder how will it be. Then POOF! In the end the stones did the job.Omg..so confused..."
366,"A creative lowpoint in moviemaking. I was looking at the clock The entire time.The tone is all wrong to me, with preposterous humour in some scenes, and way too serious and depressing in all the other scenes. Queue depressing 13-in-a-dozen music and teary eyes.The story is dull, uninteresting and unoriginal. If you were not a superfan yet, this story will not make you care.This movie doesn't stand in itself. The problem is I did not watch all 21 Marvel movies that came before it, so it was hard to understand whole sequences. We have a word for this in dutch: navelstaarderij. Staring at your own bellybutton. Meaning this movie (or Marvel) is way too self-involved.Pfff."
367,I hate to see iron man in this movie frankly because of his real life character.
368,"Finally it has come to an end. No idea whatsoever why I have watched these very merican action movies.
Do yourself a favour and watch paint dry instead.
The entire movie I was wondering: What the hell is going on now...
Maybe it could have saved the movie if they had cut down on the cost of the special effects and payed for a decent manuscript. Who knows.
Another thought... Why can anyone but Thor carry mjølner?
If anyone find these magic stones please undo this movie. Thanks."
369,"Sorry, I didn't like it. Too long, too nostalgic, too self congratulatory, too much..Given it was better than Avengers Ultron but not by much."
370,"It was ok, but not anything spectacular. I mean, the story was doubtful and the puns were dusty... Thanos had the infinity glove specially made by the dwarves of a goodly universe, but Tony starks tech could magically handle the celestial power... come on...?!?!"
371,"First off, phenomenal cast. I can't think of another movie that had even half the headlining talent that this one did. Still, it just plain sucked. Terrible dialogue, boring and repetitive special effects, and longer than Gone with the Wind.
Also, I detest Gweneth Paltrow. I'd have given a 2nd star if they'd killed her, but they didn't so I didn't."
372,"A fat overweight Thor throughout the film, a rat walking across by chance a device to bring Ant man back, weak storyline, weak battle, did Dr strange know all along? Was he the real hero? As soon as you got suspense.....safety was round the corner !!!!Just rubbish"
373,Infinity War would have been a more fitting end to the series. Endgame feels like it jumped the shark and stole all your money doing it. While the actors are perfect for their roles as you would expect the script and story and directors are out of their mind and can't agree on how anything works. This could have been trimmed to 2 hours with little lost. I would have been less disappointed had I seen Batman V Superman by mistake.
374,"Lot of hype, less of good content. Film is not bad, but still is disappointing in many areas. I have expected epic adventure movie with comic characters, and I've got summer family action flick with good humor, mediocre sound and 8/10 effects. Wasn't a waste of money, but doesn't live up to its hype."
375,"So can this be the Thor 'nightmare' sequence?
And what did Thanos have against garbage collectors that apparently they were all disappeared?
And 5 years later... try 10 on Scott's daughter.
And don't get me started on the timeline discrepancies...
And the first 30 minutes could have been done by the original trailer...
Tony out in space...lamentation of those lost...and Scott at the door. BAM! There.
Now get moving.
Didn't even mind the prolonged flashbacks to get the stones.
But what they did to Thor was a crime.
And cgi banner/hulk...not brilliant/not hulky.
And didn't address that 'floaty scary' figure looked an awful lot like red skull... The throw in a dash of SJW-which when Stan was alive wasn't even a factor... But fantastic acting by most everyone, especially rdj...
Waited the whole movie to see Tony reunited with Peter...
Glad hardly any marvel...
And how can Nebula's earlier timeline self be killed...but later timeline still live? Would have enjoyed it more with about 30 minutes left on the cutting room floor. Needed tightening up badly.
Sigh.
Captain America: Winter Soldier still my favorite...
but Russo bros needed someone strong to tell them 'no' ...
or needed to tell the writers markus and mcfeely no...
or hired a different editor...
imo.
Which is all this is.
Cue the wavy lines dream sequence graphics in 3, 2, 1....
Summary: Ok now take the infinity stones and do a 'do over'..."
376,"I don't understand why the critics are so crazy about this film. I'm an Avengers fan and went home disappointed.The plot is weak as time traveling does not make sense compared to i. e. Doctor Strange. If Thanos gets pulled out of the timeline and killed before he could get all the stones. But he can still get to destroy 1/2 of living things in the past? That doesn't make sense.But let's pretend it does and go further...How can Thanos be stronger than any Avengers, and worse, all Avengers at once, without the glove? At least Captain Marvel should be able to kick the hell out of him.Captain Marvel film was great, they introduced this amazing super heroine and she is in what... 5- 10 minutes out of a 3 hour movie?Was she created only to compete with DCs Wonder Woman?Why the hell they transformed Thor in a funny side kick?? Yes, we love Thor's humor but they went too far with the Big Lebowski ""joke"".By the way, what a mess to double the earth's population size after 5 years!And... don't wait for the credits just to listen a bell ringing.This movie is not a worth ending for a series of awesome movies."
377,"To be fair, it would be tough to top Infinity War, but was this seriously the best script they could come up with? The time travel trope was played out two decades ago, so why rehash it again? No idea, but the studio reheated some ""Back to the Future"" left-overs and went for the lowest hanging fruit on the tree.Okay, so now Stark and cohorts are going to fix is all by going back in time and ""pre-stealing"" the infinity stones then politely returning them the instant they were stolen to begin with presumably to ""not effect"" the timeline. Except, they already affected it when Loki ran off with the Tesseract when they bungled the first attempt. So what came of that? A giant, gaping plot hole is what.The whole sequence exists simply to remind the audience that Captain America still hasn't gotten over his first love, who by the way is about 60 years old at the time they visit, but she looks just the same. And flat attempt to make the audience feel empathy for Stark as he engages with his father commiserating on parenthood which is conveniently placed before he dies.Finally, the culmination of the Avenger's time travelling hi-jinks come to fruition when one of the smartest guys around, Banner-Hulk, puts it on and makes a wish. What does he wish for? To undo Thanos' eradication of 50% of the life in the universe. Makes sense right? But he's supposed to be a genius. Wouldn't a better wish be: Thanos was never born? Way more lives saved that way. But why didn't he? Plot There was a need to send Tony off with a heroes death which fell flat.So, to save Hawkeye, Future Nebula kills her past self with no apparent effect. If you died in the past wouldn't you cease to be in the future? Simple logic. Never mind, this movie jumped the logic rails shortly after title splash rolled.Ultimately, the movie plays like a Michael Bay boom fest and that's all it really has going for it. The script is cringe worthy and written with one goal in mind: To give the actors whose contracts were up, a way out of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Technically the movie is superior, but the writing is rubbish."
378,"Poor script. Poor use of characters. Poor logics especially where captain can hold thor hammer. Poor use of captain marvel after a big hype. It seems the writers thought of ending the series by praising American stereotype and screwing the main hero of the series, The Iron Man."
379,"Full of mistakes and Weaknesses
this movie violated Previous marvel movies."
380,"WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH THE RUSSO BROTHERS,,,,, After you did a terrible job of messing up the hulk in infinity war you then made it worst in endgame with nonsense professor hulk and to add insult to injury you also mess up thor,,,, you suck Russo Brothers,,,, you did such a fantastic job with the winter soldier and civil war two of my favorite movies,, what went wrong with endgame,,,,, you took two of the strongest and best avengers and turn one into a big slob and turn hulk into a big stupid teddy bear,,,,, seriously disappointed."
381,"So I just waisted 5 precious minutes of my life. This superwoman character is absolutely not credible! Come on, she is not destructible, she has no limits, she can go light years in space and bring on her shoulders a whole spaceship back to earth...no, why make a whole movie, and involve and kill a bunch of other way cooler and believable characters on the way, when you can just use this, the one and only, incredible all-can-do woman and just finish the film in 5 minutes. It makes no sense what you people did there. Even Superman had his limits, and was vulnerable and felt real, we were glad to accept him as a hero, because he felt like one of us. But she, she is nothing like us, humans, so I just don't get it. Sorry, one star for this nonsensical thing you call Avengers: Endgame. And yes, my rating is based on 5 minutes watching, but it is like reading a book - if you don't like the first pages, you won't fall for the rest of it..."
382,"This is hopefully the end of this long standing, inconsistent, money spinning series. And it's also the worst of them all. First hour or so...one or two fight scenes. The rest is back slapping in jokes that you'd have to memorise all the other films to get, long drawn out pointless 'science' scenes or 'hilarious' takes on each characters' past dislike of each other (didn't two used to fancy each other? It's like that never happened), and oh yeh the characters all change...like all the time. Remember when this one was bad and this one was good? Not anymore! And what is with their hair?! At the initial meeting to discuss the film concept did someone just say ""hair. Too benign. Let's jazz that up a bit"" because it's as if one of the Avengers is Vidal Sassoon all of a sudden.This should be buried in a pit for future generations marked ""stop watching after Age of Ultron"""
383,Why did marvel have to have to have Captain America and Iron Man Die. It made me cry repetidly
384,"In my opinion, they should have never filmed Endgame, it would be much better to finish everything with Infinity War, it would be much better because Infinity War was THE BEST EVER. and Endgame was very, very weak movie compared to it or any other marcel movie. I would prefer to not have seen Endgame."
385,"The only good thing about this movie is the nostalgia of old marvel movies,the time travel logic is stupid and its extremely boring just 2 hours of people morning then 45 minutes of cgi,its a disgrace to movies for this movie to be this high"
386,"A lot of the movie was pretty good. the fight scene was awesome, especially when all the female characters got together. however the movie really romanticised tony, which didn't make any sense as it was made clear that he didn't care about anyone but himself, and was unwilling to help save HALF of the universe in case it interferes with his life. in my opinion, seeing someone like nebula defeat thanos would have been better (and fitted her arc of wanting revenge on thanos for ripping her apart). overall, this romanticisation of a character who has spent every mcu movie, especially this one, only caring for himself and refusing to accept consequences for his actions become the hero was disappointing and ruined the film for me."
387,"Before you embark on a journey to watch this way-too-long movie remember that the time spent doing this cannot be recovered. You will not be able to go back in time and undo this.
Thor is, as always, well played and funny. Hulk is pretty decent and that's about it. Story is not interesting at all. Too many pointless dialogues that go on and on with no message whatsoever. The main idea behind the movie seems to be to let the guys do something, pack as many faces on screen as we can and, as long as there are explosions and some colorful CGI, it will be fine. There is no depth, no cohesion to the story. I stopped watching it at 2h 15 min trying to save 45 minutes of my life."
388,Could have been an hour and a half and twice the movie.
389,You show us that a women! sacrificed her life to protect us from the very person.
390,"Not a good movie, if your a fan of the comics go see John Wick instead, poorly written cash grab,"
391,"Thanos original purpose was to give his bride The Dead itself, the half of universe´s lives, as wedding gift. The evolving thing was too sense as a goal for a mad cosmic being as Thanos, anyway none care about it. The old comics are covered with dust and oblivion.I couldn´t stand the Captain America having the power of lightning and masterfully using Mjolnir, like he was expend training all his life with it. Totally sickining. ""He is worthy"" well he just need it to throw it, and wield it, just like that.Hawkeye the forgoten advenger was in a crazy rol, who cares? Where were Adam Warlock and Magus and even more The Living Tribunal?Why name this movies ""Infinity war""? with the excuse of the alternate filmic universe, very powerful plots are crumbling, one after another.Maybe that happens when you expect that new things overcome the old ones, or even that match just a little."
392,"If you like special effects then you will like this movie. If you like a good, intriguing, believable story with interesting characters then this movie may be very lacking in that department. The characters with all their interesting super powers just seemed to be a bore. Perhaps this sort of thing happens when you have too many main characters in one movie. There is no character development. One thing there is no shortage of is good looking special effects but it merely covers up the inadequacy of any kind of substance in the story lines and characters.The story totally contradicts itself. I'm not going to post spoilers in this review but in the end it really looked like the writers just made up unrealistic stuff that did not make any sense or had any sort of believable realism. If you tell a story like a 3 year old, other 3 year olds are going to love your story but adults are going to be bored to tears.They turned almighty Thor into a 3 year old, with mannerisms, intellect and all the traits 3 year olds display. But here we go again with Hollywood trying to emasculate men in all their latest block busters. Political nonsense that seems to be infecting and infesting big budget movies... It really just makes the world of Hollywood look all the more plastic.Perhaps the extremely high rating of this movie made me expect something really good and entertaining but all the enthusiasm I had soon turned in boredom and mild resentment because 3 hours is a lot to spend on something that seemed to bring only boredom."
393,"The great thing about the Avengers-Franchise has always been this winning scheme:1. A range of very different characters like Thor, Spidey and Strange, clashing together in witty and funny dialogues that showcases just how different they are. Spidey cracking jokes about deep philosophic insights of Strange, while Thor asks about beer.2. Incredible fight scenes3. Both may be linked by a variety of different narrative elements, from film-noir/detective over comedy to splatter.It's an easy base recipe, that may be filled with any narrative strings, so long as they are intriguing.Problem with the Avengers movies and the finale in particular is:The winning scheme is NOT used and the narrative underlying is poor, at best.They picked parts of a variety of comics (like the ""Thor get's irresponsible and fat""-plot), which is ok and linked them very poorly together. It's a series of short plots, loosely tied together with no red line (other than ""Thanos is the Endboss"").Secondly, the acting is poor, apart from Iron Man of course! Even Chris Hemsworth and Scarlett Johanssen do a really bad job at depicting their character. The digitally animated raccoon is a highlight in terms of acting.There is only ONE AVENGER-TYPICAL FIGHTSCENE, which is great, but does not make up for the rest.Foot-Note: As a Non-American, the Glory-Halleluja-Murica focus on Cap is too much. If you're patriotic enough, you'll love it, of course."
394,How did I not recognize Karen Gillan as nebula !! Funny at times otherwise kinda ridiculous
395,"*Spoilers Ahead*
To start with the review I'd like to say.... highly disappointing movie.
Wasn't at all upto the mark
They should change the genre of this movie from sci-fi to just drama....the majority of this movie contained just sentimental stuff....
It felt like I was watching a serial rather than watching a Science fiction movie which supposed to have action in it
95% of movie contained no action at all
The climax even wasn't upto the mark
When all the superheroes of this movie finally assembled u will be expecting something grand but nothing happens
There is no individual action scene of any of the superheroes even the supposedly ""mighty"" captain marvel has hardly for 5 mins featured in this movie
The sacrifice of Iron Man was kind off justified and also predictable
Nothing about Hulk!!
To conclude I'd like to say....one the worst movies of MCU till now
Even if they had extended the movie for 4 hrs with 1 hr fighting scene people would have still gone to watch it and would have appreciated more."
396,"It was somewhat entertaining. But the story was just beyond unbelievable. All the crying and moping and ""we're grieving so hard over here"" was dumb.Cap longingly staring at his girlfriend's picture all of a sudden felt forced. Like they decided last minute how his story would end so now, after I don't know how many movies of him not exhibiting that specific behavior, he's all love sick all of a sudden.Hated the scene where the lady super heroes get together to get the glove to the time machine. I get it, girl power! Yay! But it felt so damn forced I rolled me eyes so hard I saw the back of my skull.What made me dislike the movie most was that despite their best attempts at tying loose ends, it felt like lazy writing. Probably because when they wrote the first three movies they didn't have the foresight to drop (or use) Easter eggs that would be found in Endgame. An example is Cap's sudden longing for his girl.I honestly couldn't wait for the movie to be over. Glad I red boxed it."
397,"Quite possibly the worst Avengers film in the series.
Plot holes in every single scene, bland and cold acting.
Sad really!"
398,"Maybe I would have enjoyed this more if I were a real Marvel fanboy, although from reading the other reviews I might well have cause to doub that, but as someone coming to this film through all the hype, and the knowledge that this has just outgrossed Avatar in terms of the box office I am simply astonished how lacklustre this film is.Sometimes I dislike a film, and rail against it while secretly having quite enjoyed it, the objection being to some aspect of the film which annoyed me, maybe something ideological or political. But despite Marvel increasingly taking a political line on many things there is really very little in this film - at least on the surface - that one could find objectionable about it. In many ways in fact it is very routine and unobjectionable. But problem mainly relates to the film's obesity & overblown nature combined with a manufactured self-indulgence that was just annoying to watch.With respect to the latter this is mainly with reference to the final battle (where everyone who's anyone in the Marvel Universe makes an appearance) and the tying up of things in the post-coital glow: I get that this has been a long, epic and much loved journey for many film-goers, and also that fans will want a proper send-off etc for their favourites, but unfortunately this is done really badly, & inconceivably in an abrupt & unsatisfactory way, something that is hard to account for given the massive length of a movie that unfortunately in every other respect never ceased to feel slow and lumbering.In this regard we get some major goodbyes at the end with respect to characters who in this film at least we have seen for a matter of seconds. Essentially making any sense of this requires us to reference the history of these films, something which is simply bad & indulgent writing.The massive assembly of characters, particularly at the end, is supposed to be one of the pulls of the film, but instead it serves to make their appearance superficial and works to diminish them as individuals. Just imagine meeting your favourite Marvel comic book hero in real life: well, by the end of this film that actually sounds like a rather dull prospect: the overblown nature of the wrap-up diminishes everyone. Bringing them all together simply works to cancel out teir uniqueness & makes their fantastic and in their own right typically overblown powers (Captain Marvel especially) seem prosaic in juxtaposition with each other.But a bit of indulgence could be forgiven if the story was worth anything much. Unfortunately compared to Infinity, there's really very little to it. The time travel aspect to it was too referential with respect to other movies (self-referentiality hasn't really worked well since the Scream movies). Sometimes with these types of movies you get fans duking it out on account of whether an idea is plausible or not. Maybe that has been happening but if so I'd be surprised; the narrative device never seems to be taken particularly seriously & for that reason it's difficult for the audience to take it very seriously: the time travel aspect is simply what needs to happen in order to sort the situation out & the writers simply come up with necessary justificiation & a few quips to let us know that they know we've seen it all before a hundred times.A part of the problem here is that the character motivations while there on paper never really felt that real. Renner's character was perhaps the most convincing in describing the bleakness of the post-Infinity world, but it never really seemed quite enough. Half the universe wiped out - something worse than the Black Death or Mongol destruction at its worth - but it never seems like that big a deal. A tighter script, maybe focussed more on an aggrieved Renner or equivalent might have made it seem real & genuinely high stakes.Beyond that there was very little in the movie that was simply enjoyable, in the switch off your mind & enjoy the ride variety. Thor has already been emasculated - he is simply a fat slob, & for reasons presumably relating to the next Thor film - he never recovers except to discover some meaningless cliche about being himself instead of who he should be. Nebula although good, has too much screen time. Downey's Iron Man is never his old self at any time. Peter Parker's ok but not present for much of the movie & superfluous to the plot. Captain Marvel is basically Superman but with unpleasant attitude instead of character & functions entirely as a deus ex machine - a narrative device pretty much synonymous with copping out & failing as a writer.The only two characters who have a likeable part in the film pretty much are Antman, who gets a surprisingly large part in this movie, & the Hulk, whose initial appearance as a composite of Bruce Banner & the Hulk himself is actually genuinly intriguing for a short time. Unfortunately even this latter innovation works to diminish the character in the final battle where we don't even have the pleasure of seeing the Hulk properly smash everything up. Ultimately what is the point of a Hulk who is fully in control of himself?This is just a bad overblown movie that seems to take pleasure in down-sizing it's heroes in anticipation of a new greatly diminished future"
399,They've really scrapped the bottom with this one! Oh so Bad!
400,"I have watched the first part many, many times. Every minute of it was accounted for with importance to the plot - not wasted on snowflake emotions.This second half has an excellent plot, but oh, my - how it dragged on with talk and tears!I also didn't like Pepper suddenly being outfitted as a fighter?! lol! And, considering the future hero roles revealed in this one, can we eventually expect a white Black Panther, too?! Don't get me wrong - I don't want to see a white Black Panther.Several other points of disappointment, too.Bummer."
401,"This movie goes far far beyond the last season of Game of Thrones to become the worst expected thing of 2019. What a pain to me, what a waste of my time. Everything is just not what it should have been.
Believe or not, the comedian Thor is the best thing in this movie.
After putting second thought about the movie to write this review, I decided to rate it 1 instead of 2."
402,"This film is so garbage I can't even comprehend it, none of the ""emotional""scenes don't even make a tear shed at all, Tony Stark's death was terribly written and acted out, Robert Downey Jr.'s performance is horrid. The action scenes are slow and drawn out, and the ending scene is completely disappointing. This is a very inadequate superhero film compared to others such as The Incredible Hulk (2003) and Steel (1997). To sum it up a terrible example of Marvel's avengers."
403,"The worst movie in the world.
the movie goes from being a superhero movie to a comic. Full of errors, ridicule and absurd situations. Horrible!"
404,"It is overrated movie - and not in the same level as infinity war. I think the two movies could have been merged into one 3 hrs movie and spare us the hype of 13 years old fans all over the world.It is not worth it.Most of the parts are slow paced and dull, and the action sequences are not new or even surprising.Full of cinematic cliches."
405,"Captain America, Iron man and the Avengers all should have stopped after their first movie. Antman was terrible whatsoever and only Thor Ragnarok was a better movie than the first in the serie.
Endgame is a horrible movie and only rated high since it is the end of a well appreciated line."
406,In the story Iron man saves the day. They take away Iron man that's like my favorite superhero. The whole going back in time thing something was missing out of the movie. The movie was funny with Thor and hulk. Hulk trying to normalize his power. It just seemed like great fight scenes all for a pointless gauntlet. Just seemed like a lot of pointless fighting. They were trying to get everyone back in the process losing two characters. Didn't like the scene with Hawkeye and black Widow. They both eagerly wanting to jump off the cliff. When all they had to do was stop Thanos from getting it in the first place. The last two movies have been really hard to follow. I had more fun going to comic con watching coz play artists bc they looked better then the characters in the movie. Robert Downey jr in one scene looked unhealthily skinny in one scene. They need better story writers. The action scenes where good but the story line just seemed off. It seems like I'm ready for them to bring in new actors and better storyline. I feel like the writers really need to dig deeper into the comics. Bring back to life and give people a glimpse of the scenes from a comic book. Stan Lee said that you know the people can make the movies anyway they wanted too. You know for a high priced film they can do better.
407,"The half part is boring, and its not really fun to see so many super hero, not a really good inspiring story or no story at all. Glad it finally ends."
408,"I'm confused... How can one fail so miserably when you have basically an infinite budget to create a film?!What a let down!
Who even gives a about Hawkeye?!"
409,"This was a terrible movie, no one and convince me otherwise. Over hyped and with a poor storyline. There were some good moments and scenes, sure. But overall? No. Just no."
410,"The plot was messy, and so vast, with so many amazing characters, who were all simply diluted into one giant mess of a movie. Didn't really find the humour amazing either."
411,"The drama was not as it should be, the Comedy is not so funny and infinity war mavie was best events were excellent than endgame and there was not harmony in the movie"
412,"...and if I lasted more than an hour, I'd probably come up with more adjectivesthis is THE worst superhero movie in a line of really bad films. all the 'old' cast (who reeeaally got older throughout the marvel cineverse) looks like they've just came to get their final paycheck. it just feels forced, like a bad commercial, or like a prog rock song that should've ended few minutes ago. none of what we see makes any sense, there's no sensible plot , even ""fun stuff"" comes off as rather sad. and that's the word that describes the final (?) avengers movie the best way - sad..."
413,This movie is so boring.Too many unnecessary details.You have to sit in movie for 3 hours so i dont think its worth it.I waa dissapointed and really sad after watching it.Dont waste your money and this movie doesnt deserve anithing accept 1.
414,"If you ignored the PC-stuff in the last movie, it was still a pretty enjoyable movie. But this? Nothing was coherent, it was too long, and it it wasn't until the very end that it delieved any decent action."
415,"I gave 3 stars because of action scene in last half hour of movie.Lets start with the beginning. avengers are trying to show emotions for first 150mins of the movie. It gets real boring real fast. Everybody is sad & useless. Guys, we get it, your friends are dead, now stop being sad and start showing some passion to avenge.
Hulk has lost its charm of being that wild, mean, funny character.
Thor has lost his planet, his people, his brother, his girlfriend, his parents and he has lost his looks with all the charm he was good for. He gave away his throne too in the end.
Thor also lost something more precious then all of this....Can you guess what? He lost his place in the Marvel universe. Wanna know how? Directors made sure Thor is not the only one who can call up the hammer when he pleases.
Can you imagine anything left for Thor in Marvel universe? I thought so...Captain America can call up Thor's hammer and use it as he pleases. This is the biggest blunder of the Marvel production. Cap has no magical power and he sure as hell is not a God of any place.
Trust me when I say this, when captain America call up the hammer by raising his arm up and hammer came to him ""All the sheeps in the theater were clapping"" . They had no idea, they got fooled right in front of their faces. LOLNow lets get to time travel. Its an idea that any Director/writer uses when they have no story, no sense, no passion, and just want to make money by fooling people. Avengers story writers were stuck and didn't know what to do.
In time travel you can do anything and change any story you want. NOT FUN AT ALL.Another blunder is that Iron-man dies while he had all the power of the universe in his hands. ""Use common sense"". How can the most powerful person in universe dies? I know how, give the story to Marvel universe and they will manage to kill that person without using any logic and people will believe it.This movie shows iron man an old white haired/bearded guy who lives In the cottage. Very weak, Anxiety filled man. where is that full of life, charming, passionate, avenging iron-man? Long gone after he got married....Marvel universe has changed the meaning of Action movie in to an Emotional movie with 2&1/2 hours of whining out of 3hrs of movie.Avengers: End game genre says its ""Action,Adventure,Fantacy,Sci-fi"" they left a Big part of movie genre ""DRAMA""
I urge the IMDB to get the genre right next time so people know what to expect.Infinity war was the best movie of Marvel and Endgame was the worst."
416,"The alternate title for this film: ""How to Cram a 90 Minute Movie Into 3 Hours."""
417,"A tremendous production, with lame script, very obvious and almost boring time line, I hardly kept my eyes open to watch it to the end. The movie was also too long for the poor content. They could have told that sorry in 1,5 hours. Oh my God... and Thor... seriously? Is it a joke? And captain America holding his hammer... that finally destroyed the image of the great Thor. Pity!"
418,"Completely shocked at how bad this is. Thought marvel did a great job with infinity war, with character development and tying the story all together.Endgame is the exact opposite. Back to the cliche terrible jokes, no character development. Focus on the worst actors, almost no screen time for all the most talented members of the new marvel cast.Back to the drawing board required for next avengers movie.Genuinely awful film!! So disappointed."
419,"I like the way all the plots come together to please the Marvel nerds, but geez it's boring. It reminded me of star wars 2 (or was it 3?) just loads and loads of abysmal cgi. Smashing, punch, zapping. Lots of creatures, lots of people running around. I watched it over 3 nights, it was that shallow. Unlike some films you can't stop, this made me doze of. They must've spent the budget on the cast and left none for story or cgi. Some of the characters were so forgetful I don't even know who they are. Who's the guy that looks like jesus? who's the lady that has red glowing hands? I would look on imdb, but the cast is so big I can't be bothered."
420,"Infinity was one of the best films ever! This is a disgrace of a follow-up. Slow, elongated and boring. I sat through 1.5 hours and gave up, waiting for something to happen. My advice, do not bother!"
421,If you are a 7 years old kid or you have a 7 years old mind you will love this movie ...
422,"The Russo brothers use the Infinity War-created hype to deliver a bad, lazy, pockmarked, and contradictory script to the pillars they themselves had built at the beginning of this adventure."
423,"Watched to see why so much hype. Audiences hear the hype and lose their minds. So dull. Downey is as always, or at least used to be, enigmatic. The idiocy of the script made me realise the viewers that like this drivel like nothing more than cult like worship of actors names, fictional characters and nothing else. Last one was good but this one was lamer than the new Hulk. Absolutely nothing to gain from watching this Disney reprise to a soy latte drinking generation. GOTG 1 or 2 was at least funny but this was just plain dull scenes welded together like a very expensive TV series. Petty in every way except the budget."
424,Let's see ... we can't write a decent story or come up with anything original any more. So let's just throw every character ever conceived of into a giant mashup & that'll make a great movie! Right? WRONG!!
425,"Very cheap dialogues
Time traveling does not make any sense with major holes
But dialogues are the biggest hole in this movie
There are some serious nonsense in the movie
I know it's super heroes and fantasy
But at least try to make me believe"
426,I'm glad I didn't pay to see this one... Infinity war was way better...
427,"The curtain call of the Avengers is entertaining if painfully convoluted and long. Unlike most of its predecessors, ""End Game"" is over done in the same vein as the Star Wars franchise. It's a disappointment compared to most of the prior Marvel films. I own most of those movies on Blue Ray. I will not be purchasing either of the last Avengers films."
428,This was the worst movie from the whole series. I'm disappointed.
429,"Man! I thought Infinity War was off the hook, but this one...
A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.
It's fun it's dramatic, it's like Lord of the Rings with one less movie. Three hours well worth the ticket.
Stan Lee would be proud! Nuff said!"
430,"Just in few words:
You go to the film thinking it will be even better then infinty war and thor ragnarok ! Both were great, heroic and very entertaining!
But here is what you get from 3 hours of watching:
Thor ""god of thunder"" who almost killed thanos n th last movie : a chubby, ruined, drunk addicted man ! His storm breaker can't affect thanos that much!The Hulk : he was afraid and hide last movie so you expect his super comeback with a massive ragging revenge : turned into brucebanner attitude with a zero readyness to any fight and even hurt his arm during the film ... well, the character ruined ...no hulk!Iron man :dissapointed and look like a sick man all of the film ! Then died at the end !Captain marvel : the beauty superman of the mcu ... the unstoppable, the proud , well the one we saw a week before in her own film doing miracles and it was clear the she will save the day and lead the attack in endgame ! When all ruined in infinty war nick fury sent her a message just before he vanished .. it was like ""well if things reached that level we should summon the super girl .. so what we got at end game: no rule at all , didn't show up for most of the movie , then when showed up she did nothing important , nothing big .. well captain america did better than her I cannot understand how! Even her good look , she cut her hair boy like !!Well what was left in the movie?! The real super characters were Hawkai and captain America who should be by far weaker than the above heros and thean thanos of course !!Final word i watched the movie and asked where are the avengers?!"
431,"Absolutly terrible film. Endgame does not have any of the power, fights, or any part of any Marvel movie. This feels like a horrible one-off DC movie. The story could have been good but WORST follow through I have ever seen. They completely destroy The Avengers from what you have seen so far. The story is slow and seems like they didnt care at all how it ended. The fight scene is rushed and you get to see each person take one swing then they are out. Infinity Wars set up an amazing open end and Endgame ruins 10 years of Marvel films. I am no longer a fan of Marvel. Thanks for the decade long build up to this. And its the last Avengers film, at least with the ones that we know, so they can never fix it. So if youre looking for what you have come to expect from Marvel movie... Look somewhere else."
432,"Mediocre in the extreme for easily pleased geeks who have zero appreciation of real cinema Too many characters, poor script and cringe worthy dialogue all add up to making a predictable mess of a movie."
433,Too many plot holes. The first 90 minutes were really slow. The next 90 minutes were too rushed. Infinity war was wayyyyy better.
434,"When you see a movie with a 8.5 rating then it must be brilliant. Sadly not the case here. This movie is hugely overrated. I've seen all the previous movies and they have all been great and I understood them. This one I was scratching my head thinking what on earth is going on?
The plot was an incoherent ambling mess....too many characters, no flow or direction. This looked like a movie edited from bits of previous movies.
I'm surprised this is rated so highly....I'm very disappointed that this was a lazy movie....a waste of 3 hrs."
435,"Short and to the point it was a lazy effort. Decimating beloved characters Thor and Hulk and using a weak ""Oceans 11"" plot to make it seem clever did not work. I watched it once and have yet to get over it."
436,"Nothing to say a pop corn movie, marvel must to create R category movie"
437,"I never did side with either DC or Marvel - even as a kid in the 1960's. There were superheroes I liked and ignored the rest. Now, while DC is showing us how poorly a film can be made (particularly ""Justice League""), Marvel has aced 60% of their 22 films to date in my opinion. I wish that was the case with this one. It not only underwhelmed me, it didn't serve it's predecessor well.I certainly don't fault the cast because outside the handful of main characters, the rest were merely background and foreground. After Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow, the rest of the cast were so many that they seemed like they were there for scenery. And like ""Justice League"", ""Avengers: Endgame"" suffered from the ""more is more"" syndrome that may please the under-10 crowd, but takes meaning away for us older viewers.Let's not overlook the cop-out remedy in science fiction these days - the reliance upon time travel to get out of a script jam. I realize it was a necessity in this particular chain of fictional events, but after a while it seems like (pardon the musical reference) a long, drawn-out guitar solo that has you wishing the band would get back to the song.This review isn't due to Thor (my favorite Marvel hero) growing fat and channeling his inner surfer dude, Tony Stark losing his life or Gamora 2.0 being the anti-Gamora. My regret is FOR the franchise instead of me as a viewer. They ended on a sad technical note due to unnecessary goings-on that I'm sure they worked very hard at trying to tie up in a movie.Another point that detracted from this film, and a few others in the Marvel cinematic universe is their social messaging. They didn't need to preach woman power because superheroes already have that built into their character. Here, it's shoved into our faces to signal their fashionable virtuosity. In other words, if there is a female superhero in a film, I don't need to be reminded that there's a sexual revolution going on here in reality. Theirs are formidable personas without need to be underscored.Using another musical analogy, this movie was like the members of Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin and The Who taking the stage at the same time and playing their sets. Apart, they're the best. Together, they're just noise. ""Avengers: Endgame"" would have been better if they pared down the scope, although I understand why they went the way they did. A franchise as successful as MCU set itself up for such a debacle. I'm grateful that it wasn't much, much worse.I thank those at Marvel for bringing to life the characters I read about in comic books at the corner store. They did a very good job overall."
438,"Walking in, given Marvel's latest publicity, I was expecting, well, I was expecting an absolute cringe fest, and thankfully I didn't get it. In fact, there were only a couple of absolute cringe moments and each dealt with Brie Larson, particularly her appearance in the final fight.Thankfully though, Marvel showed a lot of restraint with that and as a result the movie really belonged to the characters that we all have invested over a decade of love and loyalty in....and honestly that was a relief. There were times where the film looked like it wanted to go the other way, and put the OG Avengers in the backseat. So, credit for not doing that.It feels a lot more like Kill Bill 2 in atmosphere than a real Super-Hero movie, all the really fun big fights were reserved for the first film and what's left is a long closing act that is more concerned with tying up loose ends than delivering on over-the-top action. And it works for a send off film after a decade of investment.So what you have feels very much like an intimate and sentimental film made by old friends at send off...or a funeral...but in either case it is absolutely appropriate.Unfortunately, you have the enormously epic CGI battle at the end and I, for one, am kind of done with that trope. It's starting to bore me now, and, honestly, I would prefer something a little more authentic. But, that being said, the film at least called for it.We've seen battles like that before, Black Panther, Aquaman, Infinity War, Lord of the Rings, and, honestly those CGI armies lack any real intimacy. So the end is kind of a bore compared to the rest of the film.The highlight in the film would be Thor with Hulk coming in as a close second. They steal the show from the moment they are introduced and the trademark MCU humor that Black Panther and Captain Marvel utterly lacked. And the humor was a source of comfort after two films that made vague threats of taking themselves far too seriously for a superhero flick.The wrap-up was more than satisfying if not heart-wrenching at moments making it a great send off for a decade of time and money invested in the characters, however the legacy that the MCU is passing on seems in trouble nonetheless and we can only hope that it doesn't go the route that the MCU has been teasing and toying with and continues to deliver fun superhero movies and not the heavy-handed or deadly serious films they have threatened the audience with."
439,"Reaching for the stars, failed to take off from the orbit."
440,"I dont even wanna spend my time here writing how bad the movie and the story was, it was just soooooooooo awful"
441,"One just gets the sense that this movie took a subtle yet noticeable shift away from what captured many people's hearts in the earlier MCU movies.The actors give off the feeling of being forced to portray a role that used to be natural fits in order to impose various woke messages. There are so many but they come at a rate of every couple of minutes, ranging from blatant grrl power, to emasculation and so on. Muddling along.Aside from the odd action scenes, this movie could pass as a drama."
442,"They robbed us with the last move, for goodbye!
It is all about the money!"
443,"This movie is absolute garbage. The hype for this movie was incredible, but the movie failed to live up to the hype. 20 mins fight sequence in a 3 hour film 😂. This movie is a waste of time and whoever watches this crap, please help them"
444,"This film has practically no story.It is just Marvel throwing everything at us hoping to justify its budget with drawing all sorts of fanboys and of course they succeeded.
The part where Thor drinks earth beer and belches is so stupid.Fin."
445,"When half of the universe has been wiped out, when your dear ones passed away and when all hopes have been faded, don't worry, just ask a big green guy to help you travelling the time and all your problems will be solved. That basically sums up the film. All's well that ends well except for a philanthropic billionaire in a metallic suit who gives his life to save the universe...how original!
All the fake emotions and childish humors from the post 2000's superhero movies are masterfully treasured here as well for the delight of the simple minded. Adding all the enjoyable special effects and the diversity of the superheroes eclipsing the incoherent simplistic plot, and that gives you the most profitable movie of all time. Better on the form nothing on the substance if you ask me. But well, to each his own!"
446,How can Avengers travel back to the past and why Thanos is powerful even don't have any stone. That movie is illogical at all.
447,"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation."
448,"And i did like the previous ones. The first part was also not so good but this one was empty .... i totally don't understand why many people did like it. The aspects i usually like in this series is the humor and fun. This one didn't have almost any jokes and the storyline, is (as usual) pretty idiotic. There was not even any sophistication in the plot, just ... three hours of nothing. i don't rate it with 1/10 just because there were a few well done landscape shots...Come on, earth, stop spinning... i want to get off..."
449,"Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story."
450,"Thought it was boring, can't remember anything I liked about it. Only went cuz a friend said it was good, reminded me a bit of Harry Potter."
451,"Now, that a week has spend after his releasing ay theatres, i'll explain muy question in Pesce.
After five or six years after this, could there be something about this movie that makes recomended, else of his hype and the marketing?I Am not a really Marvel or DC's fan, but i loved some of their movies such as; DC's: Dark Knight all, Wonder Woman, Man on Steel, Shazam. And Marvel's: Guardians of the Galaxy, Dr Strange, Winters soldier, and of Course: Infinity War. But i was waiting a lot about this, i has too big expectations, them go to the midnight releasing and i found a fast food product of movie; horrible script, horrible performance, stupid logic, terrible story.
Really is this the current cinema's way?
I ll'get out of this awful and cheap movie theather."
452,"This was rubbish. Loose story line that made no sense, a hulk that stays the hulk..what the hell disney. Stick to Mickey Mouse and Cinderella. You messed up an awesome franchise"
453,"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment."
454,This guy is a horrible actor and ruins the whole experience
455,"Very boring.. Not gonna see again, Will however see the first two installments, as they are way better."
456,So bad they shoukd of thought about this for lonher
457,"I have fast forwarded the last part of the movie, I was that bored and irritated by it. The duration of the movie should have been half of what it is. On top of this cheap one liners, unnecessary character introduction, Tonnage of bombing without any casualty (intimacy of Iron Man and Spiderman amid this bombing, who the hell does war like that?!), cringe worthy effort (by Thor's not so funny comments, Hulk acting to smash thing and of course, Spiderman's conversation with anyone) to make it look funny just destroyed the gravity of a movie that has such a sombre title. And everyone is making a time machine in his backyard along with people who are supposed to have not knowledge of physics at all let alone be capable of preparing a time machine and by this time use of time machine to solve a problem has become such a cliche that it just trashes the originality of any idea. Overall its bad experience and a long one."
458,"It could have been better, the first part had a more complex screenplay."
459,"333. Avengers: Endgame. After the events of Infinity War, which did not last for infinity, cell phone gamer Thermos got his wish he deleted half his apps on his phone, after collecting all the Bejeweled gems. So what now? Well, those of the game app The Avengers that are left, get mad, so they stroll over to Thermos' place and behead him, rather easily... the excuse is, cause he was worn out and weak after using the stones, yea ok lets go with that. So what now? The End? Right??? No, they're not satisfied with the realization that in war people die, even the good guys, so the answer is: Time Travel. Thus a convoluted plan is born to travel through time, getting the stones back to create the game glove to bring all the dead folks back. So by now I've sure you've seen it, so spoilers be damned and my issue with the ending... The Captain America time line... The movie states, all other time travel movies are wrong, they're rules are right. You jump through to a different time, that is your reality now. So the Avengers plan works, though they screw up each timeline they go to, giving Disney enough material to make alternate universe versions of the same movie forever, oh wait, they do that now... The final act is for the Captain to bring the final stone back, to his original time and come back, to i guess rebuild and get ready for Avengers 5, i dunno. But he decides to stay back then and make a life with his lost lady love, creating his own new timeline, where he still got all muscley apparently, however this would mean that all the events of the MCU did not take place in the Captains new timeline, so when he randomly shows up as an old man to the spot where he left the other timeline, a timeline he ended by leaving it...the events of his life were drastically different and in creating this new time line, the others are null and void because they now exist in an alternate universe where old Steve Rogers does not. If your gonna say all other time travel movies are wrong, at least follow your own rules. Filmbufftim on FB."
460,"Only a month or so back I was talking to a friend about how much I hate it when serious movies use time travel to get their characters out of problems. I have no problem with movies like 'Back to the Future' or 'Hot Tub Time Machine' that are both comedy based and use the time machine as a plot for the movie as opposed to a solution for characters problems. When a serious movie uses it though it as lazy as writing as dream sequence in my opinion.At the end of the day though that just underlines the problem with these movies. The heroes are far too powerful. Whatever power they need they simply possess conveniently. Heck, 'Dr Strange' can even see into the future to know exactly what to do to make sure everything turns out alright. If that isn't the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie I don't know what is.I felt like the movie went very much as expected as well. Sure some characters die, however they were pretty much telegraphed to do so long before the movie came out. There also seemed to be a lack of conflict as key moments. A lot of things went far too smoothly for my liking in terms of the plan. Finally, the ending with 'Iron Man' simply pulling the glove off 'Thanos' - what the hell was that? Was that supposed to be clever writing? 'Thanos' just standing there for an eternity doing nothing waiting for someone to stop him?A lot of the jokes failed to land too. This was a surprisingly unfunny movie. In a 3 hour movie I got maybe 3 light chuckles out of the film. Every joke just felt so forced and some of the characters who don't have a comedy background delivered them very poorly. 'Avengers: Endgame' is three hours of my life I would like back."
461,"Sry, but this isn't a 8,7 rating movie.
I get that it's all doom and gloom with what happened in the last movie, but u don't drag that out for 2 hours.
Main acts becomes sideshows, story is a mess.
Put in a bit of woke and u release it.
I will not rewatch this."
462,"Just overall badly written - down to the individual jokes not being funny, the side stories being uinteresting and the main plot also didn't work.Marvel apparently wants to reboot the MCU, by ""demoting"" or changing a lot of characters. None of the ""demotions"" were well done - instead of epic fights against Thanos resulting in the hero loosing his powers or getting injured, they more had them just slip our the back door. It is strange that you would miss an opportunity to have a batch of heroes killed in an epic battle, and instead srite them out the story with bad plotlines.The storyline was also a mess. The initial half hour or was it an hour before things got started could just have been cut down to five minutes, forgettable as it was. It was like the writers just gave up writing a meaningfull story from start to finish, and instead just had a main plotline patched together by coincidences (the bad guys randomly finding out what they heroes were doing), some side plots and then a big fight at the end.Even the selection of music was bad, there was hardly a scene with a really good song fitting a scene. This is something Marvel has been very good at, so it's strange they suddenly couldn't get that right.The point of the movie seems to reboot the MCU, removing a lot of characters because the actors playing them got too old for the roles - and maybe the writers had problems to create a story with a designated quota of heroes dying. I don't know what went wrong in the writing process, bur something for sure did."
463,1st hour and a half in I was ready for it toend so long and dragged out the last 30-45 mins made for good watching but that's it
464,"But I never liked super hero movies to to begin with and got suckered in by a couple good Marvel movies.
Time travel is a such an easy lazy fix. Only interesting charter was the potbellied super hero that wanted nothing to do with any of it."
465,"I think it was one of the worst superhero movies. In this film, they destroyed all the preparations made in the previous episode.
It was very good to use the idea of time travel and it could be much better.
The story of getting the stones was written without much thought. All stones were very comfortable. Changes that were ignored in time.
Captain Marvel's role was very empty. The character's presence in the film was really wrong."
466,"Did i watch the same movie as everyone else? why are so many people leaving such high ratings for this movie? i guess it being the end of it factors in, but it just wasn't a good film. some good parts, but they take up like 3% of the film."
467,"Hulk, a strong,manly hero was reduced to a teddy bear.
Thor-a cry baby.
This is marvel's way to fight with ""toxic masculinity"" in my opinion.
Also time travelling is like cheating. Time travel, kill the bad guy, save the day, come back to home and drink beer.
This movie isn't an 1 but also isn't anything above 8."
468,"Nothing really happening ....Captain Marvel is in it for a bit...Black Panther was in it too, not sure whyDramatic scenes purely over the top....just seems like they tried to fit all 5000 Avengers into this film and actually forgot about the film3 hours, I'll never get back .......one good battle scene tho"
469,"Except last 30 minutes, the whole movie is so lame. Bad writing. One of the worst movies Marvel ever made."
470,It's rewind time everybody! I hate this movie. Go away.
471,"Time paradoxes are glossed over, bad story writing, completely wasted my time"
472,Didn't like this marvel movie and I didn't like the others
473,"Rating 10/10
Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!"
474,"I am a long time fan of the MCU. I had a lot expectations going into this film. But Avengers: Endgame was a complete letdown. It was very hard to live up to the hype that the movie generated. But it could've been done in a much, much better wayI'll start off with what was good in the movie. The technical details were amazing, in true Marvel fashion. The background score and visual effects were almost flawless. It started off well, with good pacing, and the final battle scene was really well done. There were a lot of moments, especially during the time travel portion of the movie, which pay tribute to 11 years of Marvel films and it genuinely shows us the legacy that Marvel created.That brings me to the bad parts. Endgame seemed to be dedicated to these moments. As nostalgia invoking as these moments are, they do absolutely nothing to further the plot of the movie. I also felt that the tone was too humorous for a movie about people dealing with heavy loss and defeat. The time travel rules of Endgame, which creates an alternate reality rather than affecting the main timeline, felt a little too convenient as it prevents their actions in the past from having any effect on the present. The movie got a little slow in the beginning and I was bored during this portion. I have never been bored watching a Marvel movie and this says something about the epic conclusion to the Infinity saga. But the pace picks up during the time travel portion.Coming to characterisation, Tony Stark was the only character who had a proper arc. His relationship with his family along with the amazing performance by Robert Downey Jr. made his ending all the more heartbreaking. Steve Rogers strapping on his broken shield and standing up to Thanos in his 'I can do this all day' manner was a reminder of why we love him. But his ending was forced and completely betrayed his character. Even Chris Evans' performance (honestly I can't even imagine anyone else playing Captain America) cannot save Steve Rogers from bad writing. We have seen him say goodbye to Peggy in Civil War. And after five or so movies of not even mentioning her, Peggy is his only way for a happy ending? This is a complete disservice to Peggy's character which was developed in Agent Carter. We see Steve pining after his long lost love rather than mourning his friends whom he lost in the snap. This completely discredits the relationships he formed in the 21st century and his relationship with Bucky. Thor was shown to be completely depressed and lonely. After what he has been through, this is completely justified. But he contributes nothing to the team despite being one of the original six Avengers and the fat jokes started becoming distasteful after a while. He was a well loved character among the fans and the writers didn't even give him a proper conclusion. Natasha's character was treated horribly. Hell, she didn't even get a proper funeral. Hawkeye having a family helps us connect more with his character. But that's all his character has got going for him. Professor Hulk felt kind of bland. I missed his trademark anger which was portrayed so well in the previous movies. Nebula, Rocket, Scott Lang and Rhodey had pretty good characters despite not having much of an arc. The female characters (besides Natasha) didn't have much importance to the story and I felt that the final showdown with all the female characters was put there as a part of a political statement more than anything else. Don't get me wrong, I love strong female characters. But spending a whole movie without giving them enough screen time and then showing a badass 2 minute sequence with all of them is not female representation. Even Captain Marvel, being one of the strongest heroes, had very less screen time. And finally coming to Thanos. Thanos was a nuanced, relatable and, at some points, reasonable villain in Infinity War. But all that character development regresses in Endgame. In Endgame he is presented as a generic villain who is evil just for the sake of being evil.Endgame had its moments, but as the epic finale to which 22 movies have been leading up to, it is a complete letdown. Given, that to make a movie with proper characterisation and character arcs for so many characters in under 3 hours is a hard feat to attempt, but we have seen Marvel do it before with Infinity War. Endgame was all lazy writing and cheap fan service. It could have been the epic conclusion, the fans and the characters deserved but it ended up being a huge mess of wasted potential."
475,"Went into this very excited, came out very disappointed. The worst avengers film, possibly the worst marvel film. It was incredibly boring the only reason I'm giving it a 3/10 is the battle scene that was the only entertaining part of the film. I don't get all the hype around this film. The visual effects are amazing (just like all marvel films). It tries to be emotional, but it's very predictable and it failed to do that for me. 3/10 very overrated."
476,I had very high hopes from this one. but it was a big dissapoinment. They should have come up with better idea than time travel and no action at all. Last 8 mins action is not enough.
477,First any movie with time travel is just broken to begin with but Captain Marvel is too OP. Every 5 minutes I was thinking that's dumb. Not worth watching.
478,"I was mostly excited going to see this film when it came out in cinemas, however upon viewing I was quite disappointed.While the action scenes were fun and there were some good laughs throughout, looking back on the film it was 3 hours of my life I will never get back. I was particularly upset with the use of time travel as a cop-out for the snap.I found it a bit self righteous calling out various time-travel films (particularly Back to the Future) for having unrealistic time travel rules when any time travel theories that exist are already paradoxical anyway. Endgame's rules were no exception to this and also were so confusing that the film constantly had to keep breaking them to work. This was not aided by the unnecessarily complicated explanation given by Prof. Hulk.In addition to this, the presence of time travel in the MCU now cheapens any of the sacrifices made in any of the films as the heroes can just go back and pull their friends from an alternate reality (like what they did with Gamora).I was also dissatisfied with the whole premise of the film as being a plot to reverse what was done in the previous film rendering the two movies as pointless. I really enjoyed Infinity War, but found Endgame to be a disservice to the set up it was given.Side note: Though I have seen all of the films except for Hulk, Capt. Marvel and Far From Home, I am not the biggest MCU fan so my opinion may be partially biased as I do quite enjoy poking fun and nitpicking the films (that is my way of enjoying them). However I tried to keep this as respectful and honest as possible by making sure that all the points I have made are my genuine opinions and not just designed to poke fun at the movie or anyone who enjoyed it.So if you enjoyed the film, I totally respect that and am very happy for you. I just wanted to share my personal opinion."
479,"If I could go back in time, I would not watch the Avengers End Game. If I could go back in time, I would stop 20 minutes before the ending of Infinity War as well. This is a good example of a mediocre script. The production values are excellent, but that is the expectation of any movie."
480,"After all the hype on social media about endgame I would assume I'd enjoy an action packed title but I swear I literally fell asleep halfway into it, (not even joking, I had to watch the other half when I woke up) infinity war was wayy better, more action less drama, hard emotion etc the works, but hey I'm not a fan of superhero movies."
481,"I had a heck of a time watching this movie. I usually like the Marvel films, but this one seems to fall in the pattern that I see way too often these days. At three hours, it is way too long. There is just not enough happening that is capable of sustaining interest in a 3 hour movie. Sometimes, less is more."
482,"It blows my mind that this movie is rated so highly for how bad it is. It's OK, but it's rated as the #40 best movie as of now. It's just very boring and has no re-watch value."
483,"I love science fiction and fantasy, and I have no problem suspending disbelief for purposes of enjoying a good comic book movie, but Endgame just didn't work for me on a couple levels. First, they kill Thanos with little fanfare or drama at what is basically the start of the show. This gets to the whole drama thing, it is all based essentially on a do over, but they try to make it dramatic because they just have ""one chance to get it right"" yet Cap and Tony screw up and just get a do over. So they are fighting to save the world (or half of it anyway) very dramatic, but if this doesn't work they will just do it over, not very dramatic, they beat Thanos at the beginning, again not very dramatic to fight him again.Then there is the time travel logic they use to build up the story that doesn't really work either, you can't change the past, you can just create alternative timelines, but the whole stone thing somehow sidesteps this critical rule ""as long as they put them back in time. And speaking of putting them back, getting them was a major deal involving the whole squad and a lot of risk. How is returning them so much easier? Black Widow ""has to stay dead"" yet Gamora, who died under the exact same circumstances/edict comes back no problem. Fat Thor and smart Hulk didn't help matters. Missed Vision too, everybody else could come back, but not the Viz? Screw that, he is the most interesting character on the whole team.Sorry, don't get all the love, worst Avengers movie yet by far."
484,"Avengers Endgame - what a disappointment. Too long, too boring and too sappy. What was I watching - soap opera?
Low on action, full on drama, corny dialogues about friendship and family.
The hall was supposed to be houseful according to bookmyshow and PVR, bullshit, it had less than 1/4 seats full.
Something very fishy is going on.
Totally anti climactic after Infinity Wars and Thor Ragnarok. The direction Marvel has chosen after Captain Marvel and Now this. Seems like films are statistically driven now, with an eye on how to make the film click - by hook or crook.
Captain Marvel - Woman driven, here too there is one scene clearly pushing that agenda. In the last battle there is a shot where all the woman get together for the final fight - just by chance.
The entire focus for this move was, high on emotions, must have done some calculations for that is what the box office collection tell.If I had got an honest review I would have given this movie a skip, you should too."
485,Ok. So. Endgame yaaay I am hyped goes to watch starts getting impatient. The pace was wayyyy tooo slow. Maybe this is because it is last movie of Phase 3? The movie was slow paced and then at the end everything rushed. IMO Infinith War was wayy better. I think it shouldve been half of the time length of the 3h.
486,Worst movie i ve seen since a long time. It traumatized me by forcing me to stay so long in the cinema. Basically a movie designed for kids up to 4y old. (Mentally as well)If today i would have the option to get shot in the stomach 99 times or to go to the cinema to watch avengers i would have 99 problems but going to the cinema wouldn t be one.DON T BUY THE HYPE!!!!! OR AT LEAST TORRENT ITThis rating represents the opinion of 2 persons.
487,"I honestly don't understand what people liked in this movie. There was too much inspiration from a third class chick flick, with completely useless emotional scenes from super heros who don't really inspire any emotions. Acting and dialogs were also terribly executed. The movie could have easily be completed in half an hour without losing any content."
488,"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.
TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie"
489,"Love the series, but thi movie was just annoying. The characters reaction to urgency had us fast forwarding a lot. :("
490,There is nothing in this film for an adult to enjoy. It's a total children's film. Don't know what else I can say.
491,"I feel the same as most ppl in the reviews, time travel plot? Professor Hulk? Fat/emotional Thor? Killing The best Villan off in the first 20 mins? Strange girl power moment? Plugging future Marvel films/Boxsets? It's like GOT season 8 all over again. Second time is a much better watch, the expectation is gone which really helps. It's not bad. Not infinity war 2 however."
492,"As the title says. You know you have reached a dead end when you introduce time travel to resolve things. It works fine in shows that focus on it like Quantum Leap or Sliders but its usually a sign that you cant write worth a darn if you bring it into something else. That and alternate universes etc. They have been done to death and back and are just a plot device to overcome bad writing.So anyway, I still gave this a 5 because the CGI and fight scenes were fun. Unfortunately, that is about all there is to say about this movie. It was pretty hollow. The only source of comedy came with the introduction of smart hulk who was just funny conceptually more than anything else. Otherwise, I actually thought that this movie made all the other movies worse because... time travel...Its a shallow movie. Not worthy of its rating in the least."
493,"After watching my brother and my friends were like they all have seen Finest movie of the century but there were lots of potholes and lengthy unnecessary emotions I was disappointed in the beginning when they killed thanos like most weakest villain in mcu and they go back to past collect infinity stone and and stopped thanos to snap I don't know why I am writing this review one of the most boring movie mcu universe unnecessary film for mcu universe they should have stopped on infinity war, Infinity war infinite time better than endgame..."
494,I dont like the movie. It doesn't deserve to be in top 100 movie.
495,"More than 3h of ""yes sure..."" BS. The franchise is at its end and CGI won't rescue it."
496,"This movie sets up the rules of time travel - the no paradox approach, where whatever you do in the past have already been done at lead to this point - but forgets it midway: Thanos jumps ahead of events that have not happened yet.
Go and watch Dark instead. That's actually interesting and plays in a different league of science, storytelling, everything.Oh, and the ever moving cameras. PLEASE STOP ALWAYS MOVING THE CAMERAS, I beg you, Hollywood. It's annoying, it's not how people see, it's cheap. Take a look at old, classic cinematography instead and make the cuts simply better."
497,"Worst Marvel movie made. For those of you who gave it anything higher than a 3 are either knuckleheads or don't know anything about the Avengers. CGI was cool, only reason I gave a 3. All the hype of Cpt. Marvel and she is in the movie for 5 minutes. Worse than Infinity War, which also sucked. Movie made no sense."
498,"As always this movie had great acting and special effects.
I went to the theatre with my friends, sat down with some chips and coke and started watching...
Then the movie started it had some suspense at the beginning, then fifteen minutes in, I realised that this movie was more bland than a dish on Kitchen Nightmares, mediocre at best. The only fresh and fun thing was fat Thor.
Then the final battle came, and my disappointment continued, the whole MCU came to defend The world against Thanos and his army. And the disappointment continued. Suddenly Capitan America became wordy of Thor's hammer, Capitan Marvel turned into a lesbian, for some reason, Iron man forgot to upgrade his suit, and Loki stole the Tesseract, again, and The Hulk was more useless than Italy in WWII. This movie was worse than GOT season 8!
Worse 10 euros ever spend!"
499,Garbage that fits with today's over blown pc generation of over thinking and numbing lifeless endings. Not a fan of these films and this was the worst considering the waste of talent and plot that just seemed to be about over the top nonsense. The sad thing is how many people fall into the trap of thinking this movie has any validity of reality!!
500,"Im a very critical movie watcher, so if you are not prepared for nitpicking than please understand my review might not be for you. I enjoyed the movie very much, now lets get to the juicy things I wish the movie had done instead. I know its a Disney movie but that doesn't stop me from wanting to see the most epic comic book movie in history if they changed a few things.1. Thanos never kills anyone(besides loki *maybe*) A. SOME people died in this movie (black widow, Iron Man) but they died from heroic sacrifice. Not from Thanos's power. B. I wanted to see Thanos kill Iron man, or Thor, or Any major character. After the movie 3-5 people should have been dead and your like, What now? But instead almost everyone is alive and you can already see the next movies coming out soon. C. In Infinty War Thanos was the biggest baddest guy in the universe, In this movie the avengers are fighting a new Thanos that isnt even that bad ass or cool or anything, thats why he should have killed someone on the battle field like Captain America. To show the strenght and might and danger of Thanos. I like Capstain America's happy ending, but I would have liked it even more if he died to Thanos and Hulk or Thor got revenge, which leads to point 2.2. Thor, Hulk, Capetian America, Iron man, Captain Marvel, or Someone should have killed Thanos in battle on the battle field. Imagine if Captain America died by Thanos hands, and HULK goes into a rage and kills Thanos. Then they take the glove off of his and and do the snap. Then Hulk would be a legend and that would be part of the history forever. Hulk Thanos killer, or Thor the Asgaurd god who killed Thanos. 2A. Instead legends like Thor and Hulk are reduced to side comic characters like the antler Gaurdian of the galaxy lady and rocket racoon. Thor even leaves at the end with the Racoon and Gaurdians, and seems to join their crew and set up for the next comedy action movie..... which is funny and great. But I would have preferred the fighter warrior Thor. The Thor that opened a sun onto himself to reforge his hammer. What the heck happened to the Thor who almost killed Thanos In Infinity war? why did we get this comedy relief fat Thor. Yes he is really funny. But I would have preferred him to fight toe to toe with Thanos, instead of make a few jokes. 2B. HULK got the same treatment as a comic/clown. He can kill Thanos. Hulk literally never got mad and angry and started smashing people. He never smashed Thanos or fought him at all in this movie.3. To many emotional scenes, Hawkeye walking his dog...etc. Tony Stark doing a pov youtube video documentary about if he wants to fight or not. These are the greatest fighters in history in the greatest fight against their greatest enemy. Show some more fight scenes. Show some intensity and tension. They went back in time so easy and got the stones so easy as they are cracking jokes. Black widow soul gem scene was good, but they still needed some fight scenes. Someone should have died to retrieve one of the stones. or should have got stuck in time or something.4.Fake gauntlet. Why did Thanos go to the Asgard holy weapon site to make that gauntlet, the only thing that can hold the infinity stones, if iron man can just hold the stones on his robot arm. I thought the Gauntlet was special and magical. I dont like that scene at all. Why couldn't someone just kill Thanos and then they use the gauntlet to snap after they pull it off his dead hand. They wanted it to be more tense, but it just created a plot hole and just breaks the reality and power of the gauntlet and the stones and all of the lore.5. So my main gripe with the movie even though I enjoyed it for funs sake, was that no real consequences happened. Only Theoretical consequences people sacrificing themselves for the greater good etc boring storyline. I wanted Thanos the biggest bad guy in comic books, to have done something of weight. In the end he did nothing. He should have killed Iron man. He should have killed Captain America or Thor, or Scarlett witch or all three of them. His plan got completely foiled and he personally did no damage. weak. Thanos is weak, he couldn't kill one measly earth defender.6, Captain marvel flying around for no reason doing no damage, weak.Infinity war had more tension, more fights, and more deaths in battle. I am highly disappointed from this great movie. Highly Dissapointing Great Movie"
501,"Nothing special about this movie, its over rated there was no surprises in the whole film"
502,"I watched this movie for a second time and didn't realize before half way through that I already had seen it.
I grew up reading comics and I enjoy good movies based on such - but this is not a good movie.
Iron man, Guardians and Ant man - all have great movies and the start of Avengers also brought something exciting.
Endgame is boring, lacks imagination and feels like a neverending wait for it to end. The main problem is that they try to make it epic and over the top righteous - and succeed cutting all emotional ties to the audience.
See it so you can talk of it, but prepare to fast forward, fall asleep or a me - forget that you have seen it."
503,They shy away from the true aftermath expected from half the universe dying. Only Thor's regret was believable. The entire time heist plot was bull and boring to watch. The battle was hugely overcrowded nothing caught my eye like wow look at that. They should not have had the whole Dr Strange bull that there was only one way. There were many ways it could have been avoided. Felt nothing.
504,"A 3 hours Marvel film with 2.5 hours of drama, 15 mins of actions and 15 mins of something else.. seriously?Their logic didn't make any sense.Besides, what they did to Thor was brutal."
505,Way to long of a movie probably could of cut an hour out of it and it wouldn't have made a difference. Probably one of the worst Avenger movies I've seen. Very slow to get to the point and it do not hold my interest or my husband's.
506,"Disappointing, Emotional BS, Family BS, Random Moments that try to be funny, Overpowered Women, Underpowered Thor, Boring 1st Hour & many more....This movie was a disgrace to the entire franchise. Watching the avengers & other marvel movies that all lead up to this.... Hell No!To all reading this review Do Not watch Marvel movies like I did; all those expectations lead to this... :-{
Investing all those hours & emotional energy & it all went down the drain.I give the movie a 4 for the action scenes & the VFX, the rest was just Underwhelming."
507,"I'm an Avengers fan but to me, Endgame was the worst part. Infinity war was much better. Even the action scenes are incomparable. Only 4 stars!"
508,"Took an age to build up to the final battle where the solution merely involved jumping on Thanos and steeling the stones. You don't need world war 3 first to get to that point.Anyhow, hats off to the filmmakers for making so many people want to watch yet another mediocre story hidden behind shinny cgi."
509,"Expect everything from this movie, because that*s what it's trying to be. It wants to be fan service. It wants to be an epic finale. It wants to be a beginning and stepping stone for the remaining heroes.It ends up being a collection of references and borderline fan fiction with a short 15 minute break for the kind of movie that you should expect from this franchise.Unfortunately you will be just exausted at that point by what retroactively seems like a bunch of ""Last week on Avengers"" clips. It's not even terrible, even though it's obvious filler material, it's often funny or heartwarming, but you see the minutes and hours walk by and it just. doesn't. go. anywhere. Up until the aforementioned 15 minutes, and those are painful since they remind you of the movie that you could have and should have seen up until this point.Followed by yet another 30 minutes of an ongoing funeral where the brand is literally and figuratively burries itself.Avengers managed to overstay their welcome, but I will still remember them fondly. But I also won't really miss them after this."
510,"OK they did all this work to not mess up the timeline. Which oddly enough was brilliant. Boring as hell, but brilliant. It all works out except Steve Rogers goes back in time and selfishly SCREWS THE ENTIRE TIMELINE UP!!!!!! Captain America would never do this. The first two hours are BORING. Then it gets good with the entire battle scene which is completely destroyed by Steve Rogers being a selfish ass! He was my favorite character until this. The writers really F'ed this up. I'm only giving 4 stars and 3 of those are because the battle scene was good. Other than that? Movie sucks a fat one. MCU has jumped the shark. Fun while it lasted."
511,"Hope 'endgame' means no more sequels. Story is so thin, the dialogues so silly and the melodrama painful that even the fine actors are not given a chance to show their abilities. What a marvellous waste ot time."
512,You can't put a rat that saves the heroes and call it best movie
513,"There are numerous plot holes, and honestly, it has been overhyped. Is it worth the watch? Yes, once. But the childish humor and ridiculous plot do not make this a 10/10 or anywhere close."
514,"Corny lines, Story line sluggish and lazy. Talks about causality in time travel, then goes and kills one self from the past. I think this was made to make money and nothing else."
515,"Three hours wasted, was about as good as declawing my dog and at least I like the dog. The storyline was terrible, and for many blatantly obvious reasons made no senses, to make matters worse it seemed to have more holes in it, than my old gym socks. Yes I know all the good guys weren't going to make it, everyone knew that, I actually hoped a few wouldn't make it, and that's not what I care about, this movie was rubbish it labored three hours to get to the point of dead good guys/bad guys then victory and bang happy ever after for two minutes then over. This is going straight in the never watch again list, unless trapped on a plane in which case fingers crossed for a parachute, but will jump without one."
516,To long could have cout out 1 hour and it wouldn't have mad a diffrence. They ruined Thor and Hulk. Nobody died except for Cpt. A and Tony. Captain Marvel was just stupid. Thanos should have atleast killed somebody like ironmans wife or Tom holland the inferior spider man. Only good parts are when thanos punches Captain marvel and Captain America picking up Mjölnir.
517,Don't believe the reviews. I suspect it's people paid to do positive reviews. Either that or I saw a different movie! Nothing much happens for 2 hours. There was no plot to speak of and i could have written better dialogue! The soundtrack is the best thing about it seriously
518,What a horrible way to end. A waste of 11 years. So sad.
519,"So, i loved ""infinity war""and I was hoping for something better, that would blow my mind.
After 2 hours i was checking my watch, that bever happened to me at an ""Avengers"" movie.
I went out of the cinema demandibg my 3 hours back.
This movie is a 6 at best, i gave it 1 just to balnce the stupid high 8,9 rate."
520,"I don't understand the hype behind this movie or most of the Marvel movies. I went into this movie open minded after hearing everyone tell me how great it was and after the first hour and a half I was bored. It's almost as if Marvel has started to make comedy movies rather than super hero action movies. Now I am fine with having some comic relief but holy hell. For starters, they completely ruined the Hulk and Thor who are two of the most powerful and captivating characters. I don't understand why they just decided to have the Hulk become a big joke of a character but they did. I thought his main thing was that he was angry all the time which made him way more interesting than a science nerd but ok I guess so. Then they decide to make Thor just a slob that drinks beer and plays fortnite. I saw Korg holding the controller and thought to myself ""if they are playing fortnite this movie is embarrassing"" and believe it or not they were. I could not believe it when I saw what they did to Thor. The God of Thunder and King of Asgard has a mid life crisis after losing to Thanos when he has 1000 years of being a battle tested warrior and is now an overweight bum and is that for the ENTIRE MOVIE.
The other thing in this movie that made me mad was that they tried to force all of these character relationships onto the viewer. I do not care about Hawkeye and Black Widows weird romance/friendship because as far as I can see, they are both kinda useless in the grand scheme of things. Honestly they both probably should have died in the first avengers but we will blame plot armor for that one. I also do not care about captain America and Peggy's relationship or Tony Starks new family that is a thing when the movie just jumps ahead in tome 5 years. This is probably because I think Pepper is one of the most annoying movie character of all time.
The last thing I will rant about is the fighting. For a 3 hour movie you would expect to see some cool fight scenes but no. We got a bunch of fast moving shots and a lot of different characters running with the gauntlet. To make matters worse, Thanos was just so not intimidating in the slightest. It's almost as if he stood 0 chance and everyone knew it. Overall this movie was 3 hours of superheroes sitting around telling some dumb jokes that people think are hilarious for some reason and then winning the battle with little trouble.
Other problem with the movie:
1. Bucky should have gotten Captains shield
2. Time travel? Really. Stark figures out time travel in 30 minutes after 5 years of sitting around and it works without any problem besides when captain America fought his past self and somehow nobody in the building saw it.
3. Thor joining the guardians is cool but also WTF
4. Captain Marvel should have just stayed with the avengers and try to fix the problem rather than run off to other planets and come back at very convenient times. Total cop out
5. The hulk should have fought thanos. Total blown opportunity"
521,"This movie was a huge disappointment after the last one. Way too long, no character development, and a foregone conclusion. I'd say skip it but if you're an avengers fan, you have to see the ending. In that case, wait for video and don't expect much and you'll be fine."
522,"Watched all the Avengers series where there were lots of actions from the beginning of the film to end of the film but End Game version is so much different than the past onceStart is so slow that - If you are not a hard core Avengers lover you will just sleep in theatreAction is there but up to a extend, last 15 min is unnecessary shown in filmDisappointed as the expectation was quite higher because of past performances"
523,As we all know infinity war was so good and we all expected that endgame will be a movie higher than infinity war standards but it failed instead it was slow and depressing movie expect the last 30 mins of the movie.
524,"I think I'm done with being a super hype fanboy of the MCU as well, but not for the same reasons as you. I'm not burnt out on superhero movies, I'm not walking off after a grand finale just for the sake of doing so and I'm not letting one character in Captain Marvel end my love for a franchise. Avengers Endgame is what essentially ruined the entire franchise of movies for me. You're probably thinking that I'm severely exaggerating, and to be honest you'd probably be right to think so, but having that lazily-written, poor finale of a movie be the culmination to which TWENTY ONE other movies have lead up to is just despicable in my eyes. I know that statement sounds very emotionally driven, and it is, but it's just part of my disappointment.You don't have to agree with me, you don't even have to read this if you don't want to or don't care, but I just really want to say why I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes' 95% and the over-3000 IMDb users who voted 10/10.After the heart-wrenching set up provided to us in Infinity War by none other than the same Russo Brothers who brought us this lame finale, I had high expectations...EXTREMELY high expectations. But after 21 other movies through ten years set up this movie, I almost feel entitled to those expectations and I stand by them. If you haven't been able to pick up on my blatantly negative tone towards the movie already, it didn't meet those expectations.Let's start with the elephant in the room, the time travel aspect. I'm going to be as outright and as honest as I can possibly be. That was pathetic and disrespectful to Infinity War, I felt personally offended by that story writing (or lack thereof). I get that Marvel movies are far from realistic, but generally, even with all the magical powers and very advanced technology, there is some sort of logical flow that these tend to follow (unlike Once Upon a Time hahaha) and most of the things that happen are explainable (ex. all the magic powers have some sort of understandable explanation/origin). That's a bold statement by me, I know, but I stand by it. Anyways, all that logic was thrown out of the window with time travel. I read a comment that said, ""Time traveling is RARELY done right; when I see time traveling shenanigans that is clearly for plot convenience"". That basically expresses my feelings about time travel, especially in this movie. It is so far from reality that it's almost comprehensible and thus it DOESN'T WORK! Yes, magical gauntlets and infinity stones are far from reality too, but those at least have some kind of constant consistency (well until this movie anyways --> Thanos destroys that which makes up and controls the universe without destroying the universe itself...that's possible?). There is no consistency or logic to time travel. This is what I think of directors saying when I see them using time travel: ""The characters couldn't beat the villain the first time around because they weren't strong enough, so let's just reverse everything and let them try again instead of thinking of a much more creative way of having them ultimately win."" And COME ON, if they're gonna use time travel, AT LEAST use the *Time Stone* instead of some alternate realm where you can apparently navigate both time and space (which Tony figured out in like 2 minutes and we never got a proper explanation on how he did it, because there is no feasible one) to when/wherever you want because your past is your future and your present is your past or whatever, and it is a different length of time than reality and what not. Also, when the Ancient One brought up different realities, I was pulling my hair...like really?Now that I dumped time travel, I want to talk about arguably the most bothersome part of all the movie, the treatment of our beloved characters. I'll discuss the worst ones.Thor: You've gotta be kidding me with this. Let's reflect on the old Thor. In Thor 1, we saw his willingness to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Very selfless and heroic of him (I loved Thor 1 by the way). In Thor 2, we didn't see much other than his power. In Thor 3, we saw his character development to discover his ""true self"" and his extreme perseverance. In Infinity War, he was TRULY a god through holding back a star, almost killing Thanos etc. Now let's get to the new Thor. A drunk depressed wimp. That's a disgraceful ruination of his character.Hulk: I'm kind of tired at this point so I'll keep this short a sweet. A character who was defined by his dual, Dr. Jeckel/Mr. Hyde-like personality (whose other half refused to come out in Infinity War) was turned into one big joke with BARELY an explanation. They took the point of Hulk and threw it out the window. And where's that Hulk-Thanos rematch at?Hawkeye: A man with a great heart (shown through his willingness to sacrifice his life in Age of Ultron) turned into a despicable murderer (and accomplished what by doing it?) because his family was murdered. I didn't like that.Nebula: Killed her past self but she still exists. Niceeeeeeee.Ant Man: Brought out of quantum realm by a convenient rat. Plot convenience really shines here.Props to you if you're still reading this by the way.Plot holes are another glaring issue for me as well. I have a few main ones I want to discuss.Thanos' power. Got wrecked by Thor with Stormbreaker in Infinity War when he HAD all the Infinity Stones and struggled in some other points in the movie, but quite flawlessly beat Thor with Stormbreaker and Mjolnir, Cap and a seemingly advanced Iron Man with nothing but a sword. That sword is more powerful that a 6-stone infinity gauntlet? And don't even try to tell me that in Infinity War Thanos didn't want to kill anyone. Even without killing them, he destroyed some people in the Battle of Wakanda and he was quite willing to kill Iron Man. Not to mention that he clearly tried to stop Thor but couldn't. Thanos had been evidently portrayed to do whatever he needs to do to get his way.Captain America holding Thor's hammer. That's fine. But how can he summon lightning with it? The hammer doesn't summon the lightning unless it's welder needs to be able to do so. Thor is the god of thunder, not him.Iron Man's gauntlet. Thanos had to go to a magical planet to get it specifically made for him, but Stark tech could do it all along? Thanos couldn've easily stolen Stark tech if that was the case and even so, did none of the other planets Thanos conquered have tech comparable to Stark tech? Also, the way Stark so quickly ""pick-pocketed"" (for lack of a better word) Thanos of those stones was super cheesy.Avengers building got bombed BADLY but somehow everyone lived.At this point my head is hurting so I just want to briefly mention the few points of the movie I loved to not seem like a hater. I'm not going in depth because there are an abundance of praises for this movie on the internet.
-The last fight scene when everyone came back was beautiful (minus the plot holes)
-I actually liked that Cap was worthy to hold the hammer, just not summon lightning
-The emotional intensity of Tony getting saved in the beginning (although Captain Marvel's space taxi idea was a bit corny)
-Cap passes on his legacy, but I'm devastated that it wasn't Bucky.If you're STILL reading, thanks for hearing me out. At least I still have Star Wars to look forward to. I'm a big Star Wars fan too. For me, Star Wars is not at all ruined by the new trilogy and I liked The Last Jedi. I have high hopes for The Rise of Skywalker and the entire new trilogy would be a success for me if this last episode is done right.And I didn't actually think this movie was a this bad of a star rating, I just want ot balance it out"
525,"I show this movie two time store is good but the end is very very bad
This's the badest end from all marvel"
526,The story of time travel is overused in soo many films -> I hate it....
527,"Writting about time traveling is always difficult. But there's been so many inconsistencies in this movie that I lost Interest after 1hour watching. The writting was so poorly done that I felt no emotions and got bored at some point.
Infinity war were so well done that I'm really surprised that the last Avengers movie turned down like this."
528,"What a waste of 3 hours. Too long, boring and ridiculous."
529,"Endgame is such a bad conclusion for the epic Avengers saga. Everything sounds predictable and even boring, as the firsr 2 hours of movie is a non-sense fanservice for HQ readers. All the hype the movie had relied only on Marvel franchise, because the movie, at best, is mediocre, even compared to the previous one. There are a few cringeworthy momments to take note: ""professor"" Hulk 4th wallish jokes, the time travel machine itself, fat drunk Thunder God Thor and the worst one: ""She's not alone"" empowered heroines against the purple male patriarch. Unless you are a fanboy or fangirl, watching this will be 3 hours less in your lifespam."
530,"This is made by people who do, for people who do, and this movie itself, does, love the MCU. You can think of it as a TV show finale. After 21 episodes that are all feature length. And before you can even say ""oh no those are all terrible"", this immediately proves itself to be an exception to that rule. Where the equally masterful Infinity War was almost one long action climax, this is less about fights. Which doesn't mean it doesn't have any. Or that they're anything less than excellent. And this film is definitely never boring. This focuses on character exploration. Every member of the original Avengers team, and a handful individuals that aren't, all get significant depth. I remain one of the few people who argue that Age of Ultron did deliver that, albeit in small concentrated format. This easily tops that. Everyone is pushed into a situation new to them. The trailers hint at some of these, whilst leaving others as incredible surprises. Make sure you avoid spoilers before watching this.This picture moves fast and packs a lot into its not quite lean running time. In other words, it's directed by the Russo Brothers. The length is justified. I wouldn't cut anything from this. The emotional moments don't feel sappy. The countless callbacks and references don't feel like they're just there to make you feel good for paying attention to all that lead to this one. The acting shows just how well all of these performers understand the characters. And the screenplay does the same for the writers. The effects are astonishing, yet again getting us to care about individuals that we know are all CG. It uses the varied skills, equipment and the like, of the unique heroes and villains, creatively. This delivers deeply satisfying closure. It truly is a conclusion. It's not trying to get you back to the theatre for the next adventure. The few currently confirmed entries into this franchise don't need hyping, anyway. Spider-Man with Mysterio? Another Black Panther story? The unfairly fired James Gunn returning to round out the trilogy of the Guardians of the Galaxy? Solo Black widow, *finally*? More Dr Strange? Shang-Chi, The Eternals, Blade? Keep 'em coming.I recommend this to everyone who's taken this entire journey. And if you're someone who's skipped some, or held off on this series up to this point, this is an excellent reason to address that. Unless they're simply not to your liking. This is not going to change that. It's not meant to. 10/10"
531,"Nope. If your into mindless garbage this is for you. Seen the death of Iron man coming for the past five years. literally been telling my girlfriend to prepare for it for the past five years because marvel is just so damn predictable. Thanks for proving me right guys. plus it's the same 4 storylines for EVERY movie. Very tiring. Only reason I went is because my girlfriend is a marvel fan.
You might say I'm a little biased since I'm DC all the way but I still enjoy a good superhero story no matter who makes it. Also, time travel all of a sudden? Fat Thor? Come on guys. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is cause of Jeremy Renner. Great performance. And the graphics were good. Except Thanos. Still looks like he was hand drawn in at the last minute. Just like in infinity. Check it out. You might like it. Probably will cause the general public disagrees with me and falls for this crap time and time again but me? Just nope"
532,Endgame is a movie that makes the audience cry and laugh through the entire three hour long run time. It's laughably bad and sadly disappointing.
533,"Is it just me that thinks that iron man death was pushing too far, like how many others could do what he did and not die??"
534,"A fat Thor and a hippie dippy Hulk? Please. These moviemakers have very little loyalty to the original franchise, and no idea how to transform the persona of the original characters to the big screen. They basically bought the rights to a franchise and then formed the characters the way they wanted in order to tell a story they wanted to tell.Really enjoyed watching ""superheroes"" become mental cases and continually get their buts kicked in battle. How about making Thanos just a little more vulnerable and concluding everything with a good old battle to the end rather than introducing a bunch of sentimental goobly gop? It's a superhero movie for pete's sake!"
535,"I think End game is non sense
How could they destroy the story by missing with time !
killing Thanos erase infinity war so End game is never happen
and I wonder about Captain Marvel ..half the univ disappear and she was to busy or did not notice tell she had a missed call ..and once more she come to do nothing here ! come on ! I waited too long for this movie to understand why the ""heroes "" of infinity war give up willingly infinity stone to thanos however the know what he will do! but now never mind it is just a movie no story not a big deal
p.s I liked what happen to ironman"
536,"Everyone built this movie up, telling me it was amazing. They made it sound like it was the best one ever made...but I was completely disappointed.It's was long and stretched out, they had to put things in there that didn't have any business being in there, and in the end I just felt like it was a big ball of confusion.I was very disappointed in this one and so was my husband. Infinity Wars was great LOVED it but this one wasn't great."
537,"I have seen Godfather, Shawshank Redemption, Dark Knight, and all others imdb top movies or top 20 movies and they are one of the best movies.
I was very excited to see the endgame and when I saw it, i was surprised to see how boring this movie is and it was waste of time. Infinity war was much much better than end game. This movie doesn't even deserve a rank in IMDB and still people are mad for this movie."
538,Basically an animated movie. 99% CGI and poor writing. As overhyped as the last ten marvel films or so
539,"This movie was the best movie I have ever seen. Visuals, the actresses and actors, and plot. Everything linked up. I love this film and would recommend it to anyone."
540,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.
Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out."
541,When you kill off two of the main characters the ones that weren't sjw and promote social Warrior BS I'm done. This was my end game don't waste your money your time those are two things it's hard to get back. And some sisters in the Marvel Universe none of us can go back in time what a joke.
542,"The film claimed to be super duper buster blockbuster hit after the movie Infinity War, and kept that promise also.
Some Critics and Peoples said that the Movie is Overrated, but I can say clearly that they will definitely be DCEU fans who are saying like that for Endgame. They are just trying to undercast the grossing collection of worldwide.
Anyway, The movie is for those people who saw MCU last 22 films and awaited for the conclusion as the twist was Thanos in their every movie.
Feeling Sad for RDJ... 😭😭😭"
543,"Yes I gave this movie a ten ... like i gave to Good Fellas or Casino or Aliens or Terminator 2.
Why ? Because this movie is one of the best actions movies ever... CGI ... Actors... Story Directors ... are incredible.
Yes it cost 360.000.000 USD ... the most expensive movie ever ... but at least they made an incredible Superhero Movie ... Marvel understood from the beginning how to make an entertaining film. I like Zack Snyder but the DC Comics movies are just trying it to make it serious ...
Come one we want fights and funny conversations like in the comics ... The Story might be not 100 % in line or believable yeah give me a break we are talking about Superheros here ... they can do anything :)
I am now waiting for the 4 Bluray Box for the Avengers and the 3 Bluray Boy of Captain America ...
For me it ended now .... Great experience ... and I think it will take mabe some decades before they can do somethng like this again."
544,Really.. I don't like the fact that iron man died and will never come after this. But it was good ending.
545,"To all the people who rated this 1 or 2 stars...WHAT MOVIE did you watch? Just to hear Cap say ""Avengers Assemble"" alone makes this epic...remember the question Mr. Hand asked his class when so many failed the test? This is a great film, action, humor, emotion...all on display..."
546,What was that. A fat useless thor. Bits of old stuff. An ant. A stupid looking not the hulk.. I give up. That was awful.. All hype. 3 hours of my life I can't get back... You wait it will dawn on you... This was just a bad film.
547,"Poor plot, dialogue and characterisation. Don't bother"
548,These guys putting up fake reviews! End game is a waste of time and money! Weak story line! Hardly any action for thanos! Many things in the movie unexplained how they happened! Thor made a laughing stock! Why why! Big let down!
549,"I absolutely love the marvel universe. Reason being, is that although it is magical, powerful, and well super, the movies have still found a way to somewhat be believable as if in our own reality. However, this movie goes beyond that with time travel, and it ruined it for me. Also, I believe that someone sat down and said lets find a way to ruin every character that we have spent the past 11 years building up and making people love them. Same your time and money, watch Infinity War and make up your own conclusion. No matter what you imagine, it is bound to better than End Game."
550,"It's way too long. The beginning is painfully slow paced. Ok I get it, everybody is depressed, etc but seriously it just didn't work. Also the way they find out how to travel in time... It was just too simple. Also where were Captain Marvel at the end? Why was she away? Just becasue the fight would have been too short with her from the beginning?To be honest, this was lame."
551,"Thor is playing Fortnite. Thats all what is cool at Avengers Endgame. And it has been shot very well: colours are good, effects are good but Captain Marvel is annoying me"
552,"I expected an action movie with a real battle.
Unfortunately it was just a loong and boring exchange of lines.."
553,"When Infiniti War ended by Thanos winning, I hated it. Though I new that this year's Avengers Endgame is going to be going back to the past etc. But never thought they will end it by Iron Man's death and the Captain's retirement. Who's going to save the world when another Thanos is born in the Universe?
Thank You."
554,Just a basic superhero movie. 3 hours but not much going on.
555,"Everybody, I mean everybody was in this movie. Endgame is basically an epic superhero movie. It will be interesting to see if they can ever top this on this kind of scale.I regret not seeing Avengers in the theater. This is the type of movie that needs to be watched on the big screen. I avoided it because I thought it was hype and only for the most diehard fans. However I think moviegoers who aren't really into this genre can appreciate Endgame.It's got a lot of fun action. The action scenes were good the movie has some events which kept it from becoming predictable. There were many stories which kept it exciting. I liked the bond between the hero's. The jokes were funny and it really felt like a family.The visuals looked amazing. From the spaceships to the planets the CGI was flawless. I loved it. It showed that the creators put their heart and soul into making this movie. Avengers Endgame is an absolute treat."
556,"Forget people who say that this movie is crap,because the way I see it avengers endgame is the most entertaining movie in history so far."
557,Great movie. Great ending. Great actors. Miss Iron Man💔 the most
558,"I loved this movie. I think its the best movie in Cinematic history. Clearly the best MCU movie.About the movie.
A culmination of 21 movies going back 11 years. Staring pretty much everyone. The best actors of our generation. Thanos the evil Mad-titan obsessed with collecting all Infinity stones: Soul Stone, Power Stone, Time Stone, Space Stone, Reality Stone and Mind Stone. Thanos defeated our heroes, wiped out half of all life in the universe and escaped. This movie is about the result of that defeat and how our heroes will respond.Why the movie is great:
The reason this movie is great is because it's the pinnacle on top of all the other movies in the MCU. It takes clues, places people and stories from all the other movies. You get to see the real human toll on the characters from their defeat. The defeat really wounded them and you get to see that. This makes the film more emotional, real and not disposable. The three act break down like this - First Act - The aftermath of Infinity War, Act 2 - Time Heist, and Act 3. Final Battle. The movie is interesting, mind bending, nostalgic, smart, funny, emotional, entertaining, at times violent, epic and in the end the most satisfy conclusion you could possible get from a movie experience. Watch this movie and you will realized you watched something that will never be replicated again. Maybe not even by the MCU. This not even Movie Magic - it's Movie Sorcery. What Marvel crafted here is nothing short of amazing. It's a movie anyone can enjoy. No matter who you are or where you are. Young, Middle aged, old. Every denomination. If you watch this movie be prepared to cry. Don't bring tissues, bring a towel, a beach towel."
559,"This film has been the build up of 11 years of which 21 movies have structured a saga of enthralling movies to pay off for this one film. And I have to say this movie was amazing. The way the movie starts off shows that this is going to be a wild ride from beginning to end. This film starts off with a reflection of the events of infinity war as we see a take of death like few other superhero movies like no other. The avengers are seen as hopeless as we see the impact of the snap on everyone's lives. When ant man comes in he is clueless of what's going on so he finds the avengers as they start the search for a plan to bring everyone back. The avengers reassemble which is akin to when they assemble the avengers in the 2012 original. It is perfect and reflects the movie as it tends to tribute famous scenes in the mcu there is a clear difference as now they are depressed as a lot of the film shows the characters in peril.
They then go to restore the infinity stones and go back in time to get the stones to bring everyone back. And the adventure there is great, most of the films comedy comes from here which is a good way for a break to tension and revisiting these scenes are amazingly nostalgic and easily will bring a smile to the face of anyone who has seen the other films. The 3rd act includes in my opinion the best final battle of any film as the build up to it in this movie let alone is great. Seeing the before fat and drunk Thor revisiting Asgard, captain America vs captain America, tony stark visiting his father and the return to the battle of New York and the start if guardians of the galaxy are amazing scenes with Thor in this movie getting some great scenes as well as nostalgic scenes in tribute to the other films and how they linked them together.The conclusion holds in my opinion the best final battle scene ever in a movie. After hulk snapping his fingers he brings back all the deceased avengers bit not before thanos arrives as he was now here for revenge to get the stones back. A fight ensues as the avengers fight the black order and thanos' army. Thor ,iron man and captain America take on thanos as they again begin to lose but soon as another fan moment captain America picks up thors hammer as hinted at in age of ultron as the audience me included erupted in an applause. I should mention that the action in the film is amazing as people say that there is not to much action and is a bit prolonged with dialogue but the dialogue is essential to the plot as well as dramatic tension. The dialogue is easy to pay attention to and well executed. The action that comes is in long scenes but is done amazingly with fast paced well filmed beautiful cgi. Then after the captain America hammer scene ensues great action but cap and the avengers in peril the words "" on your left cap"" will stay in my head forever as portals opened with all of the heroes coming out Spider-Man black panther scarlet witch doctor strange peter quill and more as they returned in numbers with other armies from there respective films with a army akin to thanos . They stood there in numbers ready for captain America to say the words "" avengers... assemble "" followed by a massive charge with reunions fights and peril with all avengers teaming up in different ways in a scene that still gives me goosebumps today. Finally the ultimate sacrifice from the avengers greatest hero iron man in getting the infinity stones he watches thanos' fear as a response to his line "" I am inevitable "" iron man said ""I am iron man "" the line that capped off the first mcu film iron man as iron man dies with his last words engraved in the audiences minds thanos and his army turn to dust as the avengers mourn the death of the greatest avenger. This is the biggest fan tribute i have ever seen as the movie is on that marvel fans will love 3000 ( sorry for the corny message) but this is one of the greatest blockbusters ever which warrants being the biggest movie of all time. The directors clearly put in years of work for this movie and the movie will leave a legacy on film forever with the clever and well played out deaths of iron man and black widow. This is a must see blockbuster film which warrants all positivity it gets"
560,"Plot holes,time travel plot has always been bad except maybe God of War 2,from the start it was predictable,and sometimes boring.I expected much more,but infortunately,IW is way better.People that put 9s and 10s are just sheep just because its a marvel movie.Thor and Hulk were just f***d up big time.Thanos compared to the masterfull villain that he was in IW,in Endgame seemed dull and generic.The movie had its good moments and scenes,but mostly the ending counted.A shame that this was ""the endgame"",it could be much more"
561,"After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.
I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.
I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.
There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.
The story is average at best with big flaws."
562,"I think film is entering a post-cliche phase, where tired tropes are no longer tired, but are now just accepted tools in a storyteller's toolbox. Certainly we don't need to enforce originality on all forms of art. I adore this film. The entire MCU is a breathtaking opera, and this is the ten-year grand finale. You *do* need to see all twenty-one previous films (in chronological order, hopefully, rather than release order) because taken on its own, ""Endgame"" would be a mishmash, with so many of its call-backs missed.I think film is also leaving the era of the auteur, and entering that of the committee. George Lucas may have been the final straw, as when Disney (the originators of the committee method, from what I can tell) picked up the mantle of that particular franchise, their natural choice to revert to committee decisions dovetailed with everyone's need to get franchises out of one person's control. The MCU was planned out ten years in advance, so that almost at once -- and certainly by Ultron -- ""Endgame"" was being envisioned. Seeing how all the disparate threads meet and find either their resolution or their own inspiring arc, that *in itself* is amazing. Knowing that, in the most crucial moment of the film, we get a familiar call-back to a much earlier part of the MCU, elevates the experience from one of possible bewilderment to outright joy. It's no wonder that other directors would defer this type of blockbuster to the Russos. I only wonder how anyone involved in the creative process could have kept these secrets to themselves for ten years. Knowing that this film makes its predecessor seem like a prelude, and all the other significant milestones in the franchise series seem like blips on a radar, it must have been nerve-wracking to know how all of this turns out and still feed us those ""massive"" revelations in the earlier films.When in the right context, a superlative experience. As good a film experience as you will find. Yes, if you don't gel with the film, it could strike you any number of odd ways, but most people are on board with it being a new classic."
563,"Not sure why so many people are so negative about this movie. The build up of 22 films to this couldn't have been better. I get goosebumps every time they come through the portals. Definitely was sad with Cap and Iron Man, but at some point you have to move on. I truly wanted this to be it, but knowing Feige and how well he's done I am excited for the future of the MCU. My only wish, I hope DC figures itself out. Truly a shame they are wasting the Justice League. It's not a competition, just do it right."
564,My gosh! I laughed. I cried. I was at the edge of my seat. I was glued to my seat not knowing what to expect. I felt a wave of nostalgia ebb and flow. I cried some more.This movie was comprehensive and covered all its bases as far as closing the chapter on all the avengers movies. I also appreciated the balance between the human side of the heroes (showing how loosing everyone effected them) and the fight scenes.The final battle for the infinity stones left me in tears. I thought it was beautiful that captain America was able to wield thor's hammer. And when all the heroes started to materialize out of nowhere I thought I would scream with excitement!I have been a fan of the avengers since day one and heavily invested emotionally in every movie. I'm sad to see it end especially for iron man and captain America (my favorite avenger). I guess now I will wait to see what else marvel has in store for us.
565,"I am stunned by the 10+ years of the MCU and how they were able to bring it all together. Magnificent! However, I hate Captain Marvel. I shudder to wonder what will come of the MCU under her guidance and direction. Black Widow could have/ should have carried the torch. Please don't make any more Captain Marvel movies. I'm begging you."
566,"The only reason why I'm giving this movie a 10 star rating is so both Infinity War and Endgame will have an average weighed out rating of 8 stars so I know everyone will be excited to see both movies. If you haven't seen Infinity War yet, you might want to watch that first before Endgame. After you've seen Infinity War, you're gonna love Endgame even better. Yes, some of the Avengers lives are lost, including Tony Stark's, but this 3 hour movie is a great and perfect for the very last avengers movie. I would recommend it. I think it's still playing in certain theaters, so if your theater is playing it, why not give it a try? It may be a really long movie, but they needed tell the entire story after 1/2 of the world population was lost. This basically tells it all. Thanos eventually gets killed in the end, and everyone returns for one last fight. This last avengers film is perfect for any MCU fan, and also great for certain fans who didn't understand the ending of Infinity War. Get it on DVD if you can! It's a really really great Marvel film!!"
567,This is everything I needed from Endgame.a Lot of people who only watched it for the hype won't be able to enjoy the movie as much as we Marvel do. It gave the characters the ending they deserved and oh my God that last fight scene is a freaking masterpiece. I don't think any movie will ever make me feel the way I felt while watching Endgame in a decade.
568,"It perfectly concluded the movies I have been watching from the beginning. Acting was amazing, story was spectacular, and even though it was darker than most marvel movies, they still incorporated light-hearted comedy."
569,"Brie Larson is simply bad, somewhere between terrible and bland. She's the worst thing about this movies and if it weren't for the not only great but incredibly charismatic cast she'd have definitely tainted this movies. That said, watch it."
570,That's what I call ideal ending. It was really interesting to watch this film from first to the last minute. Film is over 3 hour long however it wasn't too long for me. Yeah Iron Man died. Which was brave from his still I'm not a fan of Iron Man so it was Okay from me. Plot was almost a masterpiece just one detail was really hideous. Why Avengers waited for 5 years to kill Thanos it's just a little bit nonsense. However movie was amazing 9/10. Worth all the awards.
571,"Convenient how they had managed to come up with a time portal disregarding the fact that one of the infinity stones had done just that. This movie is overrated, and pretty much not worth the trip to the theatre."
572,"Just 3 hours of fan service that doesn't really hold up to any scrutiny and doesn't really make sense from an objective standpoint. Obviously all (or most) superhero movies require a suspension of disbelief but they should atleast hold up to their own presumptions. When you start bending the whole narrative structure for some big moments, it just lessens the impact imho. Like for example, some big moments like Grandpa Rogers being there just for the sake of creating an emotional response, even though it massively undermines the character, or the specific choice of 5 years so they can force a 4 year old Morgan into the story for greater emotional impact.I've read a lot of comic books (mostly batman though), and have to hand it to marvel that they have mostly done a better job than DC with the movies, some examples being IW (my favourite MCU movie), Dr. Strange, Winter Soldier, Civil War, Thor Ragnarok, and Black Panther (overrated but still pretty good). Endgame is definitely not in that list, infact so much so that I feel 'Endlame' would've been a more honest and appropriate title.It makes no sense on so many levels, they basically reduced Thanos to a caricature (he had some impact in IW but here he's just a generic evil bad guy who doesn't think much), and time travel is the ultimate cop-out. I could go on with all the flaws and really dumb stuff (how the hell does Laura Barton's cellphone still work 😁, the power levels make no sense, Captain Marvel is conspicuously missing through most of it and why is she not aware of Thanos' genocide across planets etc), but basically the movie was absolute rubbish and takes massive liberties and leaps of logic which the fanboys blindly accept.I've been in the minority when it comes to movies before. I loved the universally panned BvS, though I'll add that the ultimate edition is the only one to watch. Sure it had it's share of silliness like the 'Martha' moment, but that movie got badly burned as a result while none of that seems to be affecting endgame. BvS did try (maybe too hard) to be different, but endgame just comes across as formulaic and deeply flawed.Marvel have at least stayed true to their formula though, while Warner Bros didn't have it in them to stick to the original vision. If they had stuck with Zack Snyder's planned 5-movie arc then we might have got Thanos AND Darkseid in the same year, which might've made both cinematic universes more interesting."
573,"If you want to watch some visual eye candy, forget about character development, and story writing. Even throw away consistency and continuity, then be relieved when its over, then this is for you.Too many fan boys and sheep, following bought and paid for critic reviews. Good films have given way, to basically some pretty images smashed together, and so simplified yet terribly written scripts, that it basically makes no sense in even how the writers wrote it. I'm shocked and applaud at the good reviews for this.P.s. Diploma in film and television, and a degree in creative writing"
574,"Far from what one would expect from a movie with such a budget. Same costumes, predictable storyline, few of the actors even act. Sondtrack? There isn't one. Even the few jokes can't save the day. The whole thing is sometimes even boring! Waste of time and money.Marvel lost me, my family and most of my friends. One star for trying."
575,"Usually I don't bother writing reviews. But .... how can such a thin manuscript and a CGI be allowed to come on the big screen. But if you think this is a movie worth 8.9, then be my guest... I'll watch Godfather in the meantime.."
576,The Best Movie of 2019 (so far!) It was full of twists!
577,"Everything you could want in a sci-fi epic. The action is perfect. The story is perfect by somehow juggling so many character arcs yet giving each and every one of them an emotional punch. The thrils send chills down your spine by culminating every movie in the MCU we all love together in a special kind of epic one can only dream of. The jokes are hilarious; they ring true to the MCU style without taking away from the dark themes on grief and moving on from loss. And the emotional beats are more than just tear jerking, they are sob jerking! Perfectly concludes the story arc of so many characters and the MCU itself by focusing on the characters and the drama of themes such as sacrifice and loss. Not to mention one of the most emotionally filled endings I have ever seen! EPIC!! The movie accomplishes all this by staying very character focused, while not falling into the MCU trap of being too formulaic or not having consequences. OH MAN does this movie take risks and while not all the decisions will work for everybody, they alllll clicked for me resulting in the best movie watching experience I have ever (and likely will ever) had."
578,"I absolutely loved this film. It was wonderful. The CGI, the special effects, the character building, the emotional intensity, and the music are all absolutely amazing. One of my favourite movies ever"
579,"Good movie but not a fan of the time travaling, also i cry watching this movie.
Also i hate Brie Larson in this movie"
580,"I LOVE MARVEL MOVIES but I was kinda disappointed. I was waay hyped after Infinity War(2018) and was wondering what will happen but time travel, c'mon! This is a historal movie most of the people will watch it but this laziness? I am just sad. With adding time travel to universe there will be no excitement anymore, every villian will be able to be defeated using that. And why bother having another Thanos? He is not the Thanos we know, they just threw the character development away. Other than time travel it was GREAT. The final fight was all I asked for, well other than fat thor and Hulk being missing. I mean why didnt Hulk get his rematch with thanos? And the A-Force thing when all the women got together, I wanted to puke. There is a lot of things I hate about this movie and millions of ways that it could be better, but I can't give it a love rating. I guess you can't be a Marvel fan without hatlng Marvel."
581,As a big fan of the MCU I knew I would enjoy this movie. What I didn't realize was how much more Endgame is than just an action movie! There were a LOT of laughs and many more tears than I was prepared for. It was long and overly dramatic in many parts but what a ride!!
582,The movie starts with a recap of Infinity wars (Thanos' snap) and its aftermath but soon shifts to the real motive of the movie. The pace of the movie is perfect with emotional moments throughout. The characters are all well developed. The war scene gives you goosebumps; the theme music is awesome and the VFX freaking good. The ending will make you cry. I would definitely rewatch the movie!
583,"I don't understand why so many suddenly get bent out of shape with all of the time travel problems and paradox issues with this. Holy Cow, you could have carved up 'Terminator' back in 1984 with this kinda stuff...but uh, why? It's a movie!
So, ignore all of the pseudo-scientists and enjoy the movie.
It's great, by the way. The acting is actually very good.
I had a few issues, but nothing to get in a twist about...I think they should have had Zoe's character a little more involved in Thanos' demise. They made it look like that was going to happen, and then it just kinda didn't.
As powerful as Captain Marvel is, they should have just kept her around for the whole plan instead of letting her run off to help other plans.
Thanos should have had a chance to give some kind of farewell speech instead of just disintegrate.
Other than that...no complaints. Top notch special effects. Very emotional at times with the deaths of the main characters.
All in all...very solid."
584,All Marvel's movie is my favourite and this movie is amazing. all parts of avengers movies is good but this is hit boss. what a movie and amazing effects.
585,I like really this movie only thing that I rated 9 stars cuz of begining like Thanos die in first 10 mins I was like whaaat??
586,"While I enjoyed Avengers: Endgame, very much, I sympathize, quite profusely, with the death of Thanos and his people. People need sound-minded leaders lest they become bad - or at the very least are perceived as vile.Thanos was a formidable force. But he was mad.He and his people, subdued, would have made commodious allies to earth in an unraveling universe, once supplied a cure.It takes strength - great strength, to not kill. It is for this reason I admire Superman.I would have preferred an ending were Ironman destroyed the stones (as Thanos did, rendering a part of his body inept), and in doing so, ended his life-dying for earth, and Thanos' people in the process: showing compassion. Albiet the business of returning the stones, it is sacrifice like that that turns a lost people around and helps them see the light-especially when they know the alternative would have been their demise.Earth, now, in the wake of her genocide, has opened herself - in the MCU - to further attacks by other formidable forces, which will no doubt see her as a virulent threat. ""When you wipe out a whole people, word gets around. A just galaxy will inevitably demand accountability.""That said, or written - as it were - Endgame supplies an adequate ending for a blockbuster sequel: A cosmic reprisal of sorts."
587,"There is no way to describe my emotions for that movie , Oh i love it very much , Best 3 hours in marvel's movie , I can't think that there is someone perfect for tony stark, Iron Man except Robert Downey Jr. he was in a great performance for their character and everyone was perfect I really love that movie but I will give it a 9.5/10 , I really loved infinity war more but this was an epic movie , part of the journey is the end , I love you 3000 Iron Man
Thank you Marvel (:"
588,"I'm not that much fan of Avengers series. So, it is kind of difficult for me to review this kind of films. I always see Avengers films are concerning with fights and battles (those kinds of things) but this one is kind of different. It also has some drama. Well, sort of. So, I find it some scenes are a bit boring. But I could watch it. Hence, it's fine.It's so sad to see Iron Man died. But I was touched to see when he sacrificed his life to save a lot of people. And Thanos? He even sacrificed his own daughter just to get the stone. I just wished that Iron Man didn't die. He's sweet guy even though sometimes, he felt like he was better than anyone.Another touchable thing is to see Captain America went back time and married the girl who is he once loved and missed a chance to get her. It's so good to see he finally has a chance to try. Although he became an old man when he went back, but he had great/sweet time with his girl he loves. So, I think it's totally worth it. And that scene is so sweet even though it's so sad to see.There's one thing that I don't understand. About Nebula, past Nebula died. Doesn't mean there's no Nebula anymore? But the present Nebula still exists. If there's no past, how the present exists? 🤔This film ended with sad ending. So, as the one who loves to see happy ending, I'd say it's kind of inferior to the other films which have happy ending. Not all films end with happy ending. That I understand. But I just want to see happy ending. Films are for entertainment anyway. 😁Overall is that Avengers series are always the best even I'm not that fan of it. This film is also a good one too. It gives sweet moments and all. The special effects are good, yet, the fighting scenes are a little bit simple. I want to see more of it and awesome complex fighting scenes. That being said, the current one is doing fine and I've totally enjoyed it."
589,This movie was a great ending to the arc of the franchise. Full of action some comedy and over all great production.
590,"Though I am not the biggest fan of Marvel movies, I can say without a doubt that this had the most epic finale in a movie ever. This was not a movie. This was an experience, an event. This was a fantastic end to a decade of generation-defining super hero movies. This was a movie to remember. Also, the credits were very touching (it may be a weird note, but they are great).Though I will say this movie was a little too long, and Thanos felt a little less emotional real than he was in Infinity War. Also, it was very overwhelming in scope for such a long time, I was actually dizzy afterwards."
591,"It's just a masterpiece, everything is looking pretty good!"
592,"Good things about this movie:
1. Nostalgia
2. Visuals
3. Score
4. Everything Scarlett Witch did
5. Tony with his daughter
6. Cap being worthy of mjolnirBad things about this movie:
.... pretty much everything that isn't stated above. Like,...
1. Story (Generic superhero stuff, nothing special about this movie. Relies heavily on the nostalgia factor)
2. Plot (It has so many plot holes that if I try to write them all down, it would take me a whole day to get through. Everything that is directly or indirectly related to time travel in this movie is just so wrong)
3. Character development (I didn't say characters, I said character development. Please try to understand the difference. Steve and Tony don't go through any permanent physical or psychological transformation until the very end. Fat Thor sucks in this movie. It's as lame as Nick Fury losing his eye to cat scratch. That's just unforgivable. I'm okay with professor hulk though)
4. Jokes (This movie should not have most of those jokes. That just ruins the seriousness and desperation of avengers' mission)
5. Social commentary (probably because of my own biased view on some issues)
6. Supporting characters (boring. Used only for exposition or quipping unfunny jokes in a serious situation)
7. Logical explanation of time travel theory ( I hate the fact that changing the past doesn't change the future. It just takes away the stakes that this movie is supposed to have. It's one of the worst example of lazy writing since The Last Jedi)
8. Tension building ( we already Know that Avengers will win because it's the final movie in the MCU. There was no creativity to how the avengers defeated Thanos. Iron Man builds a gauntlet that can snatch the stones from other gauntlets and harness it's powers. It was so lame)
9. Captain Marvel ( How can she breathe in space without her helmet that she wore in her solo movie? Was that just for show? Is she like Zombie Superman Princess Leia from The Last Jedi? I'm really glad that Tree Larson with her wooden plank face got less than 15 minutes of screen time)
10. Rescue (How and when did Pepper Potts learn to use the Rescue suit? )
11. Valkyrie (Where did Valkyrie got her Pegasus from? Weren't they all killed by Hela in Ragnarok? And why did Thor make her the queen of Asgardians? What makes her a worthy leader? They never showed us why she would be a better leader than Thor. When we first saw Valkyrie in Ragnarok, she was more depressed and broken down than Thor in Endgame. At least Thor didn't give up on his people like she did in her first movie)
12. Gamora (what was the point of showing little gamora and Thanos scene at the end of infinity war? Now gamora being her past self and not having any chemistry with the guardians ruins her character arc in previous two Guardians of the Galaxy movies)
13. Thanos (In infinity war Thanos was a menacing yet sympathetic villain, but in Endgame he's just another boring forgettable generic MCU villain like Malekith from The Dark World. It was a massive let down)
Spiderman (He's just a coward now. In infinity war he was brave enough to take on black order and not listening to Tony. He even defeated Ebony Maw using his brain and saved Doctor Strange's life. Now he just hides behind women's back, among them some have less experience in fighting than him)
14. Time travel suit (if time travel can't be done without quantum realm suits, how the hell did Thanos brought his whole army and himself into the future without such suits? They never showed us Ebony Maw using Pym particles for creating time machine.
15. Nebula (I wanted nebula to have more important role than she got. She's got a lot of screen time. But the interaction she has with other characters, except the ones with Tony in space, are kind of stupid and predictable)
16. The Ancient one (In doctor strange 2016 she was hesitant to teach strange because she thought he too would end up like keicillius. But in this movie which takes place in 2012 timeline, she is saying that strange is supposed to be the best among them. If that wasn't stupid enough, then just think how the hell did she know that strange would be the best sorcerer when she said that she can't see past her own death in 2016, and she died in that movie before strange defeated doormammu)
17. Mantis (what is her purpose in this movie? When all female MCU character came together to defeat Thanos, she just gave an awkward pose. That's it)
18. Hawkeye ( The whole thing in Japan didn't make sense to me. Like, what is he even doing there and why? How did Natasha find him? What happened to the spaceship that rocket gave him before time travel? Why didn't he use that in final battle against Thanos?)
19. Black widow ( she did not have a character arc like most other avengers. She's just there to sacrifice herself for the soul stone. It would have been more emotional if they had build up her relationship with Clint in a meaningful way instead of teasing about some Budapest incident audience know nothing about in Two movies and not showing us anything. In infinity war Gamora's death was tragic because they had shown us the father-daughter relationship between her and Thanos and how they care for one another. We didn't get that with Clint and Natasha. Her relationship with Cap, Tony and Banner got more screen time and had more depth than with Hawkeye. So, the whole scene in Vormir was not as emotional as Gamora's death in infinity war)
20. Rocket (how the hell did he got the reality stone from Jane? Since we know from Thor 2 that the aether can defend itself from any attacker. Even Odin and the Asgardians couldn't get it out of her body. How did rocket do it? With a taser? How did he turn aether into stone?)........
If I touch the subject of Time travel in this movie, the review would be 10x longer than this. All I can say here is that it's dumb. Seriously, who is giving this film 10 stars?"
593,"This movie in my opinion was considerably worse than Infinity War, too many inconsistencies and boring scenes which did not contribute much to the characters or the progression of the story. Much of the first 30-40 minutes of the film felt like filler put into the film in order to highlight the actors/actresses ability to act without many other implications to the story.Hulk and Thor do steal the show completely without a doubt however. Lastly, if the aggregious product placement was not completely off putting to you, then there is not much to say."
594,"Even whilst watching it, I felt disappointed: slow, wordy, sloppy storyline. Even the final battle was excessive to the point of tedious: too much fast cutting and too many unnecessary characters. Despite enjoying and appreciating most of the Marvel films, I felt this was a letdown."
595,"This film was too long.
The dialogues were boring and formalistic
Overall it represents the maximum of mediocrity.
It felt pretty much like when you eat too much candy."
596,"Two hours of boring talk, 45 minutes of action. Overblown and self indulgent."
597,"Way too long, drawn out and long winded. Very little action in it. Very little funny humor. Way too much cringe in it. Especially the ""SJW girl power"" scene towards the end. Massive cheese fest at the end. Couldn't wait for it to end while in the cinema. I enjoyed the last film but this was well below average. These 10/10 reviews are just Marvel fanboys I think."
598,"I am not a huge fan of the last Marvel movies. There are some very good movies, but the most is around average. Never so bad as most of the last DC movies. But Endgame is really game over for me.Please continue with X-men and guardians of the galaxy. It is enough for me. The rest I do not care anymore, it is ok like this. They professionally ruined it for me with Endgame.The story is very shallow, the solution is very shallow and also the action scenes are very shallow. Hours long they are busy with: yes we have something, but I have doubts, but it is great, but I don't know etc. And ofcourse all the heroes are very hurt and some are saying no at first, but already fast they overcome their hurt... And by the way: let's do some time traveling! Let's redo all the finding of the stones and snap the fingers a few times, it makes live so easy.So you have a 'big battle' where nothing happens and some action and after that it is saying goodbye to everybody. Oh wait! We forgot to think about a few death people, we just push commemorating them somewhere in the scenes. Iron man is the most important. Oh and captain Marvel is fixing everything ofcourse. I think she can save the whole universe on her own, who need the Avengers? And captain America has his ending: he is much older and guess what he did al that years? We do not need to guess because even that is explained, like we can not think for ourselves.Are there no good points? There was some humor and the graphics are looking good, but that is never the problem. And I see many people are happy with it, which I can not understand. But I do not need to. You can never make everybody happy, it is taste and interest. And for me this was a bad movie. Maybe the worst Marvel movie."
599,"End Game holds the same epic scale as Infinity War but with everything the first part lacked. This time around, the Russo's provide a more personal, character driven-tale filled with important character moments that I felt Infinity War severely lacked. As a result, despite the stakes being lower in this instalment, I was 10x more invested in the story and action and I truly worried for our heroes this time round.Our two main hero's, Cap and Tony, are definitely at their best here, despite their tensions from Civil war being brushed aside a little too quickly. The two actors are masters of these roles right now and all of their work pays off, with both characters seeing incredibly satisfying ends by the film's climax. Not to mention, other returning hero's also have satisfying, but admittedly controversial arcs, like Banner and Thor (who isn't as interesting as he was in Infinity war, but is still much better than the pre-Ragnarok rendition of the character).Because of the more personal story, the action feels less noisy and instead more tense and satisfying, with the final battle being by far the best that the series has offered.While Thanos takes a back seat in this film, he still remains menacing in his moments onscreen and an incredible motivator for our heroes that we've come to love over the years.Overall, End Game improves every weak aspect of Infinity War, and acts as a perfect conclusion to the Infinity saga."
600,"This is a good movie in terms of all its technical background but there is a lack of feel and energy throughout the film except for the scenes towards the end. You just needs to sit and wait patiently for the final battle.
If you are a Marvel fan then you will enjoy it like any other Marvel films otherwise it can get sort of boring surely an overrated film."
601,"The hardest thing to do is end something. The ending of a story, novel, or movie is probably the hardest thing to write. This is not the climax and falling action, but the resolution, where all the dangling threads are tied up and resolved. Very few writers can create one with supreme satisfaction - mostly because in this day and age writers want sequels and franchises. Avengers Endgame is the pinnacle of Marvel movies. It is a masterpiece of the super-hero genre. It gives closure, and resolution.
The movie picks up almost immediately after Thanos snapped half the world out of existence. The remaining Avengers, Iron Man (Tony Stark), War Machine (Don Cheedle), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are trying to gather their wits after they had their asses handed to them.
Tony is on his way back to Earth from Titan. His only companion is Nebula (Karen Gillian). Fortunately, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) comes to the rescue. Bringing them back to Earth, they are reunited ... for a moment. Tony wants nothing to do with them after Cap's betrayal. He goes back to Pepper.
The remaining heroes track down Thanos (Josh Brolin) and find the Infinity Stones have destroyed themselves, as well as him. Now, what do we do?
Five years later, a van in San Francisco has its computer activated by a mouse. It activates the shrinking device that left Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) stranded in the shrunken universe. He comes back - but the five year isolation was only five hours to the Ant Man. He traverses the nation to find the Avengers. When he learns of what happened, he has an idea. The microscopic universe has entry and exit points in time.
Yes, they can travel back in time and find the Infinity Stones, bring them back, and snap everyone back into existence. Hey, you have to realize that time travel was going to come into this sooner or later. The Avengers need Tony to figure out a way to take out the random effects, but he is tied too much to Pepper (Gwenyth Paltrow), and their daughter, Morgan.
Tony, though, cannot back out of a possibility of setting things right. He is onboard with the idea, so three teams travel back to different points. Tony, Bruce, Steve, and Scott (hey, my name's Steve Scott!) head to New York after the Avengers battle. Roadie, Nebula, Nadia, and Clint (Jeremy Renner) return to the stellar world where two other stones exist. Rocket and Thor return to Asgaarrd before its destruction to fetch a couple of others.
As they find the stones, they find themselves - as well as a slew of MCU characters that helped and hindered them on the way. Loki, Brumlow, Sitwell, Pierce (Robert Redford) all have their cameos as former HYDRA secret operatives. Of course, it would be a sin not to have Tom Hiddleston return as Loki. Tony and Steve go to another spot where Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy Carter (Haylee Atwell), and Tony gets to have some words with his father, Howard Stark (John Slattery).
Thor gets to see Jane again (Natalie Portman), as well as his mother, Frigga (Rene Russo). Rocket has to work hard and convince him to take the stones back. Of course, Thor cannot leave without one particular thing.
Meanwhile, Clint and Nadia have to retrieve the Soul Stone. They need a soul to get it. At the same time, Thanos, who is alive at this point, realizes the Nebula of the past is having glitches. He and Gamora (Zoe Saldana) are able to figure out what they are doing there. Realizing their plan, he has to stop them and make sure his plan comes through.
You can tell this all-star cast was handled well, providing story, action, laughs, and even tears. A few of these heroes sacrifice themselves for others. They get to reconcile themselves over past mistakes, regrets, and get to redeem themselves. They are reunited with loves ones lost five years ago when Thanos snapped his fingers. And they fight together against a foe for the first time since Avengers Age of Ultron. They were one team.
Someone could easily nit-pick this one, especially on the time travel. However, the ending brings so much satisfaction. Between the sacrifices, the second chances, the characters all have their resolutions tied up, with no post-credit scenes. Some of the character arcs are messy, but the movie provides an emotional satisfaction unheralded in motion picture history. Avengers Endgame gets a perfect score."
602,"A wonderful and amazing movie for all the fans.
So much emotions, so many nostalgic moments, and action, humor, drama! We get to see all the superheroes and some more loveable characters.
I feel sorry for those who try to find scientific logic in a movie about superheros. You really need to focus on what's important.
Just enjoy!"
603,Watching this movie has me seriously thinking of inventing my own time machine. I would either go back and prevent the Russo brothers from making this movie or at the very least go back in time and not buy tickets to this movie. All my hopes that had been built up for a year were shattered. Dropped. Smashed. Shattered.
604,"Plot holes everywhere, cheesy lines,basically the average superhero movie and no one sees how bad it is because they're blinded by hype, endgame was a mediocre poorly thought out rushed movie that feels more like a cashgrab"
605,"After two hours of absolutely nothing happening, I walked away. A complete and utter waste of time and money. How long do you expect me to wait for SOMETHING to happen?"
606,Are those people who rated this higher than a four suffering from cognitive dissonance? It seems you all allowed the hype to inect your thinking and judgement. This is in my opinion the worse film in the Marvel universe series followed by civil war. To many characters a (story) so so lazy that wasonly written to try and tie the strands of the universe together. The film is at least 1 whole hour to long and is frankly boring. Disney are in danger of destroying this franchise like they have ruined the star wars saga. Why have they ruined the hulk who is now a cuddly bubbling idiot with everything that made him one of the most loved characters stripped from him. Even the set pieces are so so nothing different nothing original. People on here need to start telling the truth because a rating averaging 8.6 is simply a lie. Go watch it and review it without society's cognitive dissonance about this film running through your brains. 4/10 the worse in the series.
607,"It is a soppy story. There was no grit. No realism. No wow moments. Just utter disappointment.They can only go once. Then go a few times.They cannot change the past. Then they change the past.If you change the past, it will change the future... uhm, well let's forget about that and concentrate on special hero stuff and then keep the present as is despite killing the antagonist from the past meaning the future (or present) wouldn't actually be.Then they have these pouted pauses one would expect in soap operas from the 80's. The pouted pauses are with dearest family and friends in a warm sunny glow.The only funny thing, for a moment, was Thor.They could cut the movie by 2h35 and it would be immensely better."
608,"Marvel, since under Disney management, fails in innovating and goes for the safe route of recycling its blockbusters. The movie feels like a weird mix of burger, pizza, skittles and Ben&Jerries. Very disappointing of Marvel."
609,"The first 1.5 hr was suuuuper boooring. I ate all of my chips, food, chocolates, drink I was so bored....This guys couldn't decide for 5 yrs what to do, then in 2min this Iron Man found out everything.
I missed Wonder Woman A LOT and of course Aquaman...
Also I did not like the end! It was depressing, frustrating ..to see this good looking Captain guy old.. I waited after the last movie something delightful at the end..got the same bad feeling :/
This movie was disappointing for those who sometimes take a look behind the curtain:/"
610,"Most electrifying scenes of all time, most emotional scenes of all time, greatest action, hardest goodbyes, comedy, tear rolling big six credits... and so much more. I just wish the writers gave Iron man and Thor their own great moments to shine during the fight with thanos."
611,"Loved it so much, just can't see a story with so much depth getting better."
612,"Thank you for 10 years of great entertainment! Loved all the 22 movies and can't wait to see the next 22.
A great ending to a 2 part movie. All was 5 stars, ALL! Masterpieces! Will rewatch all, forever... AVENGERS!"
613,"Where to begin? All the callbacks and tie-ins to past MCU films are truly a celebration of the MCU. As always, the action is exciting(Although sparse) and humour cracks you up. This movie reaches a new level going into the third act, with epic moments that put a grin on your face and an ending that might just put a tear in your eye. A must watch!"
614,"I am writing this review months after I last saw it, but yet doubt you'll ever see a better film than this one in a long time! A fantastic way to mark the end of some of our favourite characters and the final battle will send chills down your spine. If you haven't already then go watch Avengers: Endgame"
615,"Let's start with this, the plot has little flaws or plot holes here and there. And if you didn't watch a whole lot of other previous MCU films. Maybe this is not for you.For me, who watched every MCU movies ever produced. This one has it all.
A new take on hero movie, part of it like mission impossible. Very well thought out story. A hidden layer of means. Take its time to resolve many things, not rushing it.If Ironman I is a 10, this one is a 11."
616,"When i saw this movie in the theater the second weekend after it came out, I really enjoyed what it lived up to...the culmination of 10+ years of Marvel movies that were interconnected to each other through phases in a huge cinematic universe that has become the biggest one of them all...Marvel. Lasting for 3 hours and thankfully not having an after credit scene, Endgame, like the previous one, kills off a lot of major characters, with the first MCU hero to grace the big screen sacrificing himself with the gauntlet that he acquires from Thanos after defeating him and letting Dr. Strange use portals to bring back many of the good avengers from the dead and bring the universe to a conclusion. It ends with Captain america reuniting with his girlfriend back in the 1940s, after we see him in modern times aged so much. This was the last movie to feature Black Panther, as of this update the actor died overnight, leaving Marvel to consider a replacement for the late Chadwick Boseman for the upcoming sequel."
617,"It's funny it's a great movie with great reviews and is highly successful, overall. But, the trolls are coming out to play on imdb today, boy. It tied up previous loose ends from past films, it had a good story that was inventive, fun and clever. It had many easter eggs tied to past films and movies and is a great superhero film and a good film, period.9.4/10"
618,"But sheep are watching this in droves....Avengers END-YAWN....... WTF?!?!?!Boring as crap.If they made 2 x 3 hour movies, it would still be boring as crap.But, at least they humanised Thors depression....... although F-wit audiences think it's a joke.morons watching moron movies.
Thank Christ to no more Robert Downey Trumpstick."
619,I'll just keep this brief. This movie is thoroughly overrated. The first act was a drag. The final fight left a lot to be desired. And don't get me started on fat Thor 😑. I've been a fan of marvel forever and this was such a let down for what was promised
620,"Ah, humanity.. if the collective decides that something is good, cool and great, it sees it through tragically twisted perspective.
This time, everyone just seems to fall under the brainwashing hype train of this whole Marvel cinematic universe cultural farce.
Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.Not me!
I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest."
621,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is actually solid in terms of acting and special effects, being it way too long. The big issue here is that 'Infinity War' raised the bar so high, this is just an unworthy sequel. In three hours of movie, you actually get some credible story for no more than 10 minutes. The time-travel solution always looked likely but how it developed was way too predictable. There are way too many plot holes and easy way outs for the story to actually go where it is supposed to go. Some of the heroes are conveniently placed in certain situations out of nowhere and the impending happy ending is always pretty clear to whoever puts some thought rather than just trying to be entertained! I would not watch this again, probably never, unlike 'Infinity War'."
622,The drama was not in the form required and the comedy is not funny and some of the footage is meaningless
623,"Not worth it..... three hours from my life .....
Boring, long, it should be better."
624,"Is the movie entertaning? sure. is the movie good? nope. It's actually one of the weakest mcu movies. maybe even worse than black panther and spiderman. and those 2 were really bad.so basically, a rat saved the day. Not Hulk, not tony stark but a rat. oh, and time travel. it's like they wrote the scenario in 1 day, in rehab.It's a pitty that after Infinity War, which was awesome, we got this dissapointing finale.9 stars? lol."
625,Truly epic and incredible experience worth every penny
626,This movie is fun. Nerding out about the massive 23 film undertaking is fun. The storyline is fun. The character evolutions are fun.End Game is an amazing addition to an already epic collection of movies. Duck the haterz 🦆
627,Long movie that struggle to have flow during the 1st half. Ending made up for the 1st part. Great emotional ending scene with all of the characters coming back in a heroic scene. Had my daughter in tears-of joy. That in itself is an epic moment. Acting was solid by all characters.
628,"9/10 - an impressive cast list, an enthralling storyline, and an epic end to an era enables this superhero flick to stand out among the increasing monotony of the genre"
629,The best ending to finalize the mcu sequels. Love everything about it.
630,"Review is pasted below from my original review of my blog back in April. Link for that is below as well, it's the same review with added links and visuals/photos. Thanks :)kunalatthemovies.movie.blog/2019/04/24/avengers-endgame-spoiler-free-review/Avengers: Endgame is directed by Marvel Studio veterans, Anthony and Joe Russo. They previously directed Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War. (In my opinion they have directed some of the best MCU films) They are currently the only directors who have directed 4 films in the MCU.I honestly do not know where to begin, because I genuinely do not want to spoil anything about this film. On Wednesday April 24th I went for an early morning 3am advanced screening in Dolby Cinema of the film so that I can go in blind and avoid any kind of spoilers, and it worked brilliantly. I will be watching the film again on Saturday April 27th in IMAX, since it is the only film to be shot entirely (3 hours and 2 minutes) with IMAX cameras. I wish for all the fans to watch the film in the same way, go in totally blind and you will not be disappointed. This film works with surprise, shock and awe. One of the only other films that left the same impression on me was The Empire Strikes Back, which I believe is a film that the Russo Brothers highly admire, I mean who doesn't.Anyway, back to the MCU. I will not disclose any plot points of the film, I won't even provide any captured frames of the film/trailer. I will however talk about the aesthetics and qualities of the film.
The pacing of the film fluctuates slightly, I mean it is just over three hours long, but a welcomed three hours. Some people might find it a little too long, especially the first act. The first act is definitely a slow burn, but it has to be because of what happened at the end of Infinity War. It needed to be sober and built up to the recuperation of what the heroes just went through, the heroes we have grown to love over the past decade. However the pacing picks up significantly with a surprising and perfectly enjoyable fun second act; and a climactic third act that is emotionally hard hitting.
The musical score isn't groundbreaking but it does satiate the appetite of the visuals in the film. We have all heard and been pumped up by the Avengers theme, which this film uses a few times at key narrative points.What I love about the filmmaking of the Russo's is their viceral style that also manages to feel grounded where the viewer feels like a part of what is happening. In all their MCU films I never felt like a man in the sky watching over what is happening on the ground with the characters. They manage to frame the action where it feels intense and emotional yet without having confused close ups or a ""shaky cam"" effect, which unfortunately many action films do nowadays.
The production design and sets of Endgame are amazing, with a mix of practical effects and CG set pieces striking a perfect balance like never before in the MCU. Without giving away anything, I will say I was extremely surprised with a lot of the set pieces and ""things"" and ""stuff"" that happened.
Sorry I really can't go into any more detail than that. If you are a fan and have been following the MCU films, Endgame is something you will definitely enjoy and feel satisfied about. It manages to create ""fan service"" without compromising on quality or impact, be it emotionally or narratively.If you haven't watched most, if not all, of the previous 21 Marvel Studios films, then I have to say that this film will not impact you in the way that it is meant to. You cannot view Endgame as a solo self contained film. It is a culmination 3 phases and 21 films spanning 11 years. Yes each phase had an ""end,"" Phase One ended with The Avengers (2012), Phase Two ended with Avengers: Age of Ultron/Ant-Man (2015). But I would say those would be end of chapters, whereas Endgame isn't just the end of Phase Three or a chapter, it is the end of a book, the end of the Infinity Saga, honestly the end of an era.The entire MCU so far has been an overall success with a few films falling short in quality, Endgame brings it all to a satisfying close. The film takes risks and does a lot of unexpected things that I feel strengthen the film as a whole. It manages to somewhat breakaway from the formulaic superhero genre and manages to try and be something different. As Endgame climaxed, so did I and I honestly cannot wait to watch Endgame again on Saturday, this time in IMAX. It's going to be a whole different experience to a film I think is near perfect.Rating:
I am giving Avengers: Endgame a 9 out of 10.
Highly recommended to any and all Marvel fans and even the casual Marvel film goer. A gripping conclusion of a 21 film saga, I cannot wait to see what is the next step in the MCU. I am happy and thankful to Marvel Studios for making all these films and building this saga to a crescendo with Endgame. I laughed, I cried, I gasped, I was on the edge of my seat during this film. This whole three phase journey has been a wild ride, let's hope their next phases can hit the mark again and perhaps take it further. Until Spider-Man: Far From Home (which Kevin Feige has said is the actual last film of Phase Three) is released in July, Marvel Studios has said they will not officially announce anything about their future plans for the MCU. So we will have to just wait until post July 2019. However Disney finalized acquiring the rights of 21st Century Fox this year, so we can expect the X-Men and Fantastic Four to join the MCU in the near future. Also Disney+ streaming service is launching towards the end of this year so we can expect to see a lot more original content being shot and produced, from smaller budget feature films to original series based in the MCU. What can I say except 2019 is a great year for Marvel and Disney overall."
631,"Iron man is the best Avenger! I'm so sorry he's dead...
We love you 3000!"
632,"Failure with no purpose , and the rating is all about fans"
633,"Thor's take on ""the dude"" was the best part of the movie.Too long and sentimentalMost of the focus is on the original avengers which is good but many of the storylines were just not very excitingI would wait to see this on video"
634,"Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not.
Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation? Last one - certainly not."
635,"After embarrassing the Hulk in Infinity, one was assuredly expecting an upgrade. No.With a intricate plot and a surely checkmate event in Infinity, the solution had to be mind-blowing. No.What we got was fat jokes and the two most unquestionably powerful characters benched for the WHOLE movie, in a seriously shameful manner, melded with a brain-dead undoing that doesn't make sense or do justice to Infinity."
636,"The action sequences are always the same, the plots are always the same, every Marvel movie in this cinematic universe was exactly the same. All 22 of them were the same movie.There is no creativity, just massive budgets, a star studded cast, as much cgi as possible, boring dialogue, poor character development, no deeper meaning whatsoever, poor cinematography, eye popping special effects, and watered down violence that is on par with the old power rangers.These movies can't even hold a flame to the Dark Night trilogy which deal with the human condition, psychology, are immensely quotable, have real violence, and are more than guys in tights dancing around triumphantly saying the corniest lines ever spoken in the history of cinema.George Lucas made Star Wars to sell toys, and these Marvel movies are no different. Why do you think Disney bought the rights to both?"
637,"I seriously don't get all the high ratings on this film!! The first hour was a total boring snooze fest (it was like being at a wake). Then there are the logic problems in the movie:
1) Time travel- the movie tells us that they can't go back in time and kill Thanos because that would 'violate the time laws' okay but they can go back and steel the stones, fight with their past selves, and interact with their dead parents???
2) the society can build a well manicured monument complete with granite engraved names of the missing but CAN'T pick up the garbage all over the streets???
3) Okay half the people are gone but why are the scenes full of EMPTY streets?? You'll still have people in the cites just half as many. So NYC would go from 1 million plus to 500,000 plus. ect.Anyways for me it was not well written, the acting was flat, and the action was missing. I think Infinity War was 10x better."
638,"I am a big fan of the MCU, I have watched every Marvel movie ever released, even the not so good ones prior to the MCU. I thought Infinity War was incredible and this simply did not follow up the hype for me. The first two hours were pretty boring for me, I didn't like the fact that they made Thor into a punchline for the entire movie, it would have been fine if they did that before the time jump, or made him somehow get back into shape, but it was just dumb. The Hulk was not a physical presence for the second straight movie now. Black Widow's death was the one that I felt the most, Stark's end was touching while Spidey was there, but when Pepper stepped in, her lack of emotion made me feel nothing also. The fight scene at the end was great, but other than that, it was a so-so movie for me."
639,"Everyone is going to hate me for this review. Partial spoiler.This movie was totally predictable, full of flaws with a repeat of if the Infinity War battle , where IMHO they could have just used the same footage.Does Hollywood have no remaining creative ability?2 hours of slow moving, boring video to get to a totally expected ending.While not a total waste of time I am thankful I got a discount and only paid $4.00 for this film.My wife on the other hand fell asleep"
640,"It was painful to watch this movie as it reached its conclusion. Great movies don't need a happy ending. Infinity War was a perfect example. Endgame, however, left me 10 times sadder. Sad, bored, annoyed and disappointed. No need to state the reasons, as many reviewers before me properly did that.What amazes me though is how the Russos did a fantastic job with movies like The Winter Soldier or Infinity War and came up with this grotesque finale. I cannot conceive any reasonable explanation, other than Disney having a hidden malefic plan to slaughter great franchises (for Star Wars they decided to go with a slow painful process). Whatever it takes, right?"
641,"To all the haters, sit and think about the sheer amount of story, fan service, fun, epicness and sadness that tge managed to pack into 3 hours. The Russo bros had to tie up 22 movies and that is impossible, yet they pretty much pulled it off, anyone who says the price of admission wasn't worth it just for the Captain America scenes alone may as well stop watching movies. This is a tough act to follow, and a far more worthy record holder than the blue alien pocahontas rip off ever was. Keep it up Marvel, we are eagerly waiting for the next 10 years of amazing stories."
642,"Just wow. I have watched every Marvel movie from the very beginning, and after I literally bawled through the end of Infinity War, I couldn't wait to see how this amazing saga would end in Endgame. And it certainly didn't disappoint. I absolutely LOVED the movie. It had many hilarious moments, great CGI, and some really heartbreaking and heartwarming moments which literally brought me to tears. A true credit to the creators of this film and the actors too. If you haven't yet seen it, ENJOY."
643,"Avengers endgame is the end of the infinity saga and it is the perfect ending. I may not be good with words but this movie was amazing! I am seeing it again tomorow for the 7th time! It is a little slow in the first hour, but it makes up for it because I am invested in these characters. I am happy with what they did with Thor and hulk because it makes sense in the context of their character ark. Thanos in this movie is not as good as he is in infinity war but that was the same with the heroes. Captain America for example was not very good in infinity war but now he is amazing in endgame. People like infinity war for the villain, and I think people should like endgame for the heroes. After all, these are superHERO movies!"
644,First off let me point out something notice how most of the reviews here are basically blocked out so that it only shows 1 star and below. I feel like these r the reviews that r fake.This movie was an excellent ending to a beautiful era of the avengers universe. Every single individual superhero movie was worth watching in prep for this movie. The time travel scenes helped in case newcomers never seen the previous movies. The cgi was excellent and the casting as usual was great. I absolutely loved the surprise ending whe. All chracters gather together to fight thanos himself. This movie is worth seeing for any marvel fan.
645,"Unbelievable idea to use time travel to correct what Thanos did.
It's one of best movies of Marvel Production"
646,"Im happy to see finale like that , goodbye Avengers ;("
647,"What a let down after Infinity War! it felt like the writers was really tired and just wanted to get this over with... Ok I have always had a hard time understanding time traveling, but this one shouldn't have been hard. Of course everyone get it that Marvel wouldn't kill of the majority of their superheroes, that they would come back some how, but I expected more. The feeling of surprise and wonder wasn't there...
Lame ending after the amazing build up in IW. Three hours of my life I never get back."
648,"The Russo Bro's should be commended by what they brought to the BIG SCREEN! this movie is GOLD! everything about it is non-stop fun, emotional thrill ride especially if you have followed the franchise for years. The tears will fall but the smiles will grow bigger than ever before. Some say 3 hours is too long but it's not long enough, I could spend forever growing with these Hero's and the wonderful actors portraying them, feel like a kid again and wishing I was a superhero! Heartwarming in all the right places. 10/10 my favorite movie of all time!"
649,"Couldn't believe how long this film was when I heard! 3 hours is just overwhelmingly bad if you ask me but still considering that I seen the previous 3 films I had to give this one a chance at least once.Went into this knowing the torture of watching a 3 hour film with an over stretched story line, plot holes galore, dragged scenes & political correctness shoved down your throat & that wasn't even the icing on the cake!But then after watching I found the film was below 3 hours. Actually, it was 2 hours & 49 minutes in total, but that's no far off the 3 hour mark. The film itself was ok & I mean below mediocre at best & at worst overrated!The story-line was easy enough to follow, but still had some confusing points which weren't well executed. Like the part where they traveled back in time & they were fighting their past selves. Other plot points too which didn't illustrate well what was happening or what was what.The run time which is obviously the biggest let down also contributed to the dragging nature which stretched out a story-line so simple it could've snapped! The ending especially was like watching paint dry in slow motion & my arse felt pretty numb when I left the cinema.There was some good action parts but there isn't much goes to say about this film or others like it which are clearly forgettable & loaded with confusing story-lines, details & sci-fi overkill.I also didn't appreciate the political correctness & female feminazi empowerment in this film which I seen twice at the finale part. A black woman at the end being ""king"" or ""leader"" of the land instead of Thor really? I don't know... I'd say that political correctness itself is just part of the issue I have with these films overall. It needs to stop!Overall not good & seriously over hyped for what it is! I can safely say these films have gone down hill since the beginning of the 2010's. They've delved into too much sci-fi, complicated story-lines with too much details, are too up in the air & not grounded enough & are riddled with political correctness! It's just sad as the classics before it were so much better & watchable, if not RE-watchable!The 10/10 reviews are clearly fake & once again proves just how biased the rating system has become with paid reviewers giving this junk anything over what I've rated it as. More honesty & less BS.2/10"
650,"I watched this and it gave me what I wanted without overblowing the movie with too many subplots. Other than the time travel aspect of the movie, even though any movie with time travel can be scrutinized it is a great film."
651,"Ten years the MCU has been with us, and through all these years I've been watching their films and grading them like a teacher grades homework. Sometimes too harshly maybe. Today I'll be at my most benevolent, so the rating might be somewhat biased.Let's be honest. All the previous MCU movies, except the Captain America ones, were inherently flawed (as Thanos would've said, those flaws were ""inevitable""). Not because of the writing or the visuals, but because of the heroes' nature. Only Steve Rogers was both mature and complete from within, so his story was always solid and compelling on all levels. All the other ""heroes"" were more or less kids in powersuits, fighting their own childhood traumas or searching for their purpose. And, as much as I love the coming-of-age movies, a certain annoying goofiness is always their prominent part.But not today. Thanos' Snap didn't just remove a half of the universe's population - it forced everyone to re-evaluate their whole modi operandi. When so many people just... vanish all of a sudden, you just can't stay the same, especially if you feel like it's in a way your fault.And this turn has given us the first hour of this film, maybe the deepest and the most sincere hour in the history of the superhero genre. The post-apocalyptic fright isn't anything new, but this time it's not about the actual survival, but rather trying to accept the new reality, in which, by some lucky coincidence, you were... allowed to live, while some people hadn't been.This, and the whole grandeur of the culmination, are the things that mark out Endgame as a masterpiece of its kind, which deserves to be remembered. The rest is a pretty typical Marvel'esque stuff, lots of pathos and bright CGI effects. Towards the end the movie becomes almost too sentimental, but I guess I would be too, if that universe became my second family for ten years.One more thing. I've been a part of the Team Cap since his first film, and I rooted for his side in Civil War. But this time Steve Rogers and Tony Stark managed to play it together and create a duo that truly shines. I guess when a story that big comes to an end, everyone has a chance to be a hero without overshadowing anyone else."
652,"I really really enjoyed this movie.
At first I asked myself do I want to sit through a 3 hour movie...? The answer was yes and boy am I happy with the results.
The moment the movie started I was hooked. The pace of the movie started off slow and picked up as the film went on. Even during the slow moments I didn't want to move and miss anything. You can really tell when actors, Directors and everyone else who works on the production of a film put in their maximum efforts. This was one of those movies.
This was very well made and I cannot wait to see what is next for marvel."
653,"I think Thor said it best in the previous film=""This is farewell and good luck, morons."""
654,"I am sort of sorry that the rares time I write a review, it is not a kind one.
But I am sorrier still that the rares times I watch theater movies, it is because of high ratings of previous reviewers.Yep, that is how i chose this one.""Astonishing"", ""perfect"", ""masterpiece"", ""9 out of 10"" were some of the comments and ratings around, so I thought, this must be it, if I have to see one movie this year, it's this one.But honestly :Special effects, are good.Plot is so plain you understand what is going to happen and how it is going to end in the first ten minutes. And there are no twists whatsoever.
Everything is pretty much recycled from other movies - not talking about ""avengers"" or marvel series; rather, just any SF movies out there were used as ideas sources to fill this one. Nothing new, nothing different.Yeah, there are a few nice jokes, and some fat, both so badly plugged you can see the stitching (you'll understand when you see it). In the past, when heroes were making jokes during a battle, it was to show they mastered the situation, and it was fitting the atmosphere and pace; in this one, you can see at some point the director absolutely wanted to put a joke in the middle of the main battle - broke the rythm and half spoiled the mood just because of that.Movie is three hours long.I just watched two episodes of an old anime series from the 80's, and in those 46 minutes, there was pretty much as much action and stuff going on than in these almost-three-hours of medium paced show. So although people say it was needed to fit all the references to previous marvel movies, i'd rather have less references and more things happening in this one.As it often happens in these follow-ups, previous movies created such an intricate situation that this one solved in such a straight-forward way, it felt as if somebody wanted it rushed to the finish.And in order to do that, it took the party of a lousy quantum physics theory (which is actually wrong, btw), and left some important side question unansweredAnd not to talk about the mania from the producers to destroy stuff that went on for décades, or millennia, all in the timespan of a few years! We had ragnarok, the death of Odin.. And now.. this?
Well without spoiling the movie for those that want to see it, I'd say it looked like they wanted to make sure that this put an end to the story. Even if that meant to break the logic of these movies : ""Thus far and no further we shall make avengers movies""
God complex, perhaps?All in all, it wasn't any better than an old Flash Gordon movie, except for the SFX that are of course more modern. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10, as 1 and 2 are reserved for movies that don't deserve watching till the end.
But I believe that once the paid comments and the avengers mania will be past, many other will downrate this, that definitely did not deserve all that advertising and praise it received so far.Definitely a cash movie, nothing more."
655,Kids wrote plot for the movie. Ppl are getting made for nothing
656,"Has a lot of plotholes, but I still enjoyed it. However, the rating should be lowered to atleast 7 so im giving it 1 to balance it out, as all things should be."
657,"I can't believe that this was how they decided to bring to a close 11yrs of great stories, and memorable characters, esp after Infinity War left us with such a pit in our stomachs, and anxiety about what would come next for End Game.What we got was completely and utter failure, on biblical proportions, and a storyline that was made for moviegoers who want silly jokes and vivisecting plot holes that make no sense, and go nowhere.With it all tied up in an end battle scene that lasted all of 8 minutes time.I've heard people calling it ""an ode to nostalgia"", and ""a trip down memory lane at its best"".I could not disagree more, and think that the Russo Brothers really dropped the ball, BIG TIME, on a franchise, and group of characters, that have come to define a new generation of movie making, and meant so much to people world wide, over the last decade.For the last 10yrs time, marvel has given me something to be excited about when going to the movies, and something to look forward to every year, with multiple movies released per year, and new faces being added to the line up that projected its credibility & depth to higher & higher levels.21 movies, all come crashing down, in a thunderous, murderous, calamity filled mess of a 3hr movie.To say I am disappointed is an incredible understatement.Bad form, MarvelBad Form, Russo BrothersCompletely Dispicable, Disney."
658,"A disjointed CGI mess. Too much going on to feel like a real narrative was going on. Very few laughs, didn't feel like it had much of a soul. Thought infinity war was a much more complete marvel movie."
659,"This movie is so Fantactic, Funny, Inspiring, And so much more. I loved Cap lifting mjolnir so much i loved the ending more then any thing iloved professer hulk i loved fat thor and i just cant belive some people are saying its bad."
660,"As for superhero films go, this was certainly not that good. Firstly, the whole thing was over hyped which is always a red flag for myself. Not to mention the huge plot holes in the film in regards to the time travelling aspect of it all, an example being Steve Rogers deciding to stay in the past with his love interest. If you also remove all the super powers from this film all you're left with is a terribly written story where the viewer travels back to the last decade of films pumped out by Marvel Studios. All in all a huge disappointment. However, the only redeeming factor for this film was Captain Marvel taking that good ole' sucker punch."
661,"I did not like Endgame. Infinity War was so good.. I don't know why, but.. i did not leave the cinema with a good feeling after watching this film.. thanos brought so much pain and then he is just working in his garden? Weak and aimless?
In my opinion, it wasn't funny what happens with Thor's belly.. and the rest of him..
He has always been this strong man and suddenly he is afraid of everything.. idk
And of course, it made me really sad that Black Widow died instead of hawkey. In the end of the day, I am also sad bc of Iron Man, too.Gamora hasn't often shown her real feelings to quill and now she has even forgotten him.. bc it is past gamora from the other timeline.. it feels wrong..I didn't like the story as much as I expected. I had high hopes."
662,And youll have a decent action flick for teenagers. the rest is pathetic and boring. juts forgettable: very foreseeable plot and a finale that borows from an american football superbowl.
663,"I liked the first half a lot,there were many funny moments that worked (mainly overweight Thor and Rocket) mixed with good action. The second half turned more to the emotional side and some moments didn't make sense at all (main characters left alone by the aliens to have a heartfelt dialogue in the middle of a battle),it kept dragging on and on much like the last 20 min of LOTR return of the king making sure all main characters get a proper emotional ending.
Bottom Line : could have been the best MCU movie ever with a shorter second half and less emotional scenes. I still consider the first iron man and guardians of the galaxy the best MCU movies to date."
664,"I'd tell the story I saw but it was all so confusing. I can't believe how high the garbage has been rated!!! I have seen every marvel movie that has been release and watched and liked Infinity war though I thought it dragged on. No super hero movie should ever go for more than 2 hours...EVER. Now it has dawned on me that disney and the writers of this flick had nothing but cash in mind when planning these. The first Avengers was amazing, i believed that age of ultron was the forerunner for something epic with Thanos then these 2 movies were just a massive let down but it's all about cash and I took the bait. Hook, line and sinker. A final movie is supposed to give all the answers but this just gave me so many questions and left me confused and wondering whether I loved or hated it. Now it has sunk in and I gave it thought i just hate it. Too many contradictions. Don't get me wrong. The action is good in this movie and there are parts I loved about it but the parts i hate out weighed them. Damn you Disney!!!!"
665,"The bad stuff:
Gives closure to an ambitious project. But not really its own movie.
Suffers from time travel problems for a movie this big. It really hurts it.
Not making good use of this huge cast of characters by making cool unique interactions. Rather they opted to change iconic characters to see them like never before. So, kind of reliving the first Avengers movie, they even prioritized the same core characters.The good stuff:
Nice 40 minutes of CGI superhero vs villain fights.
Tons of references to the comics."
666,"Loved most of the first 22(?) films in the series. Endgame truly sucked. Decent acting, absolutely crap plot. I wish I'd never seen any of the film's in the series now."
667,"People have no idea how to review things anymore,they all just put 10/10 because of hype and this is the last of the series..No this movie is the best thing of all time,its NOT a perfect work of art nor masterpiece,in fact its very poorly done and had a pathetic ending. I real waste of my money and time. Things all started going downhill after Infinity War..Thor is a one big giant joke,hes not godly,epic,interesting or manly anymore hes just a big man child. Hulk was always a bit more comical which is fine but now its on this whole new level of stupidity. Ironman is the only one with any character left and yet even Robert Downey Jr has to suffer when pitted against such terrible writing. Things just happen that dont make sense, characters suddenly become moronic and the entire build up of epic moments is taken down into this ultra cringe scene that ruins the whole plot.The constant misplaced child humor and the attempts to make ever little scene into a Disney baby movie is sickening. Things can't be taken seriously anymore or its too offensive,everything needs to be dumbed down into this childish mush so the general public can clap their hands and drool. I'm really glad this series is over with before they burn it into the ground more..Yet i cant help but think about all the other comics that will be ruined with this writing style..Are IQs really so low now that this is what counts as a ""good"" movie?!"
668,"I was so excited before and so let down afterwards.While Infinity War was better paced and presented Thanos's goal and how he worked to achive it having some philosophy behind, here we are greeted with alot of self pity and ""he hit us, we must kill him"" plot. That's all there is, no deeper meaning. We could also call them Revengers from now on.Unfortunately very quickly in Endgame the revenge mechanism appeared. The oh-so-convenient time travel. Quantum everything and there you go, Endgame solved. Add to that the overall ""our chosen good guys must win"" obvious direction and the suspense or thrill for the movie vanished instantly.Cutting a long story short:
Fat Thor was funnyBannerulk looked like an aged man trying to blend his passions with the responsabilitiesNebula should have changed her cloud password :)Disliked Captain Marvel's haircutAlternate timelines selflishly affected in order to achive their revenge. How did they patch the Soul stone or the Tessaract that fell in Loki's hands?!Let's say Captain America got from barely moving Mlornir to easily swinging it because he became more worthy but the lightning thing?! Wasn't Thor the god of lightning not the god of hammers As Odin told him?!. Therefore the lightning was channeled from Thor through Mlornir not from the hammer itself.Fighting power greatly inconsistentFat Thor got so weak with Stormbreaker AND Mlornir to barely fight NG (No Gauntlet) Thanos?!How did NG Thanos expect to attack all heroes at once and let only Nebula look for the stones?!How could Gauntlet Thanos be so weak with the glove on?! I mean he could exit through a portal, get at full strenght and then return to smash them all over again - that's an easy plot hole.Too much plot armor overall for all superheroesThe continuous juggle with the gauntlet that went on and off so easyThanos reduced from a clever driven villan to a generic average bad guyAnyways, that's my impression of the movie.
Not sure I will rewatch it like I did so many times with Infinity War.
Maybe the other 14M alternate futures got a better story.Over and out.Edit: Lowered the score, changed title and added 2 lines to be more accurate. Reality is often disappointing."
669,"Amazing how Marvel has created this cinematic universe. So many good stories, all connected. This movie was long but great to watch."
670,Listen I'll take X-Men over the avengers any day. boring characters
671,I was bored in the first 2 hours. Let down from my own expectation.
672,"This movie is the best marvel movie till now.Captain america shouldn't get old
Iron man shouldn't died"
673,We know this most best selling movie of all time... im already watching this movie more than 2 time... and never get bored
674,Thanx Marvel for doing such art and make it exists.
675,This movie was the best avengers movie and I think it wrapped up the Captain America and iron man storyline very well. This movie was very emotional. The movie did not feel like 3 hours long it felt like a one hour movie . Overall great movie and great Characters really enjoyed it.
676,"Can't be over, I want more! I'll miss all of them together, fighting as one"
677,"⭐⭐ Screenplay: 92/100⭐ Acting Performance: 87/100⭐ Film Editing: 88/100⭐⭐ Cinematography: 93/100⭐⭐ Visual Effects: 92/100⭐⭐⭐ Sound Effects: 95/100⭐⭐⭐ Art Direction & Set Decoration: 95/100⭐⭐ Original Scores: 91/100⭐⭐⭐ Makeup: 98/100⭐⭐⭐ Costume Design: 99/100_________________________________They've done amazing work with Infinity War and this movie ends it all. The movie was real amazing. Dramas, future travelings, character relationships, everything was perfect. The greatest moment was absolutely Portals scene. Natasha and Tony's sacrifice was really great. All the heros were dead in first movie. That was so sad. So I didn't expect they can done better drama in this movie. But actually they've done.Now this movie has cons also. Captain America's as* jokes and fat Thor was not good actually. They thought If Thor is beat Thanos in Infinity War and we need a weaken Thor. Actually they chose a bad way I think. Thor is real old character but we are not searching logic in these movies. So 5 years without fight was enough for a weaker Thor. Thor gain my respect in Infinity War and now that fat Thor is real nonsense for me."
678,"I was avenger fan, but what I saw was really juvenile and even a 10 years kid could write better than this one, I could accept the death of 2 main characters but the end was really unacceptable, my mind can't till now ingest it.
I will give it 3 stars one for CGI, one for whole team efforts including productions team and actors and finally one for audience who wasted their 3 hours watching this trash..."
679,"I didn't like end game much. to long. to slow. to sloppy, to weak of a plot. to many cameos.thanos had to much physical power, all the other superheros got their power from outside sources, his was never explained. is it supposed to be his is born that way? even in infinity war he had to much physical strength. of which i didnt like the beginning of showing the end of 'thor, ragnorock, victorious ending being totally useless. a better ending and more tense/suspenseful scene would have been showing them fly off towards thanos ship in waiting.if thanos got his strength from some unnatural method, i missed that being explained. then why no others like him? comics say he is a titan. why no other titans?the key points in the movie's end fight scenes were far to subtle and why did iron man have to die because he used the glove? it was never explained. thanos never suffered using them, only destroying them. and so many others had it, why didn't they use it? even if it would kill them, whether they knew it would kill them or not, they could have ended it all instantly.the time travel thing was oh so sloppy. seems it was used only to go over the list of all the other movies. was more like a reunion documentary than an actual movie. bored the crap out of me. and the stupid mistakes made me upset.so now they have all the stones, with or without a glove, why did they need time travel machines to go back again to replace them? wouldnt the stones have let them do what they wanted to do, restoring any history they wished, one without thanos? and they could have brought back vision, why didnt they? etc etc etc.captain marvel was vastly wasted. so was her haircut. what was the point of that? she said she was needed elsewhere? who cares whats happening in the rest of the universe when its not going to matter after the glove puts it all back right. the only and the smartest thing about the movie was when thanos took her power stone to beat her. that was the best 10 seconds in the movie. but with that stone, they should have been equal. but then not equal because thanos isnt strong enough to smash entire ships by himself like captain marvel is. she is, without a doubt, by far the strongest character and that strength was not used.oh ya, that the glove just had to get back to him was such a joke of a cliche. again, should have been used before. the center point of the movie should have been making use of the glove by other means.thanos and the glove. he is smart enough to build a vast empire, yet he can only think to use the glove to kill. not to created a better method of existence without killing? he not so smart after all. and neither are any of the others for not suggesting something of that sort.the time travel thing should have put it all back right from the point of before thanos snapped fingers. should have gone back to the point where star lord should have shot thanos and ended it all, and then actually shoot him and end it all. of which that star lord didnt shoot him was the stupidest and weakest part of infinity wars. he was going to kill him but got so upset at him that he didnt kill him. huh? how does that work? who else would not have instantly shot thanos upon hearing such news?the only thing this movie was successful for was giving out as many paycheques as possible. the most cameos any movie ever had. did they really need to do that? showing 3 second clips at the end in the credits of each actor would have been better. at least less boring.they didnt just want to end the story line, they wanted to end my interest in it also. i watched them all just to make sure i didnt miss anything that might have been worth while. some of the others were just great. this one was far from it."
680,"If you expect to watch a movie that is almost as good as Infinity Game then you will be very disappointed... A film that should be at most 90 minutes length it has been pushed at 180 minutes and they felt that time with lot of non-sense talking without actionDidn't worth the money spent to watch the movie, not even the time.. Even if I was offered to watch it again for free, I would pass the offer without any hesitation.."
681,"Walking into the theater, my knees were shaking. The beginning scene when Clint's family dusted was just jaw dropping and gave you chills. The plot was a genius idea. People predicted that they went back into time but they added a ton of new things in the plot that was shocking like black widows death for the stone. The final battle was not enjoyable if your not a marvel fan. They ended each character just the way they shouldve ended. This movie is an easy 10/10."
682,Words can't even describe how good this movie is I love it I could watch it thousands time and probably will
683,"Omg, marvel smashed it with his one, such a great ending even tho I cried and hated it in my heart (lol), buf after a bit of time and understanding the impact it had. It was for the best. Hope to see the greatest character come back some day or get his own movie."
684,"Just like my headline says. Watch this masterpiece for the love of God! This and infinity war are on totally different levels to any other super hero film. And this goes one level better than infinity war, absolutely fantastic."
685,"I really enjoyed the prequel to this waste of my life(Infinity wars), the GOTG crew humour etc made it a fabulous balance.This however had no soul, it drifted in and out of morose depression and self pity for the hopeless state everyone was in, this took up a good 2 hours.
Then an idiotic and predictable battle and i cheered when i could finally get up and leave. I need to find that glove so i can get 3 hours of my life back. Waste of time."
686,"That is a typical example of a movie trying to squeeze juice out of a story that falls short.
X-men finished their old-cast franchise so much better, and darker, and better (sorry did I say better before...), yeah much better. Endgame is simply not up to par with the rest of the Marvell movies."
687,I just didn't enjoy this as much as infinity war but not a huge marvel fan. Not sure why this is getting so much hype.
688,"I think that this might be even better than infinity war, everyone gets a moment to shine, the ending is spectacular and it might be one of the best films in the Marvel cinematic universe (can't beat guardians of the galaxy though)."
689,And some parts brought me to tears. The cast was phenomenal and I think every superhero got to have their spotlight.
690,"Avengers: Endgame. Wow, feels like just yesterday I was six years old, sitting in a movie theater with my parents and watching the first Ironman movie. Man what a ride it has been. This movie may not be as exciting and action packed as Avengers: Infinity War was, but it had a tremendous story to it. Despite it being confusing, once you figure it out it was one hell of a story that will keep anyone engaged and make them want our hero's to win. Using time travel as a plot device can be risky, but Marvel has pulled it off, just like many other things we didn't think they could pull off.
Pros-
EmotionalFinal act was AMAZINGCharacter arcs were satisfyingone of the best stories in the MCUthe acting was phenomenalthe visuals were beyond amazingthe writing was amazing as wellHUGE PAYOFF OF TEN YEARS OF STORYTELLINGCons-
-Needed more action
some of the time travel plot is confusingCaps ending kind of breaks his character arc and is confusingThanos didn't have as much of a character arc but that's understandable seeing as though Marvel wanted the hero's to have more screen time-some scenes were dragged out
Overall: 9.5/10 MUST WATCH MOVIE!!!!!!!"
691,"I appreciate many desperate people want to seem ""edgy"" or ""alternative"" by defining themselves as ""different"" but really, you come off as nothing more than the representation of inadequacy. I'm not suggesting you need to love this movie or that you can't find fault, but what this and it's predecessor, Infinity War, achieved; not only in cinema, but storytelling as a whole, is laudable. This is not a stand-alone movie and requires some foreknowledge, but it's an accomplished endgame of a movie arc of over 10 years unlike any other in movie history"
692,"This was movie was the perfect way to bring together everyone, let's us know how about many of the Avengers including how the years since the snap has affected them and it allows them the ability to resolve or revisit their past. Love seeing everyone united, loved seeing the A-Force. Laughing, surprises, tears. Just perfection."
693,"Just watched the movie again at home last night. I tought I would not react the same way I did in the theater, but I was wrong. When the avengers assemble my heart was pounding again. Came to think why and figures that for me, this felt the grand finale of a great series, or of a 50+ hours movie. The culmination of a master crafted history. I'm not a marvel or superhero fan, that is why my reaction surprised so much. Just, wow!"
694,Not sure why they included all that time travel and extended fight scenes for. I think the advertisement was pretty effective when Tony Stark rolled up in his Audi. Just seems a bit overkill for a car commercial you know.
695,"Pains me to write this review, towards one of my beloved franchisesThe movie was BORING!!! When writers meet a block, they write about time machines, and really. that is where the movie flops. Before it even left the page to go on film
Lets sum up,
-1 hour and 30 minutes of recap from previous movie/boring SUPER slow amp up towards for an ending, just to explain the horrid choice of time travel
-20 minutes of action/climax, that was mostly a copy n past from earlier movies
-30 minutes of SLOW boring endingDont even get me started on Ms. Larson's flat acting, or the fact the Marvel Cannon was ignored.. Guess Capt America is now the God of Lightning? Right....
This is a disgrace to the Marvel franchise
Save your time, and money. Dont even rent this"
696,The real movie was gr8. Best work ever done by marvels
697,If you are even a remote fan of this universe you must watch this!
698,"This movie is the end of an era. I feel like I've been saying that a lot lately. First with TWD, now this, and soon Star Wars too. It's sad that certain chapters of my favorite franchises are ending, but hey, part of the journey is the end, right?I imagine that everything that could possibly be said about Endgame has already been said. It's an absolutely incredible finale to the MCU, and also lays down some set up for its near future, and possibly far future too. I could not have asked for anything better. However, there are a few things I'd change:1. ""Tony Stark built this in a cave! With a box of scraps!"" They should've had Tony use his intuition to fix the ship and get home on his own. Maybe he uses parts of Nebula to fix it temporarily. Could come in for a crash landing and have CM swoop in to help them land safely.2. Could've explored more of the repercussions of the snap. I love what they showed though, and I get the movie is already long enough as is, so this isn't a biggie.3. The female Avengers coming together to rescue Peter was a cringy and forced scene. Instead, they could've focused on other aspects of the battle because it feels like it goes so quick.4. Hulk should've had a rematch with Thanos. Instead of giving Captain Marvel two fights with Thanos, after he throws her off the first time, let Hulk jump in for a rematch. This was a fight that was sorely lacking and is Endgame's biggest missed opportunity. Given that Professor Hulk is Hulk and Banner merged, he'd be smarter so he could've put up a better fight.5. Natasha's funeral should've been alongside Tony's at the end.Given these changes, I think Endgame would've been even better. That being said, it's still one of my favorite movies ever as is. The cast were all fantastic, and the movie was action packed, but surprisingly story-driven; emotional and epic. I'm glad that we got one last movie to send the original Avengers off, but I feel that the team up movies after this almost wont be worth it. Marvel struck magic with this original team of Avengers and it's hard to believe they'll pull it off again without 3 of them. However, there are still some solo ventures to look forward to, like Black Widow, Spider-Man 3, Doctor Strange 2, Thor 4, and the TV shows on Disney+.My Rating: 10/10"
699,"The best Marvel Studios Movie ever I love the scene when ant man, professor hulk, captain America and Iron Man go to the New York battle (2012) that scene Is epic also the scene all the superheroes back (guardians of the galaxy, Wasp, Spiderman, doctor Strange, black Panther, etc)."
700,"Great movie, i could re-watch again and again without being bored. Amazing work keep it up for Stanley."
701,"Avengers endgame has perfect heartfelt and sweet exits for Iron Man and Captain America, amazing fight scenes and brilliant acting. While some may not like time travel Endgame does it in a satisfying way."
702,I would have tweaked little things here and there but overall this film can only be described as Phenomenal.
703,"For many years I have been watching every story of Marvel, the last one with a lot of interest. There can't be a better ending. Thank you Marvel..."
704,If you say it's boring then it means that you don't understand the marvel story.It is 3 hours but it feel like 1 hour if you understand the concept.Of you say dark Phoenix means you like Xmen than the marvel phase 4
705,Good movie will watch again very fun easy to watch
706,"That was my best experience from Avengers, Great Great Everything was great"
707,"Now here we are at the Endgame. Iron Man said it in Age of Ultron. Dr. Strange in Infinity War. Currently it's the second highest-grossing film of all time, relegating Titanic to third place, and is only $400M away from overtaking Avatar. And it deserves to be right up there, because all three prompted the world to get off of their records and go to the cinema to be a part of a mini cultural movement. I remember when the first Avengers movie was announced, I counted down the days until it was finally shown. Going back further, I remember when I was kid my mom would buy me comic books, most of which were X-men titles but an Avenger one would slip through once in a while. So I really don't like Iron Man because he's too steely, Cap was boring, Black Widow was here then gone, Hawkeye was too arrogant, Hulk was just green and Thor piqued my interest. But when I got a copy of Avengers West Coast, Scarlet Witch mesmerized me and Vision (all white version) got me sold. I mean a witch in love with a robot in the 90s? As an introvert teen trying to find his way in life, these are the people that accompanied me in the tiny corners of a place I'd run and hide to.It's one thing to read about them, it's another to see them alive and moving on the big screen. Or half of them alive anyway. Endgame continues on after the snap, with those left behind trying to continue on after the loss they suffered. If there's one thing negative I can say about the movie, is that the first hour showing the impact of the loss didn't resonate with me. Maybe because I knew beforehand those gone will be brought back and I just have to go through the motions to get to it. Maybe my opinion will change as I watch it again in the future.Now on to the good parts:Final warning, detailed spoilers ahead...1) Captain America wielding Mjolnir (collective gasp from the audience)
2) That shot when Thanos's army was approaching and only Captain America was left standing with a broken shield
3) ""On your left...""
4) Pepper Potts as Rescue
5) Avengers!....Assemble.
6) Ant man punching an alien ship
7) Spider-man and Iron Man hug. Remember in Homecoming Peter thought they were going to hug and Tony said we're not there yet? They're there now.
8) Passing of the gauntlet from Hawkeye to Captain Marvel
9) Scarlet Witch. The only other Avenger who could've killed Thanos if he didn't get help.
10) Captain Marvel's entry...and short hair...and destroying Thanos's warship single handedly.
11) All female Avengers rescuing Peter. People are divided about this, some saying it felt forced, that it was a little hypocritical but me, I'm here for it.
12) Captain Marvel's one on one with Thanos, that head but and Thanos needing an Infinity Stone to fend her off.
13) Steve coming back to pass on the shield to Sam.What comes next though? How do they top something as big as this? Well there are so many other story lines in the comic book they can translate into the big screen. The actors? Tom, Chad, Benedict and Brie are more than capable of soldiering on. There's also the TV series set for Loki, Bucky and Sam, and Scarlet Witch and Vision. Let's also not forget that Disney now hold the rights to X-Men. So my prediction of still talking about the MCU well way into my 50s is starting to become possible. We might've gotten Endgame, but it seems the game has just begun."
708,"It might just be a tiny,teensy,little bit overrated.like0.001%"
709,"Amazing film The best in the world
I watched the movie for more than five times but the end was sad with the death of Iron Man!"
710,It was Wonderful but you basically ignored Thor and turned him into comic relief
711,"This movie was (like the title suggests) overhyped. Following the events of Infinity War, which was better btw, half of the people on earth are dead. The first hour of the movie just consisted of long silent/not-so-sad/emotional pauses in dialogue that was filled with the main theme of ""its over. Thanos did what he said he'd do. We have to move on and stop crying over it"". Boring. To push this movie into gear, Marvel really scraped the bottom of the barrel. A rat. Yes, a rat is responsible for the events to follow the rat's actions. The ant-man was trapped in another dimension for 5 years and was then brought back because a normal rat stepped on a certain button triggering the return of ant-man along with the idea of time travel. No one in this universe has ever thought of time travel ever. But I digress. On top of this, captain marvel is a bratty super hero who only helps when it's convenient. I waited a full hour and 15 minutes to see the most boring super hero fight another version of himself. That's right, captain america. Everyone's favorite super hero with nuclear steroids. Overall: overhyped, bad storytelling at times, and an unnecessary amount of scenes. My 2 favorite parts were the final battle and black widow's death. Good. An unneeded character with the ability to fight good and shoot perfect. Gee what other super hero has those traits."
712,"So dissappointed. Was expecting a blast of a film. Cutting film time down by half hour/hour might have made it better. Only the last hour was ok, but expected much more with that also. Storyline not great either. Previous Avengers films much better. Such a shame. Waste of money really. Expectation I guess has earned its box office takings."
713,"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.Rating.Score : 8.9/10Grade : A"
714,"Ok so first off the bat.. I'm not a big fan of superhero films.. I've enjoyed a few but I'm no fanboy.
Seeing men in tights with big letters on their chests just doesn't do it for me.
But I do like Batman Begins as an example of some guy in tights still been a good film.. I like gritty and a little dark my super heros.
I liked some of the X-Men franchise. (I,II, Future Past..) These were sometimes intelligent and interesting.
Sadly to me the whole Avengers franchise has felt like a dumbed down version of the X-Men films..
It's basically a lot of ego centric stereotypes wise cracking at each other and showing off..Sadly that's what I got from watching this.
The first hour was terrible.
Spoilers potentially!
It gets better in the second half for a while.
The actors show some emotion! Wow.. some years are shed. The wooden acting still shines through however..
I mean I'm surprised at the high ratings for this film.
It seems like everyone a just forgiven the huge plot holes, poor acting and unnatural script writing and ultra predictable stereotypes .. and everything that's bland and wrong with this film... Because...
It cost a boat load of money? Has a lot of secrecy around the ending(s)?
I actually stopped watching with about 30 mins left.. after the big battle where everyone is thrown together to fight off this guy who by that time we don't even care what happens to him anymore anyway.. it's all just a big mess if you ask me.
I really don't get it.
So many plot holes and WTF moments?
It's just all so wooden..
Like Guardians of the Galaxy but less funny, fun or relatable.
The CGI was disappointing. The hulk character had no life in him.. and neither did the actors sadly.
Half of the planets population is wiped out by badguy.
Avengers just sit around and wise crack at each other like it's just another day and another baddie to get.?!
It's just silly. So so silly."
715,"2hours, no joke.. on a story that struggled to be interesting and felt disattached to the universe most of the time. Then the action begins and you're like finally something is happening! But if you're looking for a well orchestrated and good battles versing Thanos' generals like infinity war well there's none of that they all die as soon as they appear basically. Just like the cameos of the avengers who disappeared, almost as pointless but only over shadowed by Captain Marvel and her 2min total feature time.Then there's the plot holes, e.g. Thanos manages to come to future with his ship full of goons..how did he shrink his ship? (Like the GoG ship in which hawkeye had in his hand.. nope they all came inside it). Cap staying in an alternative past so there was 2 Captains in that timeline then and a Mjonir, but some how that Cap is an old man in their timeline.I love marvel and how they planned for this moment all along. Just a shame that it was rushed and crammed with rubbish finaleto it all."
716,"If I had a time stone I'd get those 188 minutes back. If I had a space stone I'd patch over the countless plot holes that I witnessed. Not even a reality stone could create a world where Tony Stark perfectly executes time travel with no prior knowledge of it, and for standard rules of time travel to be ignored afterwards. If I had a power stone I'd pummel the writers heads in for very little action, poor pace and zero explanation of how Captain America single handedly returned all the stones to the exact time and place they were taken. If me or a friend could get the soul stone, I'd jump so I wouldn't have to watch that garbage again. If I had the mind stone, I'd make sure nobody else chose to experience it either."
717,"The movie unsuccessful attempted to get sensual but it was way from it ,it felt like a roller coaster with the sequence of action, too many things happening in a short segment that will throw you off from enjoying the movie , it is too long and that tells you something , too many characters , lol you will get lost, like wow this a way odd. If you decide to watch it avoid the 3D version. Honestly , it was way below my expectations ."
718,"After all these years THAT is what we get? A movie that makes no sense whatsoever, Because every time i try to figure something out about the movie another plothole appears.. X-Men3 The Last Stand is a masterpiece compared to Endgame and thats saying something!
3 stars only for Tom Holland, love him as Spiderman"
719,Amazing movie really entertaining.....but it has a very slow first half......and the movie would be quite boring and meaningless if not for its 22 support movies.
720,A movie to appease the masses the hulk is weaker than a nursing home patient and Thor throws out more one liners than Bill Burr forget about this please please love me movie and go outside and ride your bike or pull some weeds out.
721,Play Avengers: Endgame! It is fast and easy to view! A good way to spend your time. Be the best!
722,"I never have seen any movie in life that has such a great action and awesome fantasy , I am speechless and all I can say is bravo and will done."
723,"Wow, just Wow! This movie has it all and needs to be watched PERIOD!!"
724,"Best superhero movie created ever it has besrt screenplay, story, action and full entertainment like a perfect package"
725,"I just watched this for the second time, (first was in the theater) and wow, i cant Believe that this was 3 hours, its sooo good, it goes by so fast! i loveed every part ! all the throw backs to previous MCU movies, this movie manages to be the funniest and most heart breaking movie within the MCU. i don't have much thats bad to say... i did not like stan lees cameo, captain marvel is so blah, and besides that, its perfect!i don't see any body who calls them self a Marvel fan could not enjoy this movie, that just blows my mind...."
726,"I am a big marvel fan. When I saw infinity war's ending I was immediately excited for this movie. This was easily my most anticIpated movie of the year and probable of all time. When tickets went on sale I got some for the midnight premiere immdiately. And somehow dispite my high expections this movie destroyed them and created a even better movie then I could have imagined.I loved every second of this movie. Even the first act were most people have complaints I loved. The second act is better then the first but man that final act is just masterpiece. Every cast member from beginning to end is amazing with Robert Downey Jr and Chris Even's being standouts. And thats not easy since I think everyone gave their best performance here and are all able to draw emotions from you. Now some directions charectors take will be not suite everyone. In fact how the avengers deal with the events of infinity war isn't gonna go well for everyone. But I for one loved it. Lead to a few cheer moments. But if you wanna talk about cheer moments man that final act. No spoilers but I wanted cheer at many moments. Two moments I nearly jumped out of my set. But while it's mostly laughs and smiles when this movies wants you to feel man it'll make you feel. If you've been a long time fan (you've probable already seen it but anyway) you will choke up I know I did and I feel no shame admitting it.If you want max enjoyment out of this film. Watch the rest of the movies. I know it sounds demanding but it's worth it. Cause you'll understand meaning behind stuff. I saw it with my dad and the two moments I nearly jumped out of my seat over he was thinking ""Ah ok"" so yes do watch the other movies if you haven't before you see this one.In the end Avengers: Endgame is in my opinion is one of my favourite movies of all time and the best marvel movie to date and I dought that will change. I know I didn't say much about the movie but I'm trying to be spoiler-free and the trailers show like nothing of the movie and thats what I based my can I talk about this ot not kinda mind set. But I can't describe how satisfied I was. This truely was an end of an era and I all I can say is I am so glad to be apart of it. To follow these charectors and become connected to them and then to finally see the conculsion thia masterpiece of a story was more then worth the wait."
727,"Endgame has surpassed Avatar for the highest grossing film of all time. Not only this is the best movie in the MCU, this is probably the greatest movie of all time. How fascinating that Tony stark died after their mission was completed, the first 2 hours were great, the last hour was legendary. The story just didn't flow with me.Last hour is epic! Loved the ending credits sequence with each of the actors and their signatures. Definitely a wonderful film. I couldn't find much wrong with it outside of nitpicking. This is definitely a once in a generation experience but Natasha really hurts... that one still messes with me. After Iron Man's death ""Whatever it takes"" hits you a lot harder. I loved what they did with most characters. My only complaint being Steve and Natasha, but everything else I was satisfied with. I just wanna also say that if people are going to be disappointed with Tony creating time travel and Bruce helping out big time, then they're gonna have so many complaints with Mr. Fantastic if they end up adding him and the others into the MCU now that they have the rights. I absolutely loved the movie. Loved how well they gave me closure over the entire journey they've brought us on. One of my favorite superhero movies and one of my favorite movie going experiences so far. I really admire them sacrificing Black Widow over Hawkeye. Hawkeye has a family, which would have made his sacrifice sad, but in a very cliche way. Nat had NOBODY aside from the other Avengers. Someone who nobody besides the main heroes would mourn sacrificing themselves to save half of the universe is so much more powerful than it would have been with virtually ANY other Avengers character"
728,"This film is very, very great and is the end of 10 years of a series of superheroes. Thanks Marvel"
729,What do I say this movie in incredible I started watching marvel movies around when the first avengers movie came out ever sense I seen everyone of them
730,"I'm assuming the low ratings are by comic book nerds. This movie was amazing. A laughed out loud, by myself, many times and cried a lot. I'm really surprised by how much considering this is just a block buster super hero movie. The thing is, I actually like movies. And I know they are entertainment. Are there holes in the time travel plot? Sure, but who cares. Just use your imagination to fill in the holes. Or don't think about it too much. It's not real life folks. I'm just grateful I live in the exact period of time where movies like this are possible. It's amazing what they can do. Imagine someone from the 1920's or 1820's saw this? Be grateful. This movie was a masterpiece. If you want less plot holes, watch a film, or read a book. This is a movie. And a damn good one."
731,"I can't say more than that I have enjoyed every single second! People and even some critics can't stop complaining about the length of this movie, which doesn't line up to the fact that this is the end (together with far from home) of an era containing 22 movies! What else is there to say? Well, I didn't have such a great time in cinema for a year, the last one was Infinity War;)
To come to an end: Every emotion was affected by this movie, literally EVERY emotion! From joy to anger, over to fear, ending in sadness...This is one of the best movies in the past 7 years! So if you haven't seen it yet: Go ahead!!!"
732,You obviously didn't understand the film if you hate it.
733,"Watched crying and over and over!This is one of the best movies in the m marvel universe, I will never forget this movie."
734,"It is a beautiful film and worth watching and has a special artistic touch I swear.....
Reda El Alaoui"
735,"So much to see here, lots going on. First movie in years where I did not allow myself a 5 minute potty break. amazing and original and impactful. the best!"
736,"This was obviously the best MCU film to date and im pretty sure everybody that saw this can agree. Without spoiling it there are some very sad moments but thats the most i can say. The whole story was great and it was just as good as any other great Marvel film. Even being a non-marvel kinda guy i actually liked the whole avengers series and i thought this was a good end to this 4 movie series. Watching these movies changed my mind about the whole MCU movies and i thought they were cool. Still not a huge fan but i enjoyed them for the most part. This movie is just a legend, enough said."
737,"I 100% didn't feel that this movie is 3h long, Though this will be good to watch at home, Endgame is one of those movies that was made to be a cinema experience, in 3D or not (but it was better in 3D). I believe in most of the developments and paths the characters chose. For a movie with so many characters and converging plots, Endgame doesn't feel too packed."
738,"The movie has a ton of plotholes and things that you'll think about after the movie. That being said you should enjoy this movie if you're a Marvel fan. Many great actors, superheroes, action, etc. Must watch if you've been keeping up with all of the other MCU movies."
739,"You know a film is good when it manages to make three hours absolutely fly by. 'Avengers: Endgame' does this in spades, making its gargantuan run-time seem as fast as a snap of the fingers. While it is properly pacy, this doesn't mean that it's a constantly moving, action driven piece in the same vein as its predecessor 'Avengers: Infinity War' (2018). Instead, it's a much more character focussed, dramatic film and in my eyes it's all the better for it. While 'Infinity War' was great in its own right, 'Endgame' feels like a completely different beast all together; the two are undeniably separate entities. The characters have always been what makes the MCU stand out and 'Endgame' arguably has the best character work in one of these films to date. Rather unusually for a picture of this ilk, it is focussed more on that than any action or spectacle, both completing arcs from the entire franchise and establishing new ones in itself. Each of the core players are focussed upon greatly here, which is extremely involving, especially to long-time fans of the series. That's not to say that the film is devoid of any action at all though; it comes eventually and is very much worth the wait. The third act action sequence is probably the most satisfying moment of the entire franchise and proves that Marvel knows how to stage these things very well, while still keeping a keen focus on character. There's also a lot of fan service throughout, but this hardly a bad thing at all. Being able to reference even the lesser known and liked films of the franchise and trust that the majority of the audience will be able to understand is something that Marvel wears with pride here. 'Endgame' is for the fans after all and it never forgets this, yet (unlike 'Infinity War') there's enough groundwork laid out here to make it really work on its own as an individual story, too. Overall, it's an outstanding conclusion to the 'Infinity Saga', satisfyingly wrapping everything up, making it feel like a definitive 'end', yet still leaving you excited for what's to come (the MCU isn't going anywhere any time soon). It's big-budget blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best and one of the greatest Marvel films to date. 9/10"
740,It was a cool movie and intresting. Not surprised it smashed box office records. RIP Stan Lee
741,"I will not call it a fitting ending.. but it was definitely beautiful. The movie ensures that every character is given enough space, but not too much. The ending battle is epic! But what stole my heart was the credits. It's a must watch for the franchisee fans."
742,"I am usually a really big fan of anything marvel but seriously what a crappy way to end this saga... Why did the writers need to add in all of the SJW rubbish in the movie? And what's the go with captain marvel? Terrible casting, made me dislike the movie even more... And ruining Thor? He's usually one of the most enjoyable characters to watch. And they turned him into a useless drunk. I really don't understand the high ratings.. Please don't believe the hype."
743,"The spine of a movie is the scenario and similar to the recent popular superhero movies, this movie's is jelly. It does not include creativity and smartly combined events.First of all, weak script writers hold on to time travel concept in order to make
writing easier with lack of creativity. They do not need to stick onto a logic - they can just explain everything by time travel. This movie has Terminator Genisys impressions which I think was the least fun to watch of Terminator series.Second, I hate repeated usage of ""Deux ex Machina"" in these superhero movies. This a concept which should strictly be avoided due to lacking creativity, but trending contrarily. At the end of Batman vs Superman; while they were both fighting against Doomsday and losing, Wonder Woman pops up and saves their day.
In Avengers, when the superheroes were losing against Thanos' spaceship, Captain Marvel comes from the space unexpectedly and fragments the spaceship into parts. Why was she not around until they were beaten enough and lose hope? The writers do not leave us without a logic expression: She was busy saving other planets. But Captain Marvel is not the only superhero to poup at the end. Zounds of ""good"" superheroes enter into the scene from some magical gates to fight against the ""bad"" army. (impressions from Lord of the Rings Ghost Army - but it had creativity and logic within)1 sentence summary of the movie: While good heroes are losing against bad, many other good heroes appear somehow and they all save the world together.There is another controversial trend rising : Instead of creating black superheroes from scratch (which requires creativity), white heroes hand the superhero job over to black people. In Spider Man into the Spider Verse, the regular Spider Man hands the job to a black youngster.
This movie follows the trend, too. At the end, Captain America assigns a black guy as the new Captain America.
However, we are not seeing movies with black superheroes in the lead role. (Always side roles)
If the filmmakers are sincere, the lead superheroes in following movies must be acted by black people (especially Spider Man and Captain America),
otherwise this trend is just a forced gesture.Oh, the movie also does not skip emphasizing another cliche: the of the importance of family.So that the filmmakers have $400M to spend on a movie, I believe they can also spend some money, effort and time on creating authentic, non-cliche scenarios without cutting corners.If you are just seeking a vast variety of superhero collision without thinking much, go see it.
But if you are seeking a movie with an original, creative scenario keeping focus on a particular character (as in Terminator 1&2, Avatar and Alita), avoid wasting 3 hours of your life."
744,"A nice production for those only interested in action sequences but not so great for those wanting closure of the Marvel story line...The best part of the film is that it brings together all previous Marvel movies to drive the plot... And the worst part of the film is it brings together all previous marvel movies to drive the plot... because it seems the production team don't really know the stories that ran before...
Anyone who follows the stories (from the movies, not the comic) will know there are much easier time points to collect each of the stones... The drama created by making this 'collection plan' much more difficult than it needed to be, added at least an unnecessary hour to the movie...Other plot points that didn't sit well with me and reduced the enjoyment of the movie, are...1) Thanos 'killed' 50% of the ""good guys"" and he's hailed as a super villain... Tony 'killed' 100% of the bad guys and he's a hero? Don't heroes learn from their own pain and sufferings and on principal refuse to inflict the same misery on others?Surely, other than Thanos and a few of his more loyal subjects, the rest are simply following orders...
(On another tangent, Thanos seems to really believe in his cause because after he killed off half the universe, including his people I believe, he lived alone and not with an army of servants and subjects for him to rule as a king... That's honourable...)2) they didn't reverse time... Just brought everyone back with a 5 year time gap... People should not behave normally when loved ones they haven't been with for 5 years suddenly reappear... Those who have survived those 5 years didn't get their memories and aging removed, right?3) how did Thanos and his gang all time travel while the avengers are so calculative about one person 2 trips?A 30 second segment showing Thanos instructing his people to mass produce the Pym solution for time travel would have closed this plot hole.4) always disliked Captain Marvel because she is so powerful that no other super heros need to exist...
And still... She is so concerned about other worlds that she couldn't be bothered to be present for the start of the biggest battle her home planet is about to face... when every known superhero showed up at the right time and right place...And later, the battle actually showed she's not all that great... So her weakness is she sweats the small stuff, can't see the big picture and not available/functional when needed?4) If they can bring back Gamora, why can't they find a timeline to bring back Natasha and even Tony? Superheros really don't like to plan and think things through... (Same as when they don't seek the easiest points to retrieve the stones... With zero time pressure for planning...)5) speaking of Gamora, the Gamora who came with Thanos don't know the guardian crew at all... so even though she's not 'evil' like the old Nabula, she wouldn't be friendly like she knows they are the 'good guys'...
Based on the time line, she doesn't even know Quill yet... So she should view him and them as the enemy in the battle...6) Nabula... If she killed her historic self, shouldn't she just drop dead in the new timeline?
Grandfather paradox anyone?7) what's with that special scene where all the women heroes joined together to show their power?
To me, that's totally sexist...Speaking for myself, I enjoy male and female superheros for their individual powers and weaknesses... Once a person reaches superhero status, in my mind, they crease to represent a gender (other than those gender/age stereotypes to generate laughs and endearment...)Having al female scene shows me that the production team are so hung up on being politically correct that they generate a reverse sexist scene to feel they are all inclusive... Sigh...
These same people want a female James Bond / Indiana Jones but not a male Mary Poppins / Eliza Doolittle... And they think the rest of the world is sexist...
The self proclaimed tolerant and inclusive are starting to paint themselves into a corner...8) while it's nice to see Bruce and the Hulk getting along...an unangry Hulk takes away what makes the Hulk a character...Remember these famous words? ""You wouldn't like me when I'm angry""... that's gone now... Sigh...9) speaking of which... Why on earth would the Hulk go into battle in an amour suit? Surely that was made for Bruce when the Hulk refused to come out to play?How would the Hulk fit inside and why would he need it? That's taking power away from the Hulk and it pissed me off...10) if the Ancient One knows and sees all possibilities... Even knowing when Dr Strange will show up... How did she not see the Hulk coming to ask for the stone?11) Loki's escape with the tesseract surely would have spun an alternate time line... Since there is only ONE tesseract... Then much of the previous stories wouldn't really make sense if Loki had it almost immediately after he lost it ...12) Captain America basically anointed the Falcon to be the next Capt? *Roll eyes*...I think the Falcon already has a lot going and Bucky should be a better successor...
In any case, we won't see Thor succeed the iron Man suit because he doesn't really need the extra edge...
Bucky is a super soldier in the same vein as the Capt. And should have been his first choice for a successor...13) did Captain America just ignore world events for the last century while he hid with Peggy? (& what did he do after she died... Surely she can't live as long as he... Wouldn't he simply come back to the 'present' having enjoyed a full and loving life, and not yet as old as he became?) ... The Production team might wish to rewatch Highlander...😋He never got the itch to help the 'current' Captain America fight injustice? He resisted the urge to pass on information that might help the avengers as he had lived through all the events before? (I know, I know... Can't/shouldn't change history... But how could he resist, for someone like him who loves to lecture and lead?)14) the biggest plot hole of all and the one that buried the movie for me... is...The Thanos that was in the battle came from before the previous movie right? (Infinity war)...If Tony Stark kills Thanos in this movie... That means none of the previous movie plot could have happened... Nobody was ""killed off"" (not even Loki...)... Nobody lost/gained 5 years of their lives... Thor didn't need to get fat, none of this movie should even get started...That's the devil when idiot film makers dabble with time travel in a non-time-travel movie... Adding this means they can't take care of the details properly...The above are just the main plot annoyances... And there and many other smaller ones which prevented a truly epic movie experience...3 hours is a long movie and much of it unnecessary if they tightened the plot to make more sense...So, while the movie is good...I wouldn't selectively watch it again... Which to me is the benchmark of a great movie.I'm torn in giving a rating... I want to give 7 based on the scale of the production and emotional ties it has on me from all the previous Marvel movies...But the constant I'm jolted with throughout the film killed much of my buzz and for that I want to give it a 2... Sto be fair... it'll get a 4 overall to balance both sides..."
745,"Continuity? 350M budget and no one looking over the continuity? Hair styles, braided beard..unbraided...braided again? You need special equipment and suits to time travel, but not the bad guys who follow? No one traveling through time ages except Captain America??? SO many dragged out scenes with 'on the nose' dialog. They only made it 3 hours long to give the impression it was 'epic' when it wasn't and isn't. Making Thor a laughing bafoon who gives up being king so he can continue being fat and lazy? If you can't kill your superheroes, turn them into rejects. They'll probably reboot all the characters like they did with Spiderman... again...and again...and again."
746,"WITHOUT TIME TRAVEL!1. Thanos does not destroy the gauntlet and Thanos does not die immediately at the beginning.2. Redeeming the hate for Captain Marvel: I personally like her character. I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie. That being said they should have brought her in, had character development with the remaining Avengers team, and got to the task of taking on Thanos and reversing what had happened in Infinity War. It could turn out that her power doesn't exceed but matches Thanos' power. Another possibility is that Thanos who finally has all of the Infinity Stones learns of yet more power that the Gauntlet unleashes. So many possibilities really they never even delved into the Gauntlet and what all it could do.3. That being said they could have tackled it numerous ways without the use of time travel, i will put one scenario out there. With the added power that Captain Marvel brings to the team they could take on Thanos, somehow acquire the Time Stone from the Gauntlet and use that to reverse time. Hell they could even have a huge CGI blowout where time is traveling backwards while they are fighting the mighty Thanos. Time reverses until they get back to the point where Infinity War left off. With all Marvel characters present they could have the biggest battle scene a Marvel movie has had to date. One where they tie up the contract issues with the actors and the ones that have to die could have died during the battle. So many variations they could have gone with and made it a much more edge-of-your-seat ride than what they put out, which was mostly boring, filled with plots holes and left me underwhelmed to say the least. I have no plans to re-watch Endgame in the near future, if at all.In conclusion i just wrote this in five minutes on a lazy Sunday afternoon after a week of brooding about how bad Endgame was. Marvel had an entire team of hundreds, probably thousands of people to put out a better product than what we got. It was a cop out film and everyone involved should be embarassed that that was the final product after so many years of building this exciting franchise."
747,"First thing is Thor is a stronger character that can make huge changes without stark's Death
Second thing is captain America can have Thor's power because oden whispered to his hamer that one will have it only
So the mistakes I saw there was Thor was useless and captain America got his power
Third thing is captain marvel didn't make any changes so the purpose of this character is making money !!!!"
748,"I think Marvel films are fine, I understand loving them I really do. Spider-Man 2 is my personal favourite, but please stop giving these movies a 10/10. Endgame is a 7 at best. It's probably the most flawed Avengers film story wise. It's popcorn fun, but it's like if we let Fast & Furious or Transformers films in the top 250. Meanwhile 2001: A Space Oddisey is lower than Infinity War."
749,"There isn't too much in the way of suspense or surprises when it comes to the story, but there are some shocking moments and funny lines in this epic finale. Again, like many of the best Marvel films, the holes and flaws are covered up with humor and fan service, making everything okay. That being said, I did prefer Infinity War to this film, which really misses the leads of the other Marvel franchises that were ""snapped"" out. Overall, however, there are only a few ways you can wrap up the main story of the MCU, and this was a solid direction."
750,"Tremendous, it never ends and u always hope it's finishing"
751,"I honestly can't understand how anybody could dislike this movie. It is without a doubt, one of the greatest films in history. Sure there were a few flaws, but no movie is perfect. From the character development to the action scenes to the comedy, it just succeeded all the expectations that it needed to."
752,"IDK BUT THANOS WON :(
So how?With the Infinity Gaunlet"
753,"I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but from my point of view Infinity War is way better than Endgame. I do feel like Endgame tried to copy some great scenes from Infinity War, yet those ones were miserably executed.
The only thing amazing about Endgame is Captain Marvel and her new short haircut, but that's about all that shines on Endgame :(. I am really disappointed, I really hoped for something better and not that predictable.
Unfortunately Endgame lies in a category of movies for which even the trailer is better than the movie.."
754,"I'm not a hardcore ""Avengers"" fan. But being a movie fan means I am of course caught up in the buzz around this. Unfortunately I feel this is purely aimed at the mega fans, and I can imagine even some of them being disappointed.It all starts out promising. Setting things up and being as good humoured as usual. But then the time travelling stuff sets in. At first it sounded like this was going to be fun. But as it marched on it felt like way to much was being thrown in there, and the entire story (and a few of the previous movies) seem to get trashed in the chaos. I love time travel movie's if they setup some rules and stick to them. But do alot of contradicting stuff and you lose me.Still. There are a few surprises, and the big finale is still amazing to look at. The Ending does seem fitting, but the stink from the middle part of the movie stays throughout, and i was left scrathcing my head at least a couple of times more with revelations at the end.Oh, and I'm not sure what I think about the hulk in this. He seemed like he was just there for laughs. Unintentional or otherwise."
755,"I'm happy other reviewers see this movie for what it is. I've watched this movie 3 times to make sure my feelings were true and they are this movie made me upset and disappointed. I hated what they did to Thor, yes i understand he was depressed and all but they really did him dirty and it wasn't funny or appreciated. They nerfed Hulk, and he got no rematch with Thanos he didn't even do anything Hulky. The plot was too stupid and confusing. What happened with Cap? How is he an old man now that popped up out of nowhere in the end? How did Thanos and his whole entire army get to the future? Did Dr. Strange know that a rat would ultimately save mankind? How waa strombreaker not able to do anything against Thanos? Why is Thanos stronger WITHOUT the gauntlet?
Also Captain Marvel was pretty useless in this movie with that nauseating haircut.
My beloved Black Widow is dead and didn't get a funeral or anything! Why didn't they bring her back from a different time lime or whatever like they did Gamora?
And Bucky got robbed too! He should have picked up the shield not Falcon.
I could go on and on for days. I think everyone is so caught up in the hype they didn't actually give any thought to what they were watching. Well at least I still have Infinity War and of course the OG Avengers to watch."
756,"Like all of us I couldn't wait to see this movie! Infinity war had set up what I thought would be an epic three hours of chasing downThanos, culminating in one of the greatest endgames in the history of Hollywood,how wrong I was. The first hour and a half left me cold in my seat with some of the soppiest non relatable garbage I have ever seen. The friendly Hulk was an absolute joke, fair enough I knew that Banner and the Hulk would find a common ground but he, they became a non entity in the film. The same can be said for Thor, a fat self lothing slob who brought nothing to the table, even in the while action packed far too short final battle! The way all the fallen characters just appeared after Iron Man took control of the Infinity stones was hugely underwhelming after taking what seemed infinity to suffer through the non funny slapstick farewell from the actors who for their own egos, took over from the action heroes I had enjoyed so much in the past, culminating in the sickly sweet farewell from captain America. Just another hyped up movie that had so much promise ruined by the greedy Hollywood executives!"
757,What to say about this film good points its an avengers movie bad points it was not what you would expect from an avengers movie was complete rubbish from start to finish
758,"This has to be one of the most overrated films I've ever seen, it was long boring and tiring to watch. The story was boring slow and at times just felt unnecessary. I genuinely don't understand how people can say it was a 10/10 film."
759,"After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time but this movie fall flat on the face.SPOILER ALERT - dont read further if you have not seen the movie.So many plot holes from the beginning.Why we need antmen to remind people about time travel? Thats the first thing people will think if something like that ever possible. Instead they could have made use of ant men and goto quantum world to rebuild the atoms of broken stones.So much screentime given to side charecters. Where do people go after they vanish? And wouldnt they be confused after they return to a different timeline? Or they will just jump into fight? Wouldnt be half of Thanos's soldiers be back again fighing other avengers?Why world is still deserted after 5 years? People stopped working?How Captain A is able to use Thors Hammer?Whats the use of Thanos killer weapon? Just to kill unarmed and weak Thanos?Why Thanos was given no screentime? I would have loved to see him more often in 3 hrs movie.Why Thanos is so dumb? Even after getting all the stones he mindlesly fight and not use any power of stone? Even when he already seen his future and know how to use stone power.Just a fanboy movie. Waste of my time and money."
760,The movie is unlike its precursors unamusing and dull.
761,"I watched this film on the opening day and I left disappointed. This movie is too fast paced and too easy plot with tons of loopholes. Infinity War was a great film compared to it and Guardians of Galaxy, Ironman series, Captain America 1 were far better movies than this one. Endgame is running on hype and the total collection seems huge because of way too overpriced movie tickets. This movie is made for only children of age under 12."
762,"This is the most poorly written of all the Avengers movies. It is action scene after action science with a few lines and a great deal of flashbacks to original Marvel Superhero films. This is the worst time travel movie I have ever viewed. TV Shows such as Outlander and Game of Thrones deal with time travel and flash backs respectively. This movie could have had an hour of superfluous action removed and more money could have been utilized for writers to make the story more concise and give us a chance to say goodbye to our favorite Marvel superheroes. In addition, the costumes were cheesy and as I viewed the film in IMAX I noticed that the costumes didn't fit the characters well. For example, the most ubiquitous costume problem was that their boots appeared to be two sizes too big. The sets were not convincing while the cinematographer would show the whole set then zoom in on a character's oversized boots. By the time, the war with Thanos began during the last 45 minutes it was total chaos with Tony Stark martyring himself for all Avengers and humanity. The writing, in the end, failed to unify all the films. I hoped the writers could pull together the twenty two film collection with a solid introduction, body, and conclusion. The end product was too much action, very little dialogue (except boring hazing), cheesy costumes, poor sets, too many character's whose fate was unclear."
763,"Thats really end of game 👆👆to Thanos
Get well soon very very Best of This Series"
764,Despite the negative responses from people with low IQs this movie brought the epic final battle to life! Most of the dim witted comments come from people that have no idea that you have to get from point A to point B and build a story.
765,"To say the least, it brought so many story lines together and had brought the MCU to a rebirth of sorts. Saddening parts like the loss of Tony Stark and the end of Steve Roger's reign as Captain America. 10/10 . ( I would have given it a 12/10 but the scale doesn't go high enough). Amazing, well thought out and emotional movie."
766,"This is the best movie i ever watch by Marvel production, i think they never gonna pass this movie. ALL RECOMMENDATION if you're fan of superheros"
767,"Does it entertain from beginning to end? Yes. Does it makes you laugh as much as it makes you cry? Yes. Is the acting top notch? Yes. Are the special effects, score and set-pieces the absolute best modern cinema has to offer? Yes. Is the script an absolute masterpiece that makes justice to every character in it? Yes. Is it the best movie ever made? Yes."
768,I like all those magic tricks out of from theirs hands and good teams against bad teams.
769,"I won't say much but this was the greatest movie theater experience I've had since Avatar. I see there's a lot of one star terrorists who would never be satisfied, or who only believe in arthouse type movies that are non-fiction. If that's you, then ignore this review. We'll both be better off.The emotion, the tender love between characters who have been developed over the last 15 years, and just the general willingness to sacrifice everything for the greater good truly make the writing click in both infinity war and endgame. In addition, the writers were careful not to make it a requirement to see all 21 films leading up to this. Yeah, seeing infinity war and probably age of ultron is a must, and it will help you enjoy it more to remember some of the references from Thor: The Dark World, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the two Guardians of the Galaxy films, but generally, infinity war explains anything you may not now going into it.As for the common complaint that 3 hours is too long, I will disagree. This is an end to a series on an unprecedented scale and it is totally worth your time."
770,"How you rate this other than a 10 is beyond me. I love infinity war and it's probably more #1 but this is a perfect film. I laughed,cried and cheered. The ending sets up the future movie's which I'm excited for. I'm assuming the black widow movie will be a origin story. Definitely worth watching!!!"
771,"Not as action-packed as Infinity War but the story and writing are the best of this generation.The action doesn't seem as forced as it does in other marvel movies, it's obvious that the directors wanted to focus more on the story and writing of the film and that's understandable judging by how Infinity War ended and how that would put a lot of weight and depth to the characters and story of Endgame. Don't get me wrong there is a reasonable and realistic amount of action in the first 2 hours of the movie, enough for it to be a 1980s masterpiece.The last hour of this movie, just left me speechless; I cannot begin to say how proud I am to be alive to witness this unforgettable hour. It includes everything a masterpiece should include, from amazing camerawork to important representation to jaw dropping action to a rollercoaster of emotions, Making the audience jump, shake, smile, scream, cheer, sweat, and of course cry as if they are inside the movie and witnessing everything.The ending just fits perfectly like a 22-movie puzzle, like every single little thing that's happened in this movie and every MCU movie before it is just a piece of the puzzle and now that the puzzle is finally complete, you feel satisfied and surreal due to what you've just experienced. This is a spoiler-free review so if you have not seen Avengers: Endgame yet, I suggest that you do because trust me, you will not forget this one."
772,I don't know what should I say.. Time travel in this movie has problem. But this is the best quality of this film
773,I want to give it 10 stars but the fact that it has to force some political views (ex. The clearly forced all female Avenger scene) means it doesn't deserve a 10 star rating.
774,"As a Marvel fan I had my hopes up at 100% for this film being so invested throughout the years with the characters and their stories and I gotta say I was not disappointed at all!This is the only film I've seen in theaters more than once and for great reasons, it truly doesn't disappoint. This and Infinity War were the only films where I physically automatically jumped out of my seat when something epic would happen and the callbacks to other movies were fan-service to the max!The plot is ridiculous in its premise and does require more suspension of disbelief than all of the other Marvel movies that came before this one and it executes it's the plot perfectly with enough high-stakes and humor to be a fully immersive experience.This truly is a once in a lifetime film event and is the perfect ending to a near-perfect saga."
775,"Wow. this is more of an event than a movie. it's a spectacle. i seriously can't believe they pulled this off. what a great movie. gave me the feels more than any other MCU movie. such a perfect conclusion to the journey we set upon 11 years ago. MCU is too awesome. probably the most consistently successful thing i love. i'm so proud of them. they've brought me so much joyamazing heart. intriguing story that is so vast and has so many moving parts, it's a ""marvel"" they pulled it off (lame lol). filled with beautiful shots. the acting was fantastic by so many of these actors, with some of the best performances they have ever given inside the MCU, especially downy, johansson, evans, rudd, gillan and renner. some of the music gave me the chills. lots of goosebump-inducing moments. so much character depth with some great arcs.a year later i am still in awe that marvel pulled this off. so many movie series and tv shows have us fully invested to an epic conclusion, only to let us down (ahem GoT ahem). this delivered on all counts. and the fact that i've given a very positive rating to every movie in the MCU except one.... i honestly feel so lucky. (5 viewings, 5/22/2020)
SPOILERS
had the most epic battle scene in the MCU, and maybe ever in any movie. i still like the civil war air port battle more, but this final battle was definitely more epic.this movie had three amazing conclusions to three characters and their overall arc in the series. one is a tragic sacrifice, one is a heroic save-the-world moment, and one is possibly the most satisfying happy ending i've ever witnessed. like not just movies, even in life rofl. bravo. we will miss you all. (still paranoid about putting who, even a year later lol)"
776,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is the eagerly awaited one, has a good amount of emotions in it, making you highly emotional in the final scenes.It is very effective, though it takes momentum in the final hour, building the story in the first half.To read full click Here"
777,"I'm not fan of this kind of movies. My hasband made me to watch it in cinema.
All I can say Chris Pratt fantastic actor, very talented"
778,The CGI part is messy but the Avenger lovers would like it.
779,"The movie awesome don't miss out especially for marvel fans . For general audience also this movie will give a fantastic experience, the core of the movie is the climax, this movie have a ultimate and emotional ending from other 22 marvel movies."
780,One of the greatest Marvel films created. Spoiler alert but it was emotional when RDJ died saving others.
781,"No spoiler brief review for fans and non fans:-If you are a Marvel fan, then you know you shouldn't miss this movie so please watch it before anyone spoils it for you. Even if someone does spoil it, the movie is worth watching for its spectacular special effects, music by Alan Silvestri and stellar performances by the cast. The 3D version of the movie is nice as the 3D effect adds additional depth to the fight scenes and space scenes. It's a movie that has so many scenes which feel like they are there to please the fans and the scenes have a lot of emotional impact because of the character development as well as back-story that have built up the emotions throughout the years. This movie is something that should be kept in your DVD or Blu-Ray collections when officially released later on, as there are so many things in this movie which will make you want to revisit it and relive the moments. You will not get bored by this movie and might as well watch it twice or even more times in the theater.If you are not a Marvel fan or haven't watched any of the Marvel movies, the movie does tell you what happened in the Avengers Infinity War and even if you won't be able to identify with some of the characters, you can guess that Avengers are the good people and they are trying to stop the bad guy, Thanos from conquering the world and also to try and repair what he did in the Infinity War movie. The movie is worth watching for its special effects, acting, music and great production value. Some character decisions might divide the audience, so how you feel will depend on your personal attachment and expectations form a particular super hero character's story arc.This is the last Russo Bros. Marvel film according to a GamesRadar Interview and the last Stan Lee cameo (RIP). Go watch it!"
782,"The original movie was very nice and I've watched that 3 times. But Avengers in re-release is awful! Especially in hulk scene. The effects is very bad and disappointing. I wish Rosso brothers were add ""Tony Meet Morgan after The snap"" scene"
783,I liked how this movie pays tribute to all previous films either by showing similar scenes or dialogues
784,"I had intentions of what I wanted to see going into #avengersendgame, and after seeing the movie I was very pleased. The MCU knows how to bring the characters to life in a cinematic fashion that exceeded my expectations 100 times over. After investing so much in the characters for the 20 some odd movies I got emotional but a good a good emotional. I know realize why I got into film because I like telling stories that have heart. I give #avengersendgame a 9 and a half out of 10. Keep the MCU going bringing our childhood to life."
785,Love it. Everything about it is amazing movie of the year
786,"Not perfect, but still one of the best action films I've ever seen (alongside Infinity Wars) and the only film I've watched twice at the cinema. In a word, epic."
787,"Such a great film, great emotion and realism that captivates for the duration of the long run time."
788,"Avengers Infinity Was by far one of the best of these types of movies but unfortunately the conclusion missed the mark by a long shot. It was slow, boring and the dialogue except for a few funny moments was just plain flat. Captain Marvel s appearance was just out of place and added nothing. We all knew what the story was going to be but to throw this at the audience was just plain lazy. ."
789,I feel like wasted my time and money on infinity as everything was reversed through time machine. So you never know if endgame will also be reversed in next film through time machine. Further first 2 hours are soooooo boring that you can skip and join for last one hour to watch action vfx.
790,"I watched the franchise only to know some important twists in plot and to brag with people who are interested in this stuff. However, I missed some parts(because I am not a fan of Marvel).But... I didn't understand the whole movie... who were the characters who returned to life? what relations did they have to main characters? there are still many questions and it was not so exciting.so, I didn't enjoy the movie, sorry, Marvel fans."
791,"When the focus is on a few characters, this film shines but the overall focus is blurry-literally and metaphorically. I'm not kidding. Imagine one of your favorite Marvel characters having an awesome fight with some adversaries and the gigantic IMAX image on screen is cropped so that you see only the hero's head, shoulders, belt buckle and arms only up to the wrists because the baddie he or she is fighting is completely out of the frame. When you see the credits and see the leagues and leagues of artists who worked on this thing that were sacrificed on the pyre where they burned the steadicam or the glidecam and an editor that needs to cut from one place to another every two seconds and needed a strong sedative, you will long for a Spielberg, a Ridley Scott, a John Ford or a Hitchcock who knew how to frame things and didn't let the camera and editors run wild."
792,"I felt it the same theme as old movies, May be it is because I am not a hardcore fan of Avengers. Just can watch for time pass."
793,"The length of the movie increased with long talks, which makes almost no contribution to the plot or highlight heroes characters. Instead of Marvel usual excitement feeling (although I am not big fan of comics) you get the feeling was it worth to spend 3h.
If the movie would be brutally cut to 1.5 it would be good end product by Marvel."
794,"Comedic, emotional, action packed...... this movie was honestly fun to watch, but for a movie that was supposed to give closure to the many build up movies preceding it, it was ultimately disappointing.there are many flaws to the movie, but the greatest two in my opinion was Thanos and Captain Marvel.starting with captain marvel i think she was a mistake to the franchise. first she is ridiculously powerful, the problem with this is that in endgame they had to nerf and buff her across the movie, for example she is able to completely run through space ships but is not able to beat thanos. Also her strength kind of under-means the importance of the rest of the avengers.As for thanos, he had amazing character build up and development in infinity war, yet they completely ruined his character in end game. Not only did they chuck out modern thanos out of the window and went with a time travel plot, but they also made the past thanos more irrationally more evil and rash, for example he feels no sense of urgency to attack the avengers initially despite the fact that they hold the infinity stones.Fun movie but disappointing"
795,"If you kept away from spoilers and you purchased your ticketto go see the long waited Endgame...well, you will might end up after 3 hours of watching it, just like me, dissapointed. I know I was! What a mess !
Of course it is intended to patch screenplay holes up, or cut ties with actors that are no longer part of the franchise... But , I mean, come on!
Some of the make-up effects are just terrible, and yeah it is a very important Avenger with a very disturbing beard and wig to begin with!
Plot, caracter developement, lines, ughh...my expectations dissapeared, you know, snap of fingers!
3 stars given for the few laughs here and there , my favorite characters and 1 epic battle !"
796,Expected more much more as a fan I have continue sly fallowed the franchise wanted a better way of story telling much better story line it felt like every world from different song in a same album glued together in the worst way possible
797,"How come so many people love this movie ? It was extremely boring, it was difficult to stay awake for three hours"
798,So disappointing. The first hour was a complete snooze-fest and what they did to Thor and the Hulk were sickening. Lots of plot holes. The girl power stuff at the end was cringeworthy. Did this movie even have the same writers and Director as Infinity War??SPOILER ALERT:Hawkeye as a badass assassin was ridiculous and Gwyneth Paltrow in IM armor made me throw up in my mouth a little

800,"I just got back from seeng this on the big screen; first time to a movie house in 40 years.I will start by saying I do like Marvel and their superheroes...that being said, I felt Infinity Wars was too fast paced and lacked a coherent storyline. With all the hype for Endgame I was expecting a similar fast pace...only to be amazed at how boring the first half of the movie was. YES kiddies, a full hour and a half was literally 'snoozy time' when it comes to any story at all. To tell the truth, at one point about an hour into this I was thinking I was supposed to be thinking up excuses for why there was nothing of substance going on...For the entire three hour time frame, there could not have been more than 15% total with action of any amount in scenes; and that felt more like it was thrown in as an apology...frankly, I expected more; much much more than was delivered...at least all the characters who disappeared in Infinity Wars came back in Endgame...The short opinion...Huge Disappointment!"
801,"Completely wasting for time and money, I expect this movie will be the best Marvel's movie but it was the worst."
802,"I can only conclude that Disney are using bots to post 10 star ratings for this film.
Infinity War is better in every conceivable way.
I have to confess that after infinity war I had no idea how they could possibly top that.... it was going to take some great writing to turn the events of IW and create a movie that was better again.......I didn't happen.
I can't emphasize how bad I thought the story was.
It feels like a desperate attempt to conclude this saga early so they can start on the next wave.
1. You can't introduce a character as powerful as captain marvel into a fist fight.
2. Never ever ever use time travel in any movie... unless it's a comedy like bttf or hot tub.
3. Don't create scenes that make no sense just to appease the woman's movement in Hollywood...cheapInfinity war deserved so much more than this.Do yourself a favour and finish your saga with infinity war and forget this mess of a movie ever existed."
803,"The writers went to far with this one.Somethings wrong with today's society,for ppl to even consider this garbage as one of the greatest films ever made with an of 8.5 is a disgrace.8.5?????seriously,this film is an abomination to marvel fans and the entire human race,there was no love and passion done with this it was only for money.I hate this film and I especially hate the writers who did this,this couldve been the greatest of the greats."
804,"Fist I would like to say I don't generally love superhero movies. And I'm not really I big MCU fan and stuff like that.All that being said this was not a good movie.
It felt very predictable and formulaic the it was just like every other superhero film I've watched except a few with a few different villains. I thought they made the Hulk character really stupid. The he's not interesting if he doesn't get mad that's what makes the character interesting. Also the whole time travel thing didn't make any sense and just felt like other scenes and different movies.Then there were so many plot holes. Like isn't the timeline now all messed up? If you like action It's average. If you like story it's pretty bad. If you want something original you've come to the wrong place."
805,Standard story with happy end with a lot of tearful and stupid dialogs. A battle till about 10-15 mins from 3 hours.
806,"I was recently introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe by my wife, who is a long time fan of superhero film and TV. Apart from the occasional Batman movie, superheroes never really interested me, but I am now a convert.
Taking the MCU in the context in which it is intended, as fun and family orientated entertainment, you can allow yourself to become immersed in its brilliance.
Endgame ties up the Avengers franchise perfectly, with three hours of excellent action and character interaction.
The movies starts with Deadeye/Clint Barton losing his entire family. A story line taken from the characters origin story. It is a very emotional piece of cinematography to start the movie and creates a human connection with Deadeye (played by Jeremy Renner) in his pain and eventual mission to bring his family back. Thanos is dispatched early in the film with a swift strike of Thor's axe-hammer. The movie then delves into a series of time travel events to try and undo the devastation Thanos brought to planet Earth. Of course, surprise surprise, our heroes are successful, after an incredible final battle which involves every hero of the MCU coming together. It is a wonderful sight to behold. But alas, what has been foreshadowed throughout the franchise, finally came to pass. The passing of Tony Stark. A sad moment for all Iron Man and Avengers fans, for sure. An epic money spinner? Yes of course. But nobody can deny it's value for money to entertainment ratio. Possibly the greatest super hero movie ever made and it will take something truly special to take that crown."
807,"Its perfection. ""I knew it !"" Its the best MCEU movie till date."
808,I just want to say how amazing this film is from start to finish. This will take you on a emotional ride.You will not he disappointed
809,"I just love this movie. Specially the climax, seriously one of the best climax I have ever seen."
810,"LITERALLY , one of the best movies i have seen in my entire life , filled with a tone of action and emotions . you will love avenger endgame . ' i love you 3000 '"
811,"First Time i saw the movie in 3D. It was a great experience for me. It's awesome movie.
I'm a big fan of MCU."
812,"While I see the D.C. whiner babies reviews on here... this is an excellent, intelligent conclusion. How many would react in such a disaster as befell our heroes in the previous chapter. Almost all questions answered. Some still linger.Spoiler: what about Vision...would the reset not reset him?
A almost perfect sendoff to this phase of films...
Watch for yourself and enjoy. Just remember, it's a comic book movie.
Final Hangmen count. 11 give it a 9/10... 1 gives it a 7/10...1 abstains"
813,The best movie of marvell universe I only can say it's awesome
814,"Avengers: Endgame brilliantly brings our heroes back again for a movie that fans all over the world were waiting for after the events of Avengers: Infinity War. After waiting for this movie to come to cinemas for a year I am happy to say that Endgame kept me on the edge of my seat from the get go. From beginning, middle and end I was always waiting for the next moment to occur with anxious breathing and nervous sweating because I truly wanted the heroes I have grown up watching to make it out alive. This movie is almost perfect and if you have not seen this movie yet or haven't seen the rest of the Marvel series yet (some how)! Then you must watch this movie A.S.A.P when you have time because movies like this are a once in a lifetime opportunity to see and it would be horrible if you missed out. So, grab your favourite drink and get ready for 3 hours of nail biting, nervous sweating fun!"
815,"After eleven years and twenty-one movies, the Endgame is finally here and I must say it's everything it should be. With a massive runtime of three hours, ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019) rarely feels like it wastes a second. In regards to its runtime, each hour of the movie does have its own sort of beginning, middle, and end along with its own themes. The first hour of the movie really hits hard as a sort of drama hot off the events of ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018) and I could see how it might be a tad boring if you didn't watch all the previous movies leading up to this one, but for those of you that did it's amazing to watch our heroes fighting a battle that they can't suit up for. Things truly get interesting however in the second hour of the movie, which plays off as more of a thriller reminiscent of ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014). There are some great action sequences here, but most of the excitement comes from the high stakes, suspense, and a happy serving of fan service. Last but not least, the final act of the movie. The last hour of ""Endgame"" is everything you could ever want for the epic conclusion of this franchise. Superb action scenes, inspiring moments, and some of the best character exchanges you could ever hope to see.
From beginning to end, you can tell the people at Marvel Studios really gave it their all on this one. Robert Downey Jr continues and surpasses expectations with Iron Man, whose arc in this movie hits home on so many levels. Chris Evans, on the other hand, takes the spotlight in this movie with his Captain America, once again we get to see his symbol of all that is good try to find hope in the aftermath of a devastating loss. It should also be noted that while Iron Man and Captain America both have incredible arcs throughout the movie, it is possible Thor that has the best arc of the entire MCU both in and out of universe. Watching as his character learns what it means to be worthy in the first Thor, only to be faced with loss and failure in every movie he's appeared in after might seem harsh but Chris Hemsworth does a terrific job balancing the humor that Taika Waititi added to the character along with the pain that he has experienced. Of course, all of this was possible thanks to the excellent directing of Anthony and Joseph Russo and the oversight of Marvel's very own Kevin Feige who is a Stan Lee for the modern era.
As you might be able to tell I found the movie does have a ton of pro's, but that's because it was everything that I could ever hope for after following this franchise since I was nine years old going to see the first ""Iron Man"" (2008) with my dad and brothers. With that said though, like all movies this one does have flaws and most of them just come from the fact that this movie serves more of a love letter to fans than a film shooting for an oscar nomination. While the heroes truly do thrive in this one, Thanos does take a slight step back and in my opinion, caused him to be a slightly less compelling villain when compared to his portrayal in the previous movie. He does, however, get his fair share of amazing scenes, I just didn't find I was as connected to the big bad as I once was. The film's biggest flaw might be the amount of fan service in it. While it's great watching it, and caused me and the rest of my theater to cheer and clap till our hands bruised during the premier, sometimes it felt a little redundant or hung around too long. One such scene happens in the third act of the movie without going into too many details to avoid spoilers, during the final battle there's a massive tease towards the future of the MCU as a certain group of heroes band together. It's an awesome scene and I really look forward to seeing how it pays off, but thanks to the dialogue it comes off as forced and cheesy. It's meant to invoke similar emotions to ""Avengers"" (2012) when we see the heroes band together for the first time in New York, but fails to recognize that that scene was great due to the age-old rule of ""show, don't tell.""
All that said, be sure to check the movie out as soon as possible. It's definitely meant to be seen on a large screen with loud surround sound speakers, but be aware you might not enjoy it as much if you haven't seen all the other movies. Overall I would give it an 8.5/10 and a ranking of Marvelous."
816,Fell asleep during the first hour. Too much talking. Realized this movie was for the new generation. Nick Fury finally makes an appearance during the last five minutes of the movie. Three hours of my life I can never get back. Gag me with a Smurf!
817,"SPOILERS Ahead!!! Turn back now!!Endgame brings MORE plot holes and nonsense. How can this be??Part One of the Avengers movie (Infinity War) oozed into theaters in Spring of 2018. It was not what I expected and I was pretty vocal in my dislike of the film. I stand by that review.Spring of 2019 brought us Part Two (Endgame). I motored over to my local multiplex and plopped down to watch and be amazed. As I sat munching my popcorn before the feature I kept thinking. ""It's going to be okay. It's really going to be okay. It can't be as bad as the first film. It's going to be okay.""It was NOT okay.How is it possible that this film is even worse than Part One? That should not be possible, right? But it is. I'll attribute most of the 'bad' to the fact that the movies were shot simultaneously. For some reason the whole Betty Botter tongue twister is rattling around in my head. I suppose because the Russos needed some better butter to make their bitter batter better. Evidently, they couldn't find any.Because the 'batter' is bitter y'all!So many things went wrong here. Let's start at the beginning. We spend the first hour of this snooze fest in a never ending loop of 'where's waldo' to catch up on some of the folk that are left after Thanos snapped his fingers and killed off half of life in the universe in Infinity War. Stark is floating in space with Nebula running out of oxygen and food. Everyone is depressed. Thor is super depressed. Enter Captain Marvel who brings Stark and Nebula to earth. Does she stay to help? Nope. She flies off to help other planets that don't have an 'avengers'. Whoa, wait...I thought she was supposed to save the day, trounce Thanos. I thought this would be her moment. No? We have to save the world and find Thanos on our own? Huh! The team decides to find Thanos, take back the stones and reverse the first snapping. Thor whacks off Thanos' head when they learn Thanos destroyed the stones and there will be no do over.The snooze fest continues 'Five Years Later'.Ant Man escapes the quantum realm (plot hole...cos how did he do that, exactly?) He finds Black Widow and Captain America and explains that he's only been gone 5 hours 'cause 'time moves differently in the quantum realm.' (say what?) Captain America is leading a 'touchy feely' grief counseling encounter group with one of the directors (Joe Russo) providing a cameo as a grieving spouse. This was our gay moment that we were promised and it almost slips by unnoticed.Moving on.The group approaches Stark to do the time travel reset. He initially blows them off because he has a life and a kid. However, he puts all that to the side because of the loss of Peter Parker. We gotta have Spiderman back because his next movie is in the pipeline. Bruce Banner and the Hulk have found the peace Jekyll and Hyde never did and are happily signing autographs, taking selfies and blissfully not remembering that Hulk wussed out in Infintity War because Thanos kicked his green butt. Thor is living in New Asgard in squalor with his buddies Korg and Miek, drinking copious amounts of alcohol, porking up on snacks and developing a substantial beer belly. Hawkeye has turned into a vigilante and is systematically wiping out bad guys to avenge his family and improve the world. Yeah, whatever works.The whole 'stone heist' segment of the film was like a bad version of any of the Ocean's movies except all the bad that went on was not thought out ahead or planned. In fact, the movie jokes about the improbability of time travel by referencing a ton of movies (from Back to the Future to Star Trek) and saying 'that's not the way it works'. One problem...they never really explain how time travel 'really' works because nothing in the whole process was consistent. Do you or don't you interact with your former self? Maybe, maybe not. Will all be returned to its 'pre Thanos' snapped' glory? Not really. Will all our favorites come back to life? Ehhh...not quite (Loki and Vision are not brought back and I'm STILL upset about that!) Will what you do in the past change your timeline? Depends on what you want to do? What happens if you decide to stay in the past or your past self comes to the future? Why quibble over minutiae? Plot hole after plot hole opens up and we're supposed to just swallow the blue pill and believe whatever we're told...however cockeyed that may be.Captain Marvel does come back to take out Thanos' ship and join with the other women (in a heavy handed obligatory feminist moment that is so contrived) to do battle with Thanos and keep him away from the glove. I had hoped that this would be Captain Marvel's moment. I thought she would put on the glove, snap her fingers and we'd all go back to business as usual. But no. She makes no attempt to put the glove on herself. Really?? Tony Stark uses his tech to transfer the stones from Thanos' glove to his, snap his fingers, and turn Thanos and all his minions to dust. But...but...we had been lead to believe that Captain Marvel was the pinnacle of super heroes. Guess Captain Marvel didn't get that memo. So why did we even need a Captain Marvel origin story? We could have had a Black Widow origin story. We were already invested in her character. Plus Scarlett is a better actress than Brie. She just is.What is so frustrating is none of this is a surprise. Not one thing. We know that Steve is going to stay with Peggy. We know that Black Widow is going to sacrifice herself for the Soul Stone. We know the effects of the first snapping will be successfully reversed. The Russos telegraph every single plot point (and I use the word 'plot' loosely because there wasn't one). The dialog was so basic that I found myself speaking it before the characters did. I hate when that happens because it's never a good sign in a first-run film that I've never seen and which I did not Google or read a single review.This film was a monumental waste of time. I waited ten years for this. I waited TEN years for THIS??
I rated the movie a '3' because I got to see some old favs. I was glad to see Rene Russo as Frigga. Loki, of course and the Strike Team leader Rumlow.I'm sure this movie will make a ton of money. Most Marvel films do. I usually see each of the films in theaters more than once. Not this time. I'm done. I will not give any more of my hard earned cash to this effort. Not one penny more. Neither should you."
818,"Well. Went to see it opening night and came out so disappointed. Was reading reviews when going in (without the spoilers) that were so great only to be hugely disappointed!!! No spoilers in this review as none are really necessary. To much time on empty characters (Hawkeye), way to long to bring back the half that are gone so most of the movie was wasted with slow plots that will be destroyed in the end. The captain ending is stupid. How many holes are there now!!! And boring hulk!!!! Why???? Infinity war was on a different level and this just fell off from the beginning. I felt like when I watched the NEW Star Wars movies. Total waste and let down. I think they forgot what got them this far and just caved to making the almighty dollar in the end."
819,"Last avengers movie like we knew it. And the everlasting boring one, trying the mange some drama that Neve happened??? Bad jokes... Time travel??? Really? Captain America picks Thor's hammer?
What happened to this movie??? Storyline mediocre... Disappointed and waste of time. 3 hours wasted."
820,"This movie is a steaming pile of overrated feces.Bad ending , badly written lines.The best thing about this movie is that it kills of that annoying Black Widow."
821,"Avengers Endgame is a perfect culmination of the 11 years of build up and 21 movies. In this movie they showcases us on how our main heroes dealt with the traumatizing event of Infinity War and how the cope and dealt this situation. I never ever cry in movies but my god, this one almost did. I won't give away anything, but the ending of 2 characters in this movie made me cry and put a smile on my face because of how right and perfect it is. This is by no means a perfect movie but it is a perfect ending. I gave it 10 Stars because of how I resonate with this film and how it ends the Marvel Cinematic Universe so perfectly."
822,"Years of sorry telling coming together at a close. The effects, cinematography, acting, all very good and fully satisfying. Not a cash grab like lots of people are saying. After watching a few times, the plots holes are null. You just have to pay attention. Plus, Cap finally gets his dance after the heart wrenching scene in the first CA, where Peggy loses contact. Iron Man sacrificing himself is the ultimate and brave conclusion to his entire story and character, the ultimate growth of a character. Sadly, this movie can't convey the story without a lot of analyzing and supporting stories from other films. Otherwise, you'll see all these plot holes. Watch it and the other MCU films. Phenomenal storyline, possibly of our time."
823,"That was the fantastic , amazing movie of their time"
824,"11 years, and still going strong, MARVEL and Disney were very much banking on audiences reacting well to to the big and very expensive climax to the Infinity Saga. And since this film became extremely close to toppling Avatar as the highest grossing film of all time, I think it's safe to say that Avengers: Endgame did so and much more.With over half the cast brutally turned to ash at the end of the equally incredible Infinity War, writers, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely did a superb job of wrapping up the loose ends left by Infinity War, while also wrapped up many open ended points from many other aspects of the past 22 movies. While many studios continue to try and often fail at an extensive movie universe, MARVEL has very rarely fumbled in this monstrous achievement. Despite a couple of duds, (looking at you, Incredible Hulk and Thor 2) the MCU has gone down with universal praise from fans, critics and general audiences goers alike.Nevertheless, while it's very easy to proclaim Endgame as being perfect upon first viewing, (I was admittedly guilty of that) it does have a couple of problems that can hold it back. The biggest being the inconsistent and had to understand concept of time travel. Markus and McFeely seemingly have a juxtaposing explanation compared to that of directors, Joe and Anthony Russo. Personally, I've merged both explanations, which has made re-watching the film just as enjoyable as it was at the midnight release.Additionally, some moments can be questionable, in particular one big crowd pleasing moment between the female heroes, coming together to support Captain Marvel. (Brie Larson) Ultimately, there was clear evidence that Larson's character didn't need the support. And while the moment is brilliant to watch and definitely deserves the inevitable applause it receives, the moment would be even better had Captain Marvel not been the one needing support. A very good example of what I mean can be seen in the video below.But despite some small hiccups, the majority of this narrative holds up brilliantly, and still holds up as a sublime book end for that part of the MCU's history. And while technically, Jon Watt's Spider-Man: Far From Home is the final Phase 3 film, and is technically the last film in this saga, Endgame is the big book end for the majority of it's cast, and is a tremendous and emotional send off for many of our beloved heroes.As we've come to expect from MARVEL, the production values for Endgame are off the scale, with tremendous special effects, which blends in so many elements and characters, while still appearing cohesive and a beautiful spectacle. Cinematography by Trent Opaloch was beautifully frame, full of dazzling colours at the right moments, thankfully avoiding the drab and darkly lit cinematography seen in Captain Marvel earlier in the year. Additionally, with the time travelling aspect to the narrative, Opaloch's cinematography also pays respect to the work of MCU cinematographers from past installments. Since the film was shot entirely in IMAX alongside Infinity War, some may find the standard cinemascope version (the most common version shown) to feel boxed in at times, or not framed as well. And while this can be noticeable, it doesn't hinder the film much, since everything you need to see is perfectly visible, with the IMAX versions also bringing extra detail on a larger scale. It's films like this that deserve to be shown and seen on the big-screen.Throughout the MCU's run, many aspects have improved. And the biggest improvement Endgame demonstrates is the sublime music by legendary composer, Alan Silvestri. After years of bland and unimaginative music, Silvestri really gets to be creative with this tremendous collection of music. His use of Jazz during the heist adds a unique tone to those moments, and the many inclusions of his empowering Avengers theme keeps the excitement coming. If MARVEL keeps giving composers the freedom to embrace their creativity, I look forward to continue seeing more work like this.Obviously, after 11 years of story-telling, it's hard to please everyone with what you put out, and for those audience members that somehow haven't seen Endgame or any previous MCU installment, I do highly recommend taking the journey as many fans and general audiences have done. Start at the beginning, and follow the journey. Because after completing the entire Infinity Saga (including Far From Home) I can safely say that Endgame left me dazzled, shocked, but ultimately satisfied. And even with my minor problems, it's easy to look past, and just be entertained by this thrilling adventure. What else is there to say but... Avengers Assemble!SCORES

825,"This review contains spoilers for Avengers: Endgame and Infinity WarWe are in the endgame now...Is there anything left to say about a movie over two billion dollars and has been a bigger topic of conversation around the world than Game of Thrones and Donald Trump?Turns out, a lot.What's this movie about?Avengers: Endgame is following the devastating events of the Infinity War. The universe is in ruins. With the remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more in order to undo Thanos' actions and restore order to the universe.
The culmination of 10 years and 22 films. The most comprehensive mythological ever presented on the screen, an incredible range of world-class talent, and all the rest. This is the ""end of the road"" Tony started us on.MY OPINION:Story:
We never see our heroes like this in any other Marvel film. They know they lost and they know that they can't do anything to reverse what happened in Infinity War. As an audience, you really feel the emotion of loss of hope.Everybody is in a different location, Iron Man is trapped in space with Nebula while Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow, and other fellow Avengers are in the Avenger tower.First of all, I love this movie, but at the same time, like all the other movies in the Marvel Universe, it has the same flaws.
This is a 3-hour long movie and they made a great job balancing all the character and action moments. Phasing sometimes is a little off, but that's okay because it doesn't distance you out from the movie.
In the beginning, Captain Marvel saves Tony Stark in the first 10 minutes of the movie and that to me is just lazy writing. It was too fast and it doesn't give you the time to acknowledge that these characters are in real danger. Another issue that I have with this movie is that Ant-Man is saved by a rat. I don't know whose idea that was, but we had some theories of how Ant-Man could return from the quantum realm and is this really what they gave us? We're supposed to believe that Ant-Man is saved by a rat. I just don't buy this stuff in movies.Characters:Let's talk about characters since this movie is heavily about the story and character ark. Characters are always brilliantly written and balanced throughout the whole film. They took some risks with two characters which could have turned out pretty bad, but somehow they managed to find the perfect way to do it. Of course, I'm talking about Thor and Hulk ( Bruce Banner ). I loved both of the characters. What they have changed felt quite ambitious and hilarious, although I sometimes miss the old Hulk smashing things like the good old days.
This film is heavily focused on Iron Man ( Tony Stark ) and Captain America ( Steve Rogers ). What they have done with these two characters is just wonderful and brilliant. In the beginning, you feel the tension between these two characters because of what happened in the Civil War. One of Tony's iconic line this movie proposed was "" I love you 3000 "" which added this film something special. Considering how Hawkeye's relationship with his daughter was described, this line emphasized it all perfectly. Tony's sacrifice at the end when he took all the infinity stones and snapped his finger killing Thanos and his army was very well done. And Tony's final line "" I AM IRON MAN "" added another layer of emotion to that moment. His final line is a reference to the very first Iron Man film that created this huge universe. Marvel finds the perfect way to end Tony's ark and it couldn't be any better. His monologue at the end was so meaningful and precious. In the end, as an audience, you understand and admit that this is the end of the Iron Man storyline.Captain America's story arc didn't fall behind Iron Man's in any manner. In this movie, Marvel finds a perfect way to end Captain America's ark. In the beginning, he is hopeless like all the fellow Avengers. He adds this film so much heart and emotion. At the final battle, we saw Captain America hold the Mjollnir which was an awesome moment. We saw Captain America move Mjholiner a little bit in Avengers: Age of Ultron and it was even better to see Captain America finally lift and hold Mjollnir which proves that he is finally worthy. After Hulk snapped and got every hero back in action Captain America says "" AVENGERS ASSEMBLE "", this moment was something to be experienced. After the final battle, Captain America had to bring the stones back to fix different timelines. After that, we are seeing old Captain America which left us confused, but soon after that, we learn that after he puts the stones back to their original locations, he lived his full life with his only love Agent Carter. When he finally returns as an old man back to his timeline, he gives his shield to Falcon when everyone thought it was gonna be Bucky, but I thought it was a great moment between Captain America and Falcon. The movie ends with Captain America and Agent Carter dancing in the past which was a reference to the first Captain America film similar to the reference mentioned about Iron Man earlier. It was a great ending for Captain America's character ark. It couldn't end any better. It was a wonderful and bittersweet ending.Time Travel:Now it's the time for the main concept that everyone is talking about, which is time travel.
This is not an ordinary time travel film like Back to the Future. At the beginning of this film, we find out that Thanos used the stones again on another planet. Our heroes are once more going to try to get the stones from Thanos, but when they arrive they are learning that Thanos used the stones to destroy the stones. Then the film cuts to five years later...
Our heroes are desperate and try to move on some do, but not them. All of a sudden Ant-Man appears and talks about the possibilities of time travel. After Tony changes his decision and joins the team again for the possibilities of time travel. After they find out how time travel works they are going back in time and the movie turns into a time heist.Time travel is a risky thing to do in any movie because it has science behind it and if you change the rules of time travel people will judge every little thing, in the end, it could be a bad choice for your film. In this film, they change the rules and not everything makes sense, but after they explained how it works in this universe it started to makes more sense. This is a superhero movie after all not everything will going to make sense and that's okay. After they went back on time the movie shines and we as an audience are experiencing the old MCU films once again which was an awesome moment to experience in the theater. Our heroes are traveling different timelines through MCU the reason is they are trying to restore the stones before Thanos for the sake of the universe. Hawkeye and Natasha went to Vormir to get the soul stone, but they didn't know the requirements for the soul stone. Then we as audience witnessing the terrible event that happened to Natasha aka Black Widdow. She sacrifices herself for the soul stone which was a shocking moment that I didn't see coming. After all, this is a fun, ambitious, different and emotional time heist superhero film.CONCLUSION:In the end, this is a brilliantly written, well-directed and well-acted action-packed superhero film that fans were waiting for. Sometimes passing is little off and there are some lazy moments and not all the time travel stuff makes sense, but as a whole, it just works and creates a whole different superhero experience for the audience. I love this movie and every superhero fan will enjoy this movie. This is the end of the journey Tony had started us on and it ended beautifully.Rating: 9/10"
826,"Exhilarating, breathtaking culmination to the Infinity Saga delivers in every way."
827,"I've read way too many negative reviews on here of this film so one must restore some balance. Firstly the issues. It's too long and it does not have the pace of infinity so the first hour is a struggle. I didn't agree with what they did with Thor and inevitably one or two characters are under used, Thanos, Thor, spider man. Yes, it is over sentimental but it is the finale sooo... Romanoff's death was not mourned as iron mans was which is a shame. Right, now the good bits. The fight scenes are epic particularly the last battle. Iron Man is outstanding and the star of the show in my opinion. I loved the hulk/banner cross over character and as usual the humor is solid. As finales go what more could you ask? It has an 'end'. A perfect finish to this phase. And the time machine plot is very good and they arc the previous films in beautifully. All in all this is a great ending to what has been an extraordinary anthology. Shout out to Scott Lang btw who is brilliant! Watch don't read. I AM IRON MAN 😓"
828,Very sad that the series is over but overall the marvel studios did a great job in keeping it alive and building a fan base of Avengers. it was the most anticipated movie. and lived up to the expectations. The story was a bit too much than the action. but overall it was ok..
829,No post credit seen. Thats why i rate only 9. Rest is amazing. I love the way of writing of film.
830,"I still remember when I first saw Iron Man back in elementary school. Later, I was invited by a good friend of mine to see Winter Soldier in theaters. Since then, I've watched almost every single MCU film in theaters, and my favorites (Iron Man, Ultron, Guardians) have been subject to many re-watches. My sister and I often hang out by going to see the latest Marvel flick, and it's become somewhat of a tradition for me. In two months, I'll be going off to college, and an era in my life, one in which Marvel has played an enormous role, will come to an end.Ultimately, that's why this movie matters so much to me. Yes, an era of film is over, but so is one of my eras. It represents that, and the respect it pays to all of the characters I've grown up with is unlike anything. Until I watched this film, I'd never cried during a super hero film. Now I have.If this movie was simply a good conclusion to Infinity War, I would've respected it. But it's so much more than that, and that's why I love it. When I gazed upon the shot of Cap standing by himself against Thanos' army, I thought ""This is Captain America."" When Iron Man was willing to sacrifice everything to do what he knew was right, killing himself in the process, I thought ""This is Iron Man."" If you're a Marvel fan, you'll never see anything quite like this film. Infinity War was a masterpiece. Endgame will be a legend."
831,"The final showdown begins in Marvels biggest blockbuster ever! Avengers: Endgame! With a gigantic cast and the Russo's working hard out behind the scenes, can all their vision and determination meet expectations? And also reader beware, you're in for plenty of spoiler scares. If you've not seen the movie yet, don't read this.Plot
Five years after Infinity War, The entire universe lies in turmoil after the events of The Decimation caused by Thanos the Mad Titan. Moving on from their grief, the surviving Avengers led by Captain America and Black Widow assemble for a final time in one last ditch effort to undo the damage left by Thanos.Likes
Avengers: Endgame is a darker, action fuelled, emotional story of a world now devoid of any hope. The Avengers themselves are no better as they are also broken to the core and struggling very hard to move on from their grief. Literally, it is a heartfelt theme that even has us audiences downhearted also with these losses of life.The plot itself is vastly well-written that you can feel a strong connection to it and all of the characters involved. The time travel plot is a nice new direction for the story to go into as well. And not too familiar or clichéd to other movie plots that use the theme.
The stakes are much higher than they were before and the risks are more daring. And every scene and dialogue is just astonishingly well written in. There are plenty of new awesome character interactions just like last time but ultimately better than ever. For example Tony and Nebula bonding together while trying to survive in outer space, Rocket teasing Captain Marvel for her new Hairdo, Hulk negotiating with The Ancient One and Tony getting to talk with his father for one last time. All while packing in plenty of outrageous moments of humour and levity to keep the pace. My favourite funny moments were mainly with Ant-Man doing stuff like attempting time travel and when a spaceship kept killing his burritos!The action and visuals are incredibly filmed and offer a ton of thrills and awe to the mix. Every scene is like a comic book panel coming alive before your very eyes and the action flows clearly leaving an exciting impact on the viewer.
Since there's so many characters that appear in this movie, I'm only going to narrow it to the main cast members.Chris Evans gives us ultimately the best performance with Captain America yet. And continues to show no fault in developing his character. I also loved how he got to pick up Thors hammer in the end and face-off against Thanos with it. Oh and that final Scene where he goes back in time to have that dance with Peggy unlike before in The First Avenger.Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man continues to be the Playboy genius we know and love. And now an aspiring Daddy too. I felt touched at how he got to meet his father one last time and just give him one last hug. Even if his dad never got to know it was him. But still, very touching.Hulk played by Mark Raffalo brings about new and funny Hulk humour and even managed to cure the Hulk within him too. Now he basically is Doctor Hulk! His new persona does remind me a lot of Beast from the X-Men as well.
Well.... Chris Hemsworth's new Thor look did stagger me very much. Where five years later he became a fat and lazy bum who watches his best mates Korg and Meek playing videogames for the rest of his days. But I did find this amusing because you'd expect that Thor is this all-mighty deity with no faults and regrets of his own. And seeing Hemsworth and the directors push Thor to this edge is a great way to see how he is able to overcome these new obstacles. But, for God's sake Thor, please loose that belly in Guardians 3!Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow was also a fantastic final performance for the young actress. I was probably more heartbroken for her most when she died in the movie. Though yes, Black Widow is supposed to be a hardened killer, but deep down she was the full heart and soul of the Avengers and seeing her sacrifice herself instead of Hawkeye does get quite depressing because she was a very likable character to me. And also seeing Black Widow not having a family but the Avengers was what makes it worse because she'll never get to have that chance again. It's just so sad...(Sniff) anyway getting off the crocodile tears. And finally the villain himself. Thanos. Josh Brolin continues to bring out a menacing villain who won't rest until balance in the Universe is truly achieved. And actually now that I think about it all, he is much more dangerous than last time and even came close to winning again a second time! Another spoiler sorry! Though I will miss John Brolins portrayal of the character after this, but who knows what the future MCU instalments will bring.Honestly, all of the cast is good, from Ant-Man, to Captain Marvel, To Rocket, To War Machine, To Nebula, the supporting and minor cast members. Even the ones that returned from the dead in the final battle are all so good.
Nearly everything in Avengers Endgame is just so fantastic you could just almost call this one completely flawless for a superhero movie. But oh no, we're forgetting one thing though. The flaws themselves... Read on...Dislikes
So the dislikes are nearly the same as Infinity War, its predecessor. So let's just go to my biggest offenders.The running time is still a problem for me like most of the other MCU movies. At a whopping 185 minutes this is enough to rival the run time of Return of the King. And it can get tiring most times when a few scenes drag on for a long time with too much exposition being its main cause. But, what the hell should've I expected, this is the Avengers finale. Of course it needs to be long! Still with the amount of likes above, the time does seem to fly by quite quickly for the most part. But I'm saying, 3 hours is pushing it for me.Unlike infinity War the character perspectives are far more improved but still this film continues to be TOO crowded. Especially in the final act. SPOILER WARNING when many of the characters are resurrected and gather to the Avengers Facility to battle Thanos, it became SUPER crowded all of a sudden. Though like I said it did handle how it executed the use of them in the final battle. Working together in groups and all like a footfall pitch. But still, it feels a bit jarring trying to keep a direct focus on where the true perspective lies.And also, Korg plays Fortnite in this movie. By 2023 (As the rest of the film is set 5 years later) I already imagine the game would be extremely outdated by then and many people may have already moved onto other Battle Royal games or other trends. So, yep, very pointless product placement.Verdict?
Not since Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings has a film series left such a large impact on the world. With a record-breaking gross of over a billion in its first opening weekend, The Russo brothers deliver you the spectacular finale to this Avenging Saga that we all wished for! With plenty of Story, action, suspense and emotion to sink your teeth into, Avengers Endgame is by far the best finale to a Superhero film series ever! But will the MCU be able to achieve so much more after? We have yet to be sure. But whether it be the New Avengers, The X-Men, The Fantastic Four, The Guardians of the Galaxy or X-Force that steps up to fill in their shoes against the next big bad, you can be sure that none of them will ever have a finale as epic as this one!
Avengers Endgame receives 9½/10!"
832,"Really?!?! 3 hours full of nothing? Storylines which took too long. Before all the parts came together, I almost walked out of the theater. Spend your money on a different film"
833,"1. Hulk absent once again. I don't remember the Mark Ruffolo comics. Haven't seen the Hulk since Thor: Ragnarok
2. Movie could've cut out 40minutes of irrelevant trash. Save it for an extended release dvd.
3. Thanos has zero stones, and the Avengers (with the addition to Captain Marvel !!!) have less success against him. Would love an explanation behind this logic.
4. I personally thought Captain America quitting aka retiring was extremely dumb. The guy who never gives up on his optimism and moving forward just throws all of that aside.
5. The Soul Stone scene was far too played out. It was embarrassingly long. Overdid the ""who will end up dying"" even though it's 100% obvious! I mean, why would the movie open on Clint and his family for nothing? Wouldn't be surprised if this scene caused people to walk out of the theater.
6. I would have loved to see Captain Marvel have a significant role in this movie. Instead we got more Tilda Swindon screen time than Captain Marvel. Unforgivable.Overall, infinity war had positioned endgame to be something unforgettable and a true gem. I think this film failed to accomplish that in almost every aspect possible. Huge let down."
834,Problem with time travel is if your not careful you make the whole plot impossible to believe. End game doesn't even come close to tieing up its loose ends. The remaining avengers act selfishly and arragently to the point you want them to fail.Thanos did nothing wrong. I hated this film.
835,"Watched this effort and was disappointed. In fact, the last three efforts from the writers and directors of Winter Soldier have been sorely lacking. Where is the superb action in these films? The entire fights on the ship, highway, and elevator in Winter Soldier were not only intense, but they were exciting to watch since it showed the great skills of both Cap A and Black Widow. It also showed them winning. In Infinity and Endgame many fights were depressing, except the short fight in Endgame. Winter soldier also had a great story, where many difficult situations were sorted or calculated by Cap A and Black Widow being skillful fighters and brilliant strategists. In Endgame, the creative and brilliant science prodigy Iron man looked inadequate. The writers could have had him, together with Nebula, thinking creatively to get back to Earth using the Milano instead of cheating the storyline by having Cap. Marvel suddenly appearing. What about Antman? The film had a rat conveniently pressing the right controls to have Scott Lang fart out of the van. Wow, what a plot convenience!. Surely, Scott could think of something in five hours to get out of the time vortex. Another superhero made to look inadequate. Let's get to Hulk and the tragic storyline of the God hero Thor. The former had no chance to avenge his defeat directly at the hands of Thanos. Surely, the immense strength of Hulk together with the brains of Banner could figure something out. And Hulk's reaction to Black widow's death was pitiful. He did not even get angry and tip over the edge. Come on, what is that? Boy, after the heroic turn of Thor in Infinity War, here he is reduced to a fat God that cannot even defeat a Gauntlet-less Thanos with the Stormbreaker and Mjolnir. I feel bad for the brilliant Hemsworth, who had a great turn in Dark World (went to his post-Avengers Loki for help with defeating the Elf. This was brilliant storytelling) and Ragnarok. The writers had him lose twice to Thanos. Where is the satisfaction in that! Where was the satisfaction of both Scarlett Witch or Nebula not having Thanos suffer greatly for him killing Vision or abusing the latter for many years, respectively. The storyline should have been better constructed. Cap A could have had a better fight with Thanos. He is a master strategist and fighting soldier. Couldn't the writers have had him training for Thanos in the last 5-6 yrs. Improving his strength and getting to know everything about Thanos. Couldn't they have had him helping the weak through fighting the bad guys in the meantime, like Hawkeye. Hawkeye's story was good, as the film resembled Signs to s small extent in concentrating on a small family situation and why it was necessary for him to reverse the snap. The last three films have been rushed. In Civil War, everything was supposed to be ok after Cap writes a letter to Iron man. Come on. Take time to write a great story that these films deserve. To have all the heroes return in the last 15 mins is pathetic. These heroes deserved more time. Gosh, Okoye's fighting skills were not even displayed as well as they were in Black Panther. The hype far exceeds the fun factor in this movie and the past two. Not been satisfied with Marvel since WS. Have not bothered to watch Antman 2 or Captain Marvel. This was bad."
836,"I thought i was gonna watch the biggest movie of all time but i watched 1 rating piece of crap of movie, coz i had to rewatch previous movies of mcu, repeated scenes of this stupid movie and also did i mention a back to the future version but outer space kinda movie.
One reason i watch movies is to get entertained and humor/jokes like rocket talking to stark and the other funny dialogues btw did they budget cutting or something coz we all know the movie was gonna make more money than disney even have instead they preferred people going to the future and change stuff from before. And one more thing why kill the two biggest mcu money makers?"
837,"Infinity wars was really good and I was looking forward to see the continuation (end games), I went very excited to the movies to watch this movie and I was completely disappointed.
First of all why the corny comedy? Why destroying the reputation of the heroes, Thor is now an out of shape dirty alcoholic and the Hulk is now a hybrid Sissy who is scared to fight, he is not what he used to be, he is just a pathetic corny character.
Most of the movie is just Blah, Blah, Blah, ridiculous time travel and corny all the way.
I used to love Marvel movies, but after this transformation to corny comedy I don't think I will want to see another Marvel movie.
Stan Lee must be really disappointed in heaven or wherever he is.
They killed the franchise, it is character defamation, if I was Thor or the Hulk I would sue the director of this movie."
838,"Worst Marvel Movie ever!
The screen is mostly crowded with people who are adding no character or value to the scenes.
Waste of Thor and Hulk. Ironman is gone.
Marvel is going to struggle without these guys who were responsible for all the success they've had. Poor decision making and it's going to cost them heavy!!!"
839,"Can't ignore the truth that this is a super hero film! While except the last several minute, other plots can attract any attention. Can't even compare with Avengers: Infinity War! Narrative thread and music disordered throughout 3-hour movie."
840,"I really couldn't understand the plot and for me it was a watch once only.I enjoyed solo movies 🎥 like
Iron Man
Ant Man
Spiderman
Thor
Dr Strange etcToo many cooks spoil the broth!Advice : Go and watch SHAZAM for a better movie experience and a good laugh 😀Enjoy the Bank Holiday!Karim Sumar"
841,"Please give me back the 3 hours spent in the theater to see this.All plot is overall stupid, it's like sooooooo long... and stretched..To much hype for.. nothing actually."
842,"3 hours about nothing.
Only one reason why this movie has too large box office is hyping."
843,"Indulgent rubbish. Do yourself a favor and just watch infinity war because this film is boring and by the end, I just did not care anymore!"
844,"I really loved movie , but if the actors change i won't follow such as many other serials who left behind and doesn't worth to follow. specially Robert and Chris, I've spent hours and made connection and don't wanna make such a thing again."
845,"Epic
historic
beautiful
BIG
Marvel Celebrates Film Journey Reaffirming All American Superhero Myth"
846,THE best movie series ever! So touching at the end but full of action during whole time. End of a great story!
847,Meh...could have made better use of the superheroes
848,"Just try to imagine someone who didn't watch the 22 previous Avengers movies, watching this movie.It's just totally incomprehensible.And even for someone (like me) who watched the previous movies, how can I remember all the details after 11 years ?Too many characters and too much talkings, this movie is BORING ! A pile of private jokes doesn't make a good movie.I give 3 stars for the last 20 minutes. Just for the SFX, but I don't understand who fighting who and why."
849,"Cheesy humor, extremely overrated,
And not enough Thanos ;)Way to many jokes destroying tension and suspense...First hour and a half should have lasted 40 minutes.Thanos is by far the best character in the movie, who barely got any screen time. Why not give the ""villain"" some actual screen time?Thanos isn't even a bad guy. He wanted to make the universe better.... even if he never had the right plan.Also, When Thanos snapped, half the universe died painlessly. No suffering.Fat jokes about Thor.... that Got VERY old very quickly.Captain Marvel should have been killed by thanos. That would have been amazing!!!Thanos throwing Captain Marvel was by far the greatest moment of the movie.Falling back on Time travel is a pathetic way to get the attention of an audience and to save the universe. We've just seen this 1000 times.It was just Painfully overrated.Should have been a 2 hour 15 minute movie overall.Thanos was really the only good character.... because he didn't try to make awkward and cheesy jokes every 10 seconds like every other Avenger lunatic.Iron man snapped thanos out of existence..... That means he's not much nicer than Thanos is.Not the worst movie, just incredibly overrated. It was average, and I'm just being realistic.And about an hour to long."
850,"It's like they wrote the script after 3 AM the day before the deadline. This is the worst Marvel MCU film ever. Even Age of Ultron was seriously better than this,"
851,"I'm sorry but this movie was terrible. Boring and drawn out with some of the laziest writing and script you could imagine. So after the events of infinity war, you half half the population wiped out, Spider-Man, Doctor strange, black panther etc. All turned to dust, iron man stranded on a ship light years away from anything or anyone and we are all thinking ""where could the movie go from here?"", and what is the best the directors could come up with?......""iron man gets saved right at the start of the movie then the avengers that are left will just go back in time and get the stones and save the other ones"". Ads you kidding me?? My 5 year old nephew could come up with better. Not to mention why not just do that in the last movie then?? They then spend the majority of the movie going back in time to previous movies so we can watch all the crap we've already seen. Just so after 2.5 hours we can get back to the exact same battle sequence with thanos and all the avengers as the last movie except in this scenario they get the stones off him. Pathetic. Why call this endgame?? It's already obvious they're gonna make a million more and never stop making this trash."
852,"I found this movie confusing and fragmented ...all over the place. It appears that Thanos, even without the infinity stones can kick ALL the Avengers butts. What???"
853,"Utter crap - left the theater upset and exhausted.
I hate everything about Brie Larson - she's ruining Marvel for me.
Best character development for Thanos completely destroyed. Don't even get me started on Thor.
Give 2 and not 1 for Cap and Stark."
854,"This movie reminds me of ""Back to The future 2"" like doc said, ""don't run into your other self"" and the ending reminded me of ""Inception"" everyone ends up in their own alternate reality. I probably won't watch this movie for a very long time and it's 2 hours of boring-ness. And maybe 45 minutes of action, and the rest of it was cheesy, I just couldn't get teary eyed at the end. Mediocre at best. Btw ""Captain Mar-Vel"" wasn't really relevant and had little screen time, maybe 20-25mins. And Thor is FAT. The end. Glad I didn't waste my own money on this movie."
855,"I am still trying to grapple with what their ""endgame"" was...
This is the very last movie with all the hype around it, and supposed to be THE grand culmination of all earlier 21 MCU movies.However, this is what actually happens -
Thor plays Fat Boy Slim.
Dr. Strange has as many lines to speak as Groot has.
Captain Marvel's only job is to ferry Iron Man's lost ship on her shoulders.
Captain America does not remain Captain America in the end. And simply by physical proximity, Black Panther becomes the new Captain America (I would have taken my shoe off and thrown at the screen, but hey, this scene wasn't worth the price of even my shoes).The only saving grace was perhaps the demise of Iron Man.They basically did a Game of Thrones finale on this one it seems. Maybe 2019 will be remembered as the year when all movie makers lost it."
856,"Bought a ticket on premiere, story has Lots of bugs, doesn't add up!"
857,"After The Davastaed Events Of Last Year's Avengers infinity War Saw All Of Marvel's Awesome And Cool Superheroes Which includes Doctor Strange, Spider-Man, Maria Hill, Nick Fury, Star-Lord, Drax The Destroyer, Mantis, Groot, Scarlet Witch,Vision, Black Panther, The Wasp, The Winter Soldier And The Falcon All Turn To Dust And Ashes By a Snap From The Mad Titan Himself Thanos After He Collected All Six infinity Stones in His Gauntlet.... Now With Last Reminding Survivors Superheroes That includes iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hulk, Rocket Raccoon, War Machine And Thor Are Left Wandering Of What To Do Until Scott Lang Ant Man Who Had Comes Out Of The Quantum Relem And Sees All Of Everyone Are Gone As He Tells The Last Reminding Superheroes That There is a Way To Bring Back All Of The Other Fallen Heros Who All Turned To Dust To Life By Undoing The Snap And Going Back in Time To Collect All Six infinity Stones Before Thanos Gets All Of Them And Try To Undo The Snap And Destroying Thanos For Good This Time And The Result is Yes, Thanks To iron Man Who Scarifices His Life As He Has All Infinity Stones And Undo The Snap But This Time He Mange To Destroy Thanos As He Himself Who Turn To Dust And Ashes And By Saving All Of The Comeback Superheroes. The Verdict is, Robert Downey Jr. in His Last Role As Tony Stark/Iron Man Who Gives One Of His Finest Performance Of a Lifetime, Along With Chris Evans Mark Ruffalo Chris Hemsworth Jeremy Renner Paul Rudd Don Cheadle Karen Gillan And Scarlett Johansson All Deliver First Rate Performances As Well As Black Widow, Captain America, War Machine, Hulk, Thor, Ant Man Nebula And Hawkeye Also Too it Was Great And Cool To See All Of The Other Cast Members Comeback As There Believeable And Iconic Characters in Which includes Bendict Cumberbatch As Doctor Strange, Sebastian Stan As The Winter Soldier, Chadwick Boseman As Black Panther, Elizabeth Olsen As Scarlet Witch, Anthony Mackie As The Falcon, Evangelion Lilly As The Wasp, Dave Bautista As Drax, Chris Pratt As Star Lord, Letitia Wright As Shuri, Danai Gurira As Okoye, Pom Klemetieff As Mantis, Vin Disell As Voice Groot, Zoe Saldana As Gamora, Tom Holland As Spider-Man, Gwyneth Paltrow As Pepper Potts, Brie Larson As Captain Marvel, Benedict Wong As Wong And Tessa Thompson As Valkyrie As They Come And Help Out To Fight And Destroy The Villainess Thanos For One And For All Played By Of Course Josh Brolin. Another Thing Of What i Like About This Final Chapter Of An Avengers Film Are Flashback Scene Sequences Of Seeing All Of The Pervious Cast Who Started in These Marvel Movies Are Robert Redford As The Villian Alexander Pierce And Frank Grillo As Brock Rumlow Both From""Captain America"": The Winter Soldier"", Nalalie Portman As Jane Foster And Rene Russo As Frigga Thor's Mother From The First ""Thor"" Film And it's Sequel, Tom Huddleston As Loki From The First Avengers Movie"", Tilda Swinton As ""The Ancient One From ""Doctor Strange"" John Slattery As Howard Stark Tony Stark's Father From ""Iron Man 2"", And Hayley Atwell As Steve Roger's Girlfriend Margaret Carter. Anyways Avengers Endgame is Truly One Of The Best And Perhaps The Greatest Final Avengers Film Of All Time With Action-Packed Moment Scenes, it's a Little Bit Of Emotional At Times Epespecially Since The Scene That involves Black Widow Who Scarifices Herself To Retrieve The Soul Stone And Avengers Endgame Has Great Humor Moments As Well. P.S. This Final Avengers Film Goes Out To The Great Late Stan Lee And For All Of His Cameo Appreances in Every Marvel Superhero Movie That He Started in."
858,Waste of money.. if this was nr 1 of 2 I wouldn't have seen nr 2.
859,"Let me first tell you that I am a big fan of the marvel movie franchise. Never read any comic book. I generally enjoy superhero movies.This review would be disliked but I have to say this, this was the worst marvel movie after iron Man 2 for me. Some movies have loopholes in their script but this movie has some script in the loopholes.
I guess this movie is getting such high reviews(near fight club and Lord of the rings) as people are emotional about the characters and they would think with their heart and not their brain. But if you actually think about the movie, that is , take your brain with you to the theatre, you would start observing the huge loopholes.
And I do want to clear it out that I am not a person who is very picky about the story. I accept some flaws in a movie. But in this movie there are so many flaws that it becomes hardly acceptable.
It was so bad that it killed all my interest in future superhero movies."
860,"I am a huge fan of this franchise, which is the only reason I'm providing a review at all. This is merely an observation rather than providing a lengthy unnecessary review like every other person has. Having said that, my biggest question is why couldn't one of iron man's other unmanned super bots that he created perform the snap instead of him? They clearly should have had the ability to harness the power of the infinity stones."
861,"Three hours . Blimey, what a long film. Dull too ..same old same old. Thor was cool - the rest were not. My 12 year old loved it though - so I guess that's the key. But god it's a long haul. and too noisy to sleep."
862,"If you have such wealth of acting at your disposal but reduce most of your cast to cameo appearances the story suffers. Some of the cameos were great to watch, they are the world's best known actors after all, but to me it was just a bit too much of everything and I lost interest when I lost count of all the characters, plots and subplots. I think I like it better when they focus on one or a few superheroes. High points of the movie: any scene with Tony Stark or Thor, but why use a star like Nathalie Portman when all she has to do is look pretty and walk around a bit, it makes you wonder whether these stars are short on money though. My grandson loved it though."
863,"Thanos is spectacular villain.but besides that movie is overrated (not as overrated as Infinity war).Thanos lost because Nebula's convincing ability with 2sentences ??why Thanos didn't go for glove himself?.Captain Marvel tries to look badass but it looks cringe and etc.
Anyway, don't see me as a hater.Marvel charachters doesn't give me goosebumps like you.that is why i can evaluate it without being hyped"
864,"The last 45 minutes was Epic in terms of action, sadly the poor writing and story telling for the rest of the movie did not make up for this. The movie effectively ignored 10 years worth of development, potential, and character qualities to tell a poor quality temporal Ocean's 11 which couldn't even maintain it's credibility within the same movie. Questions that have been building for a half dozen movies to this point just got tossed to the wayside and ignored. Thanos's entire development as a character of value in Infinity war gets relegated to the chopping room floor (quite literally) in the first 10 minutes, leaving a pale, cruel, and thoroughly dis-interesting variant for the rest of the movie. The entire conflict of ideologies which built up in Infinity War gets ignored. The soul stone goes from conscience to pure sadist with no redeeming value except to give an excuse to kill main characters for no reason. So much potential wasted and in it's place an overall poor entry. It was so pathetic it has put me off the rest of the movies for a while."
865,"Personally as person who isn't too much into all this comic book stuff, I watched this and it wasn't even mediocre. This was a terrible movie. The drama, characters and action all where really bad. There were still some good scenes in the movie, however over the 3 hour long movie, most of it was terrible. A lot of the acting felt forced, especially with the female superhero actors. There was not a good presentation or an interesting and surprising ending. Not to mention the terrible comedy spread throughout the film. Constantly repeating jokes that were not funny, and lots of references that were rather unfunny and forced.This felt like a nerdy fan film sequel to the really good movie, infinity war."
866,"Not bad but it's the weakest avenger movie.
It's just mediocre"
867,"Wow! What a conclusion!All these years of getting to know these characters, their struggles, the extreme conflicts, failures, and successes -- all concluded with a syrupy, tear-jerking, emotional roller coaster final episode. In this case, I immediately felt that sense of emotional satisfaction that many of the 10/10ers have given this movie. I would have probably have given it an 8/10 if someone was exit-polling the viewers. A day or two of reflection, however, have left a bitter aftertaste, and I realize that this entire Endgame story just doesn't work. Maybe the next movie, MCU will start that movie with a ""just kidding...""In afterthought, the storytelling in this movie feels like when I was in creative writing in school and got tired of writing, so created my conclusion really quickly just to be done and make my teacher and fellow students ""feel good"".1. MCU took the last several years and hours of our lives investing in all these characters, their lives, and their pathos and washed it all down the drain with a simple, illogical, complete suspension of belief time travel ""do-over"" that didn't even stay consistent with its own rules. By doing this, they in effect wiped out all the events of all the movies that led up to this one, while still arguing that the present timeline was intact. In essence, IW never happened...also - Ant-man came back because of a rat running across a touch screen and accidentally hitting all the right buttons (why not use some intentionality with Ghost here or something more believable)? The most powerful being in the universe has better things to do with her time (Cap'n Marvel). Nick Fury has one appearance, when he was so integral to the Avengers coming together. Where was the complete repeal of the Sokovia Accords that created the dissension within the Avengers and the entire remnants of the earth asking the avengers for vengeance, instead of just walking around monuments to the missing? Where was the coming back of Hulk that was setup so brilliantly in IW?2. Hulk - what happened? He was a complete non-entity when IW set up his ""coming out"" for this movie to be one of high expectation from IW as well as him being sent back to earth for that very reason.3. Thor, while I could accept his depression and obesity, I expected him to regain his ""godlike"" qualities at some point, but instead he became just a pathetic human character at-best. And all the time spent in Ragnarok showing him to be the leader and king of the Asgardians and earning that right, to just give it up so easily? Really? What a waste watching Ragnarok was in hindsight, if that was the case.4. Cap'n Marvel - defeating the one being in all the universe that has created trillions of sudden deaths is less important than helping those planets recover, even though the one responsible for the deaths is still alive; yet you have enough omnipresence that you happen to come in just at the right time to only do a minor work that keeps the action going and not having all the Avengers get killed? You can destroy a ship by flying through it, withstand, the entire power of Thanos without flinching or moving, and yet, you can't stay around and destroy him?5. Scarlet Witch - Thanos, you're going to know who I am, yet all you do is throw a few rocks at him? You're way more powerful than that.6. Hawkeye - whoever saw him as a main character whose pathos would be preeminent over Black Widow or anyone else? Have I even cared about Hawkeye as a main character at all to this point?7. Cap'n America - so, you get your happy ending, but in essence, you change the timeline for all the movies that have been created up to Endgame, yet everything is still supposed to be legitimate in the present?8. Nebula - you kill your earlier self, yet you stay alive in the present? Somehow your earlier self has all the memories of your later self (I'm still confused on how that was possible or even could happen), and that alters the timeline for Thanos, yet it doesn't affect the present, somehow?I could go on and on, but I think I would have given this an 8 or even a 10 when leaving the theater, because Cap'n America and Stark's conclusions hit my emotions so strongly, as well as finally seeing the satisfying defeat of such a formidable dark force as Thanos and the impassive destruction he caused in IW. However, I hesitate to drop a 5 on it now, based on the incredulity of feeling like my entire intelligence was completely insulted. It's like MCU created this final episode and is comically laughing all the way to the bank with all the money and time we fans have spent investing in the franchise, as if to say...""you suckers..."""
868,I wish that everyone would get back to making action movies and try not to be so PC. There was more blue steel in this movie than zoolander. Not to mention a million plot holes.
869,"Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before.The characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three"
870,"The reason I rated this movie at 1/10 is that it is the finale to the 22 Marvel movies and the sequel to the greatest of them, Infinity War. Maybe if I have watched it as a standalone superhero movie I would have given it 5 or 6/10.First, time travel? Seriously? We waited all this time for this. I didn't know want to know anything about the movie and had really high expectations, but had I known they elected to choose time travel as the solution for getting everyone back I wouldn't have rushed to the movies to watch it. It is as lame as the time travel movies that were mocked in endgame and such movies can only have a specific fanbase. You can't just throw in a bunch of quantum physics and I don't know what and suddenly it all becomes possible. Nebula fighting with another Nebula, captain America fighting with captain America from another time? Seriously I can't believe the team behind it was that desperate to come up with these freaking ideas.Second and more importantly, where is the action in this movie? Almost 15 minutes out of the 3 hours where all avengers fight randomly against all villains. No fun whatsoever. Was this supposed to be a movie for everyone to enjoy, or a tribute to the MCU universe? Almost 3 hours of drama and jokes that are out of context. If I wanted to watch a comedy or drama I would have gone elsewhere. When I go watch a superhero movie, I expect a lot of action and CGI, remember infinity war, and this movie has nothing to offer.Now I must comment on the high ratings that this movie receives. I believe most people will have rated the movie high regardless of whether good or bad, just because it is the last avengers movie and sequel to infinity war. Truth is the movie is really bad. But I wouldn't recommend anyone not to watch it, after all everyone wants to know how it ends, which is also why the movie is breaking box office records, just don't have high expectations, because this is the most dull, unsatisfying finale the MCU can offer."
871,"Nowadays it is like a crime to say bad things against Marvel movies but someone has to tell the truth
This movie is extremely over-hyped. The first 2 hours there was almost no action, it was unnecessary endless dialogs, flashbacks and seconds chances.
When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again.
I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much?
Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action.
If it was up to me i would wait for torrents buy my gf wanted to see so much and in the end she also got disappointed."
872,"I have given a lower rating to this movie in the context of a follow up to infinity war. I cannot believe the hype and positive critical reviews given to this movie. There are some glaring plot holes that just cannot be ignored like
Steve Rogers going back in time and preferring to live an ordinary life with Peggy Carter and never being Captain America!
The God of Thunder and the big angry Hulk being reduced to a laughing stock.
The supporting villains seem to have absolutely no impact whatsoever rendering them redundant. and finally
Thanos - the most refreshing and complex characters of IW being reduced to a generic villain.
Robert Downing Junior is the one saving grace of the movie."
873,"I think how viewers receive this movie is dependent upon when you were born. I was 12 years old and glued to our big screen color TV on 9/8/66 for the premier of Star Trek. I still have my Leonard Nimoy autographed fan club membership cards from 1966-69. I was in the audience in 1977 opening weekend of Star Wars after a 3+ hour wait in line. What the Marvel team created here was nothing short of spectacular. To bring these characters to life, weave their stories together bringing some to a close and launching others while still managing to cross the T and for the I, well that's epic. I've experienced a few."
874,It was everything for me. The way they linked all the ends was marvelous. I found all the happiness and sadness at the same time. Love you Iron man 3000. And now we all do know who's Captain. And sadest thing was to lose widow. And I still love Red witch She was incredible. At the end Thank You Marvel.
875,"By far, the worst Avenger movie among four, particulary for retiring certain key characters. In such drama, it make sense that someone should be making an ultimate sacrifice, which in this case Iron Man was the best candidate. But Natasha not being able to come after the snap by Hulk and/or worse, Captain America going back to live with her old love after carrying her coffin was quite awful!"
876,"I will write this review as a way to unload how frustrated I feel after watching this movie.First and foremost, Tony Stark's plan to bring everyone back after a 5 year gap is absurd and selfish. After 5 years you should be able to balance the choice of leaving everything as it is OR going back and changing everything back to how it was. Keep in mind 5 years is a very long time to have been pronounced dead. The paperwork to bring these people back into the system and the burden they will now be on the economy and Social Security, at least for a while, would be enough to bankrupt a nation. Conveniently, all MCU's family and friends were either fine or they had all vanished together so having them come back unharmed, albeit 5 years later, is a relief. That is not likely the case for the rest of the world though. Most of the people coming back are coming back to a drastically changed world. Most will be homeless, they have no jobs, no way of getting a job, not soon enough, anyway. Some will have lost family members and beloved pets during that time, to old age, suicide, accidents and all sorts of natural causes. And some, if not most, will be coming back to a world that moved on without them. Their loved ones may have already found others or have been changed so drastically that they're strangers now. If you watched Tom Hank's ""Cast Away"" and recall his hopelessness after coming back to life to find his house sold, his insurance cashed, his job taken, his industry changed, his wife remarried... Now multiply that by half of the Universe's life forms and you have an unmitigated tragedy of cosmic proportions. All so that Tony gets to keep his 4-year-old?
No. Tony Stark's toughest choice should have been that. Am I willing to sacrifice my daughter to save half the life in the Universe? After that, snapping your fingers knowing you will die should be a piece of cake.And then the time travel ordeal... If the operating theory is that you cannot change the past then you should be unable to change the past, PERIOD. The only things that can happen are the things that have already happened. In that scenario, it is plausible to assume you'll be able to go back in time, steal the Infinity Stones unnoticed and then but them back... But all of this is only possible IF they have already happened. Complicated yet theoretically possible. You can even justify Thor's conversation with his mom or the Ancient One's chat with Banner because we were unaware that these things had already happened then, even if it is our first time seeing it. But then you have the Cap fighting with himself and telling other's he's with Hydra, Loki's escape and the cap moving back to the past to grow old together with his long lost love. You could argue that the Cap made himself forget the fight with the scepter and lived secretly in a basement for the rest of his life, but REALLY? And what about all the undercover Hydra operatives that will soon find that the Cap is not really on their side and hence must know of their own involvement and what about Loki? How was he still a prisoner for the end scene in Avengers when Thor escorts him back to Assgard and where he is later seen in prison? And how are we reconstructing the Tesarract and putting the Ether back into Natalie Portman? Or CAN you change the past after all? So why not do the unthinkable and kill one baby (Thanos) to save half the Universe? Send Hawkeye and Black Widow to do it. Why not travel in time to beat Thanos at Wakanda, now with the help of the entire team, including all of the dispersed heroes and Captain Marvel? Or did we just create 6 different alternate realities and timelines but somehow feel good about our victory in just this one? And is the Cap comfortable going back to 1945, hanging his shield and watching history unfold without altering a single thing, knowing full well all the lives he could've saved (think Vietnam, Kennedy, 9/11, etc.)?And how does every single main character survive the final battle? They blew the Avengers headquarters to smithereens yet they're all somehow unscathed sub-level 20, just brushing off the dust. Or when Thanos made it rain fire? I get some are meta-humans but others have latex suits and some body armor, nothing more. How are there not more casualties?I could've lived with Thor's beer-belly, the new Hulk and the rest of the idiotic jokes if the movie itself weren't a joke already. The logic seems off and I am just thinking about this now. These people had 10 years to write a better story. The movie was made painfully long because of gaping plot holes rather than by great writing."
877,"Dont miss understand my title, I'm a huge fan of the Avengers, even more I have watched the 20 movies for the past month in anticipation for the ENDGAME.. However after watching it I'm really disappointed 😥 for the below:
1- First half an hour was really disappointing. I mean after making a full movie on Thanos, the avengers killed him that easily !!!! Come on .. the writers shouldn't expect us to be this fool?
2- Thor being fat and not funny ?? Comeon he fought battles and lost all of his family and friends & Asgard & he was still standing ?? So what changed that he became that desperate?? Totally un believeable and weird.
3- Time Travel ??? Are we in the 90s or 80s !!! Comeon it's so lame and unbelievable.. otherwise Stark should have thought about it straight after thanos happened, & not wait for an ANT stupid as a rock to tell him.
4- Killing the black widow is not believable ?? Since when they love each other that much ??? Doesnt this arrow man has wife and kids & black widow love Hulk !!
5- We all new that iron man was going to be killed , so no surprise in that??
6- No action whatsoever, as the only 20 minutes came from the ending were everyone was already starting to sleep, & it was not so good.Overall, long wait to end up with bullocks, very disappointing writing , & 3 hours of wasting time .... Wish they had put more thought in it , and give the fans an enjoyable movie, instead of this waste of time."
878,"For me, very boring and the characters persona as they were before just ruined in this movie.
I have greatly enjoyed every Marvel movie except this one."
879,All i can say is for us Thor fans this movie was the ultimate slap in the face. apart from a couple scenes that shone...the rest was absolute garbage. i can comfortably say Infinity war was way better and garbage is a movie im 100% sure i will never watch again in my life. And Ive never said that about a movie. Dont believe the hype and don't waste your money.
880,All over the place & all in all very dissapointing - even some of marvel characters have morphed into embarrassing caricatures. Is it the writers fault or have some of the actors got a bit too much influence? ..... I don't get what planet anyone who gives thos film 5/10 is living on let alone all the 9/10 and 10/10 rating ... The mind boggles ....
881,"BORING!!! TOO LONG!!! Two of the main characters, changed for wearing diapers. DISAPPOINTING."
882,"I am a huge sci-fi fan. I really like marvel movies but not a MCU person. If you liked all MCU movies and are a marvel fan don't read anymore just go see it, I'm sure you'll love it. I have to admit Infinity wars was a very good movie and easily re-watchable. I was very upset at the ending and the twisting of spiderman dying. Now spoilers (duh).
What I didn't like
(1) 2 hours and 40 minutes of dialog and 20 minutes of cheesy CGI.
(2) Thanos please shut up. Please, you talk way tfm.
(3) Woke much. Blacktain America. Power Puff Girls, CA therapy new age session
(4) Captain Marval is way too powerful, why do we even need the avengers?
(5) So predictable but you knew I was going to say that.
(6) Time Travel sucks but what are you going to do over and over again.
(7) Thor belly gut funny for 1 minutes, then super sad.
(8) I was dragged to this movie by my kids
(9) RDJ got like 100M for this stupid thing. Girls, Shmirls...hiding under a bar
(10) Comedy was terrible. Only 2 jokes I liked.
(11) Drama Queen Thanos gets two deaths?
(12) I feel bad for Peter Quill. Gomarah was resurrected but doesn't know him.What I liked
(1) Go eat a salad...great line.
(2) Tony Stark meeting his father. Very heartwarming. Only nice moment."
883,If I could erase this film from my memory that would be great. I am going to go with avengers ending after infinity war. I'm not sure why people are worried about spoilers as the same thing happens in every movie. If you haven't seen the film yet think of the stupidest thing you could imagine then try and complicate it by banging on for 3 hours and it will be pretty close to this absolute trash of a film.
884,Story line is not good..lots of plot hole...Forcely added emotional scene..Good part of movie is thanos..
885,"I actually enjoyed Infinity War very much. The best part of that movie was the villain Thanos. He wasn't just another baddie. He clearly had a complex (and intelligent) character and the audience could associate with some of his ideas and philosophy. That interesting complexity and dialogue that he brought to the table was absent or minimal in this movie.This movie was disappointing because of:1) Thanos' portrayal2) Minor characters like Hawkeye given way too much screen time.3) Thor and Hulk never snapped back to their old great selves (was waiting for it but it didn't happen). I actually enjoyed fat Thor and found it funny but was disappointed we did not get to see classic Thor by the end, even for a moment.4) Captain Marvel clearly had too much power and could have almost single-handedly dealt with Thanos. It felt like the writers just gave the most paper thin excuse to keep her away.5) In Infinity War one actually felt sad when Spider Man perished in Iron Mans arms. I felt something deeply profound with the ending scene in Infinity War when Thanos could finally sit and rest to watch the sun set over the new universe he had created. The emotional scenes and deepness in this movie were just not at the same level.6) The time-travel and quantum physics scenes were confusing or at best not well explained (and I say that as someone with a PhD in Astrophysics!).7) The last fight scene seemed to be a (cheaper) copy of the Infinity War scene.Personally I would give Infinity War a 8.5 and Endgame around a 6. However, seeing how many people are (ridiculously, in my opinion) giving this a 10, to try restore some semblance of balance, I will give it a 1."
886,This movie is so long and boring don't understand where the hype is! Not any close to infinity war! Senseless! Please save your 3hrs! Trust me
887,"What the.... did Disney do? I know the wannabe cinema fan will be like ""that was a well deserved ending""... Like how? The story does not add up.. Really does not make sense... The solution to try save everyone is like xmen day of the future past concept ""reset button""The actors really Marvell this shows that Disney is loosing it with there political agenda? All the scenes she was in felt like a reshoot.. Like they had no plans for Marvell and it was forced!
Thor... What a.... shameWhere are the times that you could actually expect spectacular scene action worthy moment.... Instead of a.... comedy show full of meme!!!We are not a generation who are brain dead yet!!
I wiil stick to the comics and leave the cinema to the real fans!"
888,"What a great entertainer. One of the finest movies of recent times. Everyone thought storyline will be predictable. But it actually isn't. We witnessed so twist and turn in the movie. It was emotional and chances are that you will leave the theatre crying and heartbroken. Overall I think it's a great farewell to avengers. Thank you MCU for another masterpiece.
I give 10/10 to this last Avenger movie. Go and watch this epic movie."
889,Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...
890,Nothing special. It was boring. I'd rather watch the phantom menace.
891,"Infinity War is a Masterpiece and there is no comparison between IW and Endgame more like EndLame.
This movie is full of plotholes , poorly written dramatic scenes and not so funny funny scenes.
Why does Ironman has to die , why he had to wear the gauntlet to snap Thanos when they were going to beat Thanos anyway. Fat thor, useless Hulk, ant-man , captain marvel, hawkeye, captain America , black panther, doctor strange, spiderman , Ironman etc all were there. There was no need of that end snap. I know they wanted to give Iron man a farewell but in a satisfying way, in movie it felt like it was totally useless. And what about Hulk and thanos encounter , oh yeah there wasn't one. I was waiting for proffessor Hulk to step up to Thanos , another disappointment.
Many people liked the last interaction between Hawkeye and Black widow but personally found it cringy and over dramatic with lame writing.
In IW you can clearly see every character was given their share of screen time and justified roles but Endgame was mess .
I have watched IW in theatres 4 times plus many times at home and i would still watch it and enjoy but Endgame i can't.
Many stupid fanboys and casual watchers might find this movie good but the people who likes things making sense and a story which takes you deep into it would feel how unsatisfying this movie is .
Even casting Brie Larson as captian marvel wasn't that bad as this movie .Last words : Infinity War wasn't the movie we deserved but It was the movie we needed.
And this movie (Endgame) is not even close to what it should be."
892,"This movie was a waste of time. I went to see this movie expecting something epic... more epic than Infinity War but was grossly disappointed. Movie was too slow, no action, much drama. I thought this was a comic movie? I wish I could give this movie 0/10."
893,"If you're a big Hulk fan don't waste your time or money!3 hour movie and not any Hulk smash action?!?! Really! Extremely disappointing! I didn't expect Hulk to take the lead but come on, really! They misrepresented professor Hulk. When the Hulk found out Nat died he should've went into worldbreaker Hulk and put Thanos in the ground. Most of the other avengers had their shot at Thanos. Huge battle at the end and, you guessed it, no Hulk action. Not even 5 minutes of the big guy getting angry. They put the Hulk on the sidelines for the last 2 avengers and emasculated him. Horrible! The worst Avenger movie. Oh yeah, fat Thor and gay support group Cap, bad move. They took the 2 most powerful Avengers Hulk and Thor pussified and neutered them. Gross!Because of this movie I will not watch another marvel movie!"
894,"Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
895,"I think the movie is selling only due to it's predecessors, most of whom were built with great care and vision.
action wise, infinity war was way ahead of this slow paced dashed hope.
only relief at the end is that thankfully it's over and they can now focus on movies with one or two superheroes at max."
896,"I gave this title a 4. I have long been a fan of Marvel films and this especially after infinity war left me with disappointment.Firstly the film is needlessly long, there are blocks of time that could be cut out and it would only have served to make the film better.Secondly is about the Hulk. Never have I been so disappointed with directors and a main character. We all know the story from Infinity war, Thanos batters hulk, and hulk goes into hiding. We also all know that the hulk has immeasurable power and strength. Que what we all wanted to see. HULK RAGE, not so half attempt at hipster hulk who is all in touch with his emotions. We wanted to see Hulk go HULK on Thanos, the most likely thing her was going to do was discuss beard growing tactics - pathetic.Needless to say there are A LOT of plot holes in this film, with unfortunately no end is sight for terrible characters such as HawkEye or Buckey (whose only power is being able to use a gun!?).That said the end battle sequence was good (thus the 4 rating).The light at the end of the tunnel is that there is remake after remake, so maybe on the remake we will all get what we are looking for... HULK SMASSSSSHHHH"
897,"Don't get your hopes up, i literally cannot understand the high ratings for this movie, bad pace, bad story, Thor and hulk were both a joke in this movie, Infinity War was light years better..."
898,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.
899,"Most annoying avenger movie, thor totally over shadowed, no charm n charizma of thor in a single scene....captain n iron man finished... captain would never choose his own self over the world ... you guys just had to finish his character so you took this irritating story line where catain stayed with peggy.. no goose bumps throughout the whole movie"
900,"Don't listen to all other bad reviews. This movie was amazing! A perfect ending to all other marvel movies we've seen in the last ten years. I've never sobbed and smiled this much ever since Titanic. Well done, Marvel. Well done."
901,I gave this movie five stars for effects but for story not so great and i expected at this happy ending i didn't expect that bit of drama but anyway dissapointed especially the way Thanos end in the movie so lame exactly like NK in GOT so lame when you expect at something more but no this is a proof if you rush something you ruin it the note is 8.7 just because effects and is marvel nothing more.
902,"Was expecting much more with the end game but came out of theatre with disappoinment .Dont know why story was weak
all about creating a time machine go back in time and change everything which happened.
all i wanted to say is it could be way more better"
903,"Warning spoilers a plenty.I thought it was utter rubbish, complete drivel. Nearly everything was off and wrong about this bore-fest.Almost nothing happened. It was so boring. Virtually the entire first 90 minutes could have been trimmed to about 15 mins.Pacing was terrible, it lost all momentum at times and was tedious.
The feel of the film, was all over the place, jumping from very dumb childish comedy to attempted serious drama and then to social commentary. It didn't natural have a core or flow to the film.So many stupid, misplaced scenes, such as the ""girl power"" nonsense, so contrived.Massive plot holes. I know Time Travel is a very difficult subject to tackle, but this made little sense. Either you cannot change the past or you can? This sometimes does and other times doesn't. If you steal the Stones then try to put them back. In theory they haven't been stolen, as you can't change the past, therefore, how can you put them back? How on earth did Captain America manage to put the Stones back and Thor's hammer and presumably the Green girl? They erased Thanos and the Robot girl in same timeline as well and that didn't effect anything?Apparently you can't kill a baby Thanos, but you can kill a slightly younger adult version of Thanos when he comes to the future that is okay.How did Capt A, put the Stones back at the exact time they left, without interfering with the original operation to retrieve them or changing the past anyway.The cringe worthy comedy was awful. There was a serious tone to Avengers, but this just turned into a cheap gag reel. Thors (a god) getting fat. Hulk getting fans.Corny cheap false scenes with Tony and his daughter, with the terrible music playing at the same time, like some cheap matinee from the 50's.Overall there was no feeling or emotion, the funeral scene was false and contrived.Pepper Potts is now Iron Woman?Spider-man goes back to school, after 5 years away? Really?I saw it with my teenage Daughter, she thought it was crap and we heard most people around us saying the same thing.A real stinker this one. 0/10."
904,"What can I say the title says it all, the director is really screwed up with the hulk he didn't even have a decent fight scene. The story it was kind of boring also fell asleep practically in the middle of the movie. This movie felt like a Hollywood director made it instead of a real fan the way it should have been made. And the CGI was horrible"
905,"It's the finale! But they choose to not focus on CGI, EDITING, SOUNDTRACK, CINEMATOGRAPHY, even in storyline! (Time travel, paradox, time here is 5 hours, there is 5 seconds) Same old story! Nothing new, nothing special! They made this movie only to remind us the old MCU movies, it's funny, it's pathetic! Zero new elements, zero imagination! It was 2 hours and 30 minutes pointless and only 30 mins worth! ( Black Widow storyline, Iron Man storyline) About Captain America, they give him poor ending, about Thor, they made him a Joke! About Hulk, they made him powerless! About the other characters, they put them in the movie only to say that they put them! And finally, ZERO PURE SUPERHERO ACTION!!! Only 10-15 minutes, only!! For me, its one of the most overrated movies of all time! Disappointed."
906,"What the hell did you do, a comedy serosuly.
so Thor could have nearly killed thanos in the first move with the infinity gauntlet, but in the second move with 2 hammers they couldn't land a fatel blow really guys!!!
pym particals seriously this is the direction you chose, from all materials you have you chose pym particals.
then we have the hulk that has been totally destroyed don't get me started on Thor"
907,"What a waste of time! Let's start by: Why the hell did they put Thor dumb, fat, drunk, a loser, and as the laughing stock?? And why on earth was the Hulk smaller, thinner, weaker and stupid?? Why was Thanos stronger without the infinity stones?? And can someone tell me why Captain Marvel was so useless - it was pointless having her in this film; I have no idea why they worked so hard in adding her character into the film, when she clearly did absolutely nothing! Captain Marvel failed along with the whole other 150 woman failed. Girl power at its best. Captain Marvel was powerless, pointless and ridiculed in front of the world watching this stupid film. I'm sorry, 20 Avengers and none of them couldn't do anything??? And why did Tony had to die out of all the other characters?? Seriously, couldn't Falcon, Dr. Strange or Mantis die instead - they were good for nothing. And how did Falcon get to be Captain America? What about Bucky-- War Machine-- heck even Rocket would have been better. A good 45 minutes of poor blah blah that could have been used for action fight scenes. Disappointments everywhere."
908,Trying to avoid spoilers while expressing why so much of this film is just a fan service dues ex machina is just too difficult. A disappointing and cheap end to a decade's worth of popcorn films.
909,More than half of the movie is boring with a very bad script
910,"Seemed like 20 minutes of action at the most out of 3 hours. The film didnt need to be that long. The scenes that were meant to be emotional were executed poorly, didnt make me feel anything other than boredom. Seems all the 10 star ratings are just from marvel fans! Face it guys, it is a bad film. The previous avengers was 1000x better. The whole length of infinity war was about them defeating thanos, in this film it took them 20 minutes."
911,"You can't go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending."
912,"Plot holes, inconsistent and too much messing with established characters. Hulk is pointless. Might as well just kept him as banner.Ps why aren't half of Parker's mates 21 years old in the new Spider-Man film!?!"
913,"No Spoilers
This movie epitomises why I no longer pay to go to the cinema. It must be a free ticket and I must be bored. Those are my two criteria. It is therefore quite ironic that this film is boring. Was I not clear in my criteria. I said ""I must be bored"". NOT I want to see a BORING film! I quite enjoyed Infinity Wars to some extent but this film was just plain stupid. It must have been written by the children of the directors. It's that bad. I tried to tolerate this film as much as possible, started falling asleep then pinched myself and thought, ""what tf am I doing here?"" and walked out!"
914,I slept during movie first time in my entire life.I can bare any kind of movie in my life but this was litery garbage movie. My humble request is to stay at home give time to ur family dont waste money on this movie.
915,"I'm not even sure where to start. I had high expectations ever since I've walked out from IW premiere. Those expectations are further fueled up by all the good reviews and 10/10 ratings this movie received. But, after watching a movie, I'm quite sure that all those reviews and ratings have been sponsored. There is no other explanation. I've also heard stories about people crying, laughing and cheering throughout the movie and giving standing ovations after the movie ended. I'm not sure are those stories made up or what, but in theater where I was, we had like two laughs, some WTFs, multiple yawns and not much else. As matter a fact, I've never seen so many people playing with their phones during a Marvel movie. Never ever. It was that boring.Now, don't get me wrong, the movie is somewhat watchable, but I beleive the fans deserved much more than ""watchable"" for this final installment of the franchise. I could basically write a book about what's wrong with this movie, but won't as I've already spend too much time on this abomination. What's the use of it anyway. Fanboys will praise this movie no matter what and disregard all the arguments against it. Movie creators are already counting all the billions they've earned by breaking every box office record there is. The only ""victims"" here are the true fans who actually appreciate Stan Lee's life work, but they probably already share my opinion anyway. I will, however, throw down a few things that ruined this movie for me, just so I can take it off my chest.Action balance is terrible. In the first 2 hours, basically nothing happens and what does happen makes no sense. There is almost no action and the storyline is all over the place. And then, all of a sudden the whole hell breaks loose. That wouldn't be so bad if the final batlle was spectacular as it should be, but it wasn't. It was a 15 minutes of pure chaos and CGI showcase. It wasn't clear who does what, who fights who... no coreography, no signature moves... nothing.Screen time balance was terible as well. I understand the idea to focus on the original avengers squad, but that's not the reason to give like 90% of the screen time to them (with addition of Ant-man) and like 10% to other 50 characters in the MCU. Basically, no one got more than 60 seconds of total screen time, including Captain Marvel who supposed to be a big part of the movie. With most characters, it felt more like a slide show of cameos, rather than integral part of the story.Most of the characters from the original avengers squad are ruined. I understand that they needed to close their story arc somehow, but was this the right way? Should it be this anti-climactic? Captain America turning into a grandpa? Mighty Hulk becoming clumsy scientest who won't even fight anymore? I kid you not, he didn't throw a single punch the entire move. He basically became the most useless character in MCU. Thor becoming a fat, depressed alcoholic who plays Fortnite and argues with kids on the Internet? Really? The god of thunder? Black Widow meeting the most anti-climactic end imaginable? Couldn't she at least have one more fight scene with her signature moves as we've seen in some previous MCU movies? Couldn't Hulk have at least one more ""Hulk Smash"" moment? Couldn't Hawkeye show off his archery skills once again? Shouldn't they go with a bang? They deserved it and the fans deserved it.Why there is no consistency with most character's powers. I mean, at one moment it looks like Captain Marvel can destroy Thanos and his entire army all by herself, but the next one she looks like a houswive who can be thrown around by her drunk husbend with a bad attitude. The same goes for Scarlett Witch. Also, it looks like any character has more chance to win when fighting Thanos alone than they do when going 10 on one. Just makes no sense.Everything looks rushed up. The main story is all over the place. The entire time travel plot is a mess. Fight scenes are not coreographed well, so it's difficult to follow what's going on most of the time. There is no character development. They just pop up out of nowhere. Humor is forced and out of the place most of the time.I guess the movie creators just wanted to add too much into this movie, but achieved quite the opposite result. Anyway, the best course of action would be to rename this move to ""Iron man 4"" and create another Avengers movie, but do it properly this time."
916,"THE WORST !!!
they turned what should have been the best comic book plot, into a bollywood melodrama, it's just pathetic.
don't waste your time watching babies material."
917,"Thor is represented like a 5 year old girl. I'll explain it below. There are so many plot holes, unnecessary extended dialogue scenes but no action to satisfy except for 8-10 minutes in the second part. It really is boring.You see, there are epic scenes in movie series, especially in the finale of so called movie series which people -even after years- turn back and watch on internet and have fun and get pleasure from it. There are none in this garbage.
For example;
In HP:
Dumbledore vs VoldemortBattle of HogwartsDumbledore's fire spell in the 6th movieThe scene in which Voldemort was destroying the protection spell of HogwartsIn LOTR:
Gandalf vs BalrogThe whole battle of Helm's Deep, plus RohirrimRohirrim's arrival in ROKThe scene in which the eagles and Gandalf saved Frodo and Sam... I can give countless example.But there are none in this finale. In this garbage, all we have is utter disappointment, stupid jokes, no action.Here comes the spoiler:
Spoiler
Ok, I know that mjolnir was lifted in the comics by some other characters as well but this is NOT an excuse for Thor, being so useless and unable to use Mjolnir with his might whereas Captain America beats Thanos with the combos that even Thor couldn't perform. In Infinity War, Thor slashed Thanos even though Thanos had the gauntlet. But in this movie, Thor fights like a 5 year old. He could do nothing against Thanos even though Thanos wasn't wearing the gauntlet and Thor was using both mjolnir and stormbreaker. Captain America saved Thor from being killed by Thanos by using mjolnir. Stupidity doesn't end here guys. Captain America hit Thanos with lightining and threw Thanos and smashed him to the ground by using lightining with the help of mjolnir. They showed Thor like a garbage can, a comic relief. Where is the power of Thor? We know, we get it; Thor is in depression but just because he is in depression, it doesn't mean that he lost his powers. It's all american propaganda; giving all the powers and might to Captain America and destroying other characters. It's all contradictions. So Thor can't be able to use his godly powers but Captain America uses those powers? Ffs, wtf? Sorry but it's not possible for Thor to be weaker than Cap. America. I can't believe that Captain America was turned into Thor. Where is the power of Thor that we saw in Thor (2011), where is the power of Thor that we saw in Ragnarok, where is the power of Thor that we saw in Infinity War. Do you expect us to believe that Thor lost his godly powers in 5 years and he can't summon a storm, lightining but a Captain America can?
Don't forget that same Odin who said ""whoever is worthy, shall possess the power of Thor"" also said ""Are you God of Hammers? That hammer was to help you control your power, to focus it, was never the source of your strength."" There should have been balance. Marvel overlooked so many things. They could have done the same here. They could have reflect Captain in a more respectable way to audience without destroying Thor and undermining his background. I don't care about how much you children downvote. It's an utter disrespect for the funs. Garbage is garbage. As an Mcu fan, I feel sad for what they did.A piece of garbage."
918,The best part of this episode was that Thor has put a few extra pounds on him. And that pretty much says it all.
919,"After all the hype and build up for this I was expecting a little more than a romantic end to the MCU's most beloved franchise. Plot holes, character development and all around story really made the experience less than memorable. In the people that loved it or disliked it that I've talked to I feel like a 50/50 split is what I'm hearing although after enjoying the previous marvel films. I do not know if the people who rated it so high just feel an obligation to themselves to say they loved it so in their heart they weren't let down or that they did truly enjoy this giant mess of a movie. Take the popularity out of the franchise I think if this was released at the beginning of the MCU the rest wouldn't have done as well. That's my 2 cents."
920,It s the first time i bother to write a review about a movie....but i m so disappointed that i have to say some things....i saw the movie having the highest expectations as a marvel fan and after the infinity war which was a masterpiece.....this movie was a DISASTER...i really felt bored...no action...silly jokes and favorite characters that in all previous marvel movies were strong and fighters now they were like random guest stars...i don t understand why the plot had to ruin thor hulk and thanos...i left the cinema with my friends and we were all disappointed....i really don t understand how everybody says this is a PERFECTION.....marvel has given us really great movies....unfortunately that was not one of them...
921,"After the pretty decent Infinity War, here is this one. What a disappointment! While Thanos is supposed to fight with Eternity, Order, Chaos, the gods from Asgard, from Olympus, we see a fat ""god"" of thunder saying silly things, and some stupid time travelling arcs.Wasn't it smarter to give a call to Rama-Tut?Plus, how can the Avengers hope some victory without Norinn Radd and Warlock?This makes no sense. Plus, we got superheroes who never wear a mask, and some ridiculous shots of super-girls. We're happy to see that wearing an armor from Stark's requires no special ability or training."
922,Thanks marvel for this amazing ride and the perfect ending
923,"**Spoilers alert**Boring and slow at the start.The writing wasn't great. Come on, using time travel to fix everything. Iron took literally no time at all to ""figure out the chaotic of the quantum realm"". Thanos had the gauntlet, becomes a god, yet he could not foresee the future (that they will go back in time?) come on, he had the time stone.Captain marvel was in the movie for like 5 minutes...Captain america is so OP at the end.Need to have less of Captain America and Iron man, they are boring characters with the same hate/love relationship. Needed more scene of Thor and Hulk (these two really lighten up the mood of the movie).The army battle at the end was over the top and had really no purpose. Who needs an army when you have Thor + Hulk + Captain marvel. Captain Marvel took no effort at all taking out their mother ship.Thanos, a character who is patience and always prepare/plan ahead yet he wanted to start a fight with the avengers from the future. He had no stones (just a weapon) and he fought head on with the avengers who already gather all the stones. Why risk it? Yes some would argue that he was over confident and that he thought none of the Avengers can use the gauntlet (they have a Hulk and Thor!). Thanos should have just waited till they return the stones...then take the stones then. Or he could have stop the future avengers from gathering the stones in the first place. Just bad writing.And the ending, come on, Captain America manages to find and live through the same timeline and meeting up with the future Bucky and Falcon (what is the chance of this? 1 in 14 millions? The writers set rules for time travel, yet they end it like this. Just really unbelievable.Most people I spoke to said they enjoyed the movie for the fun of it. They liked the action...etc. Yet when I asked them did the movie make sense? Most of them replied ""no"" or ""kinda"".I felt they were trying to do too much and in the process left people like me wondering...""that made no sense..."""
924,"What's up with the time travel?
""The OA"" also dig into this kind of multiverse travel, but clearly they did it better and try their best not to put tons of plot holes into their film, but clearly the director of Endgame decided to ignore it. Seems like their fan base forgot their brain when they watch this too based on the ridiculously high rating of this movie."
925,"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!"
926,"So it all ends. I have loved most of the MCU, some have been too predictable but I awaited after IW to see how it would all pan out. Firstly some of my favourite characters are a joke. Please don't dumb Thor or Banner/Hulk down, not necessary. Great starting scene, then slow dramatic next 1.5 hours. It builds to the time travel reversing all section with too many plot holes. We've all seen other time reversing movies who have done it so much better. The last hour is spectacular, great to see all the gang back but it feels rushed. Emotion runs high and defo not a kids film in my eyes. Cap is great Stark is amazing but everyone else feels like there just there. What I loved was the beauty of the final scenes, wonderful score and saying goodbye to old friends. Overall wanted more, but even far from perfect is still pretty good."
927,"Well, was hyped to the max for this movie but in the end, Avengers Endgame was as bad as its name and was the worst Avengers movie. Story was disconnected and dialogues were cliche. Thanos and Avengers doing hand to hand combat was beyond ridiculous.Utmost focus on Cap and Iron Man. Unimaginable nerfing of Thanos, Thor and Hulk. Time travel was handled extremely badly. Humor was overused and movie felt like Gotg-3. Power of Avengers and Thanos was not visualized properly and battle/fight scenes felt bland. I need to re-watch Infinity War to forget this abomination."
928,"Infinity war was amazing... this... nope. Hollyweird just doesn't know how to finish a story anymore. Paint by numbers and submit to a committee. Was it bad? No. Was it good? No.
Robert Downey Junior is the only good thing in this film."
929,I'm sorry but this movie was boring except for the last part. Infinity war was well balanced and every character had a role. Also had action from beginning to end. But endgame mostly had unnecessary talks or travelling here and there. Most main characters don't even have any fight scenes. Whole movie is focused on only 2-3 characters. Rest of the characters were in it like they just have a cameo. Should have made a semi team up film after infinity war and then Endgame with all the characters having enough screentime. Wasted opportunity.
930,One of the best superhero movies. But didn't like it as much as Infinity War or Dark Phoenix.
931,"Unbelievable and forced moments littered throughout. From a rat that magically lets ant-man out who happens to put the whole story in motion to Thor being turned into a weak and badly CgI'd overweight character to Captain America yielding Thor's hammer and his only reaction being ""I knew it"", a cringeworthy girl power scene and cheesy one liners.... I started checking my watch an hour in. Terribly disappointing, it felt more like DC than Marvel. I don't understand how people thought this was good!"
932,"Simple movie and weird.
End Game? Seriously? Looks like how "" End"" //"
933,Stan Lee is rolling in his grave what a horrible movie.Longtime comic collector and marvel enthusiast have just made my life easier. I will never be watching a marvel movie again.
934,Complete feminists movie. Several male hero characters were belittled and turned into abysmal failures. Waste of time and money.
935,"Really disappointed after watching it yesterday. Unnecessarily long, very boring finish to a series of movies with a lot of peaks (Ragnarock, GotG, CaptA) and quite a few troughs (AoU, Iron Man generally, Black Panther) but I thought this was a new low. Really poor writing, idiotic plot holes and stupid action scenes. Really sad end.. felt like flogging a dead horse, shame to go out like this."
936,I can't describe my disappointment. The movie was very boring with predictable happy end.
937,"I'm a huge marvel fan, and my biggest issue with this movie was how they treated Captain America. In the end he goes back in time to live his life with Peggy. Some saw this as romantic, the ending he deserved.I saw it as throwing away the years of growth we've seen this character go through to move on and be happy in the future. The film makers got scared and played the easy way out -- by sending him back in time. Not even touching down upon the time travel issues by having him live out his time along with a second Steve, did they really have Steve Rogers completely abandon his best friends for a girl he liked for two weeks?The ending of his character shocked and disappointed me. My review will probably be taken down, but hey. Maybe someone will see this."
938,"I'd give this movie a 6/10 at best - it's a mindless action movie trying to be more and people seeing it as more.There's amazing CGI, and when you throw in countless superheros any cliche makes your ""hair stand up"". But for me, this entire film revolved around one-liner comedy in place of character development, and what it's known for best... mindless action.The action doesn't even have to make sense, like Thanos magically 1v5'ing with no infinity stones when in the previous film had issues 1v1'ing with stones. The entire movie is ""hype"" revolving around a ridiculous time ""heist"". They even made jokes about how stupid the idea is, and in 30 seconds Iron Man figures it out.This entire movies is cliches, re-used tropes, and one-liners used by familiar actors and amazing CGI. If that's all it takes to be great, good for you!"
939,"I think giving this film a 2 was being kind. Iv rarely been so excited to watch a film and to say I feel let down is an understatement. It's hard to know where to start as theres so many flaws in this film. The film feels rushed which is unbelievable for a film that's 3hours long but you could of fit the first hour and half in 10minutes. I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing, the film was that boring. The whole time travel is just a complete mess and how easy were the avengers able to get all the stones, that was a joke. In regards to the battle at the end it was ok but it's almost like the writers wanted it to be this big iconic battle that people would be talking about for years but that fell flat too. This films been 10 years in the waiting and 21 films later and to end like that was just poor...So poor."
940,Very bad movie just waste of time and money. in the first two hours of the movie nothing happen.
941,"The hype that was built and created totally overshadowed the movie, and came in very subpar. Even on a technical side of things parts of the movie felt rushed, not needed, useless or not thought out at all."
942,"There is some amazing cgi in this movie but the feeling of ever smouldering ""I'm going to be a hero"" look soon betrayed the shallowness of this epic ""all for one, one for all"" nonsense.
A score that does not deliver and the utter nonsense logic of ""time interference"" really lost my suspension of disbelief.
I adored the last Thor movie but Holding out for Too many Heroes proved too shallow and nowhere near as Compelling as ""LOTR - Return of the King""."
943,"I thought the 3 hours went fast. It was generally a good movie but it wasn't fantastic. It was just good but with lots and lots of plot holes.1. Tony Stark becomes a time travel master in a short period of time with only ONE test iteration ran (which was successful). You folks do realise that Tony Stark had taken many test runs to even get his Iron Man core to work?2. Captain Marvel finding Ironman in space amidst a universe full of ""aliens"" that she needs to help probably sending out distress calls of their own.3. The absence of Loki after everyone comes back.4. How did Ironman snatch the infinity stones off Thanos?!!! You saw how much power was coming out of those things as the stones get sucked into his glove sockets. Even Quill holding 1 power stone (and remember, he is a semi/demi god?) caused a problem.5. With Pimm back, and with the knowledge stored in Stark's database, it means the MCU (and its bad guys who will do everything in their power to get hold of it) can now travel back and forth into time at will. Especially for Antman and the Wasp. This is opening Pandora's box for the future of MCU. Perhaps Pimm in his infinite wisdom will ensure this does not fall into the wrong hands?6. Dr Strange and the Ancient One see the infinity stones as critical in protecting the universe from the malevolent dark one which Strange fought in his movie. So when Thanos destroys the stones after his click, the world should not just be trying to get back to normal after 5 years. It should be destroyed.These are my top plot holes that keep gnawing at me. The movie was entertaining but the storyline chosen was full of flaws."
944,"A film with a great closure but that does not surpass its predecessor in terms of quality refers to it, although it is true that we should not let go of fanaticism the film is good but it is not to be considered a jewel or that it is above several cult movies"
945,"It was just amazing! Incredible, epic, emotional, action-packed and awesome! I wonder how it will all go on after this... Not since the wnd of Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings have I been so excited for an ending saga. I can't wait for what is next. An all female Avengers? Hopefully!"
946,"Let me start I'm a big fan of marvel so there is no biased against them.
This movie is a big pile of trash. Don't give them your hard earn cash like I did, wish I could take back 3 hours of my life.
Director thinks we watch superheroes movies looking for oscar winning performances.
2hours of nonsense time travel talk, about 15min action and than more nonsense pushing agenda #metoomovement?. I thought about walking out several times.Rubbish."
947,"Overrated, 2 boring hours and 1 hour fighting. A movie that depends on the effects only"
948,"1.Captain America is the new king of Asgard, god of lightning
2. No fight scene with hulk
3.Time travel is a mess
4. I have other 1000 questions"
949,"The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.I have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this ""closure"" to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history."
950,"Too long, too boring, too many special effects versus substance.
Bad jokes Don't don't waste your money or time."
951,"Other reviews have added what a hot mess this is. I have a theory that resorting to use time-travel as a fix-all is nothing more than a lazy way out. It proved so here for sure. The holes in the time-travel portion of the plot are big enough to drive a Mack Truck thru.And it gets worse the more you ponder it. Hulk as wimp? Thor as a fat couch potato? And Captain Marvel... She's hinted to be the savior all during the credits of Infinity War then makes little more than a cameo appearance in End Game.The movie did succeed as a way to get Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson and Robert Downey Jr. out of the MCU going forward. Bravo, we didn't need 3 hours for that.After waiting 15 minutes for a post-credit scene and getting nada, I felt that kinda summed up the whole movie."
952,"This movie is everything I ever wanted, and even more!Beginning of this movie was shocking and brave, killing of that evil purple guy Thanos at the very beginning. Very cool...Making Thor fat and depressed, without any development throughout the movie, and watching all people in the audience laughing at him made me really sad, being fat, worthless and depressing slog of a man myself, people made fun of me too! Finally, I had someone to identify myself to. FINALLY!!!Time travel part of plot was, should I say, very cool, and reminded me of many other great movies with time travel. I didn't expected them to go in that direction! That part made the plot of this movie very complex, I didn't get the part with captain america at the end, but I clapped and cried with the rest of the ladies in theater because it was a perfect ending for that sweet man, leaving his friends and world's needs to finally get laid.Iron man and Natasha dying was a bold choice, i cried and clapped in those moments. Oh, I clapped when Cap lift Thors hammer too, and learned how to use it immediately, oh what a perfect fan service.This movie was little slow, sometimes little boring, but boy oh boy did it pulled off in that insane third act! That was so FUN! I mean movies should always be fun, right? Not to mention that IMPORTANT girl power moment, with every super girl superhero in one shot, a real cheer leading moment!In short, PERFECTION!"
953,"Following last year's Infinity War we are given free tickets to ride the emotional roller-coaster. I don't think I have experienced so many goosebumpy moments in one movie before which I am sure all of the Marvel fans will agree with.Of course, due to this being the end of an era it is going to be emotional but what else does the movie have going for it?High quality performances? Of course! Starting with the heart of the Marvel movies, Robert Downey Jr (Iron Man/Tony Stark) I think stood out above all. This is all down to the MCU being kicked off with RDJ and then the final snap ending with him. 21 movies building up to this and it was totally smashed by RDJ with a performance that I think deserves an Oscar nomination. It was gripping and you really felt everything he was feeling as it was conveyed so well. So much so that I had a tear in my eye when Spiderman (Tom Holland) returned and it even had me sobbing at the very end with his death and at his funeral. Top that with all of those people the character had an impact on throughout the movies and you get a really heart wrenching moment. Let's not forget about the performances from others as at no point did I feel anyone was slacking during this film. The young Tom Holland was most definitely impressive but Chris Hemsworth really did show how good of an actor he is in this movie. I feel like he doesn't get as much credit as he should in terms of the performances he gives.In terms of the story I feel as if the wait from the last movie (Infinity War) was definitely worth it. I especially liked that it took its time and wasn't just mindless combat the whole way through. I believe it really help the characters develop even more, obviously some more than others. An example of this would be Hawkeye, where as before you knew he had a family and he was the sort of 'dad' of the Avengers. This time it really shows what means the most to the character and what he is willing to do for what he cares about most. Also Jeremy Renners performance as Hawkeye in this movie was most certainly his best so far. Towards the end of the movie during the combat sequences I was amazed. From Captain America wielding Mjolnir all the way to the the infamous leader finally saying ""Avengers Assemble"". I just feel like everything I wanted to happen, happened. All of the characters came together well and there was even a woman power moment to keep everyone happy, in my opinion I don't know what else could be added!In terms of the special effects it was definitely almost perfect and it helped set the scene. The only flaw that stood out to me was when the characters came through the portal from Titan, the green screen shot seemed to stand out like a sore thumb. Other than that, with all those characters and entities on screen at once that need to be computer generate I think it was incredibly well made and I really give a round of applause to everyone that worked on this movie. A special round of applause goes to the Russo brothers for making something so special and astonishing.I think this is definitely the best movie so far in the MCU, a movie that will be difficult to trump. What am I looking forward to in the upcoming phase? Roll on Spiderman Far From Home and the Black Widow prequel movie!"
954,"Last 30 minutes was overly sentimental, however, there were some scenes that made me have goose bumps. It was not what I expected."
955,"This movie was the biggest let down and anti climax of all time, I am one of the true marvel fans having grown up with the comics and watching all the big and small screen adaptations however this movie had the hype and potential to be the biggest greatest movie of all time , it wasn't it was rubbish !! And a joke , I felt so strongly about this i created this account just to write a review on this horrible movie . I won't spoil it but it was a rip off and a cheat infinity war was amazing 10/10 but endgame is 1/10 also just to rub salt into the wound there is no end credit cut scene so don't waste your time.... you are welcome,I can't believe the money this movie will make and it isn't even any good"
956,"So a handful of heroes fight all the way to the climactic end of the movie, and then they lose the chance to finish what they started. I am not going to spoil it, but watching a million CGI characters appear on both sides was like letting all the air out of the tires. All the dramatic build-up was lost when it became a billions against billions battle.Which brings up the fact that at least 90 minutes of this movie is spent on boring scenes of various Avengers feeling depressed about the death of the heroes, and going to support group meetings. We get it. The Avengers are depressed. This could have been covered in fifteen minutes or less in a group meeting. We did not need to follow each Avenger through their depressing trip down memory lane. Thank God Ant Man came back from the quantum universe and got the ball rolling!!Unfortunately, Thor becomes the punchline for jokes throughout the movie. Since Captain Marvel is the new #1 hero, they had to power down Thor by turning him into a drunken hobo. The Incredible Hulk has spent the past three movies (Thor Ragnarok, Infinity War, & this one) in permanent erectile dysfunction, and he continues to be a zero in this movie. Thor and the Hulk are just here to be the focus of comedy as has-beens. Even Bruce Banner as a scientist gets slapped down. Michael Douglas and the Pym Particles have to fix what Bruce Banner fails to do. It is a very sad way for two of Marvel's earliest and most powerful heroes to end their game.There are a lot of good moments in Endgame. Most of them happen when the small crew of Avengers is trying to find the original gems. Then the battle when it is just the small group against Thanos is excellent. It was building up to a great ending, Captain America & Iron Man defeating Thanos, against all odds. Even Thor was redeeming himself in the battle! That is how this Marvel Comics masterpiece could have ended. But they had to throw in the billions of CGI characters and turn it into a big circus act... Too bad. Less was more."
957,"Expected a lot more honestly. Infinity War was way better. After they make out the plan, everything is predictable."
958,Feeling cheated after watching the movie at high rate ticket. nothing new same action. worst movie of avengers series.
959,"Had a lot of expectations. But everything fizzled out. Wanted it to end after interval but friends, huh.They made the mockery of Hulk, Thor and Doctor Strange. They are damn powerful in the comic folklore but the movie ruined everything.Pro- Captain America got the limelight and am happy about that.The execution of women empowerment was not that great. Then the mantle of captain america was passed on to different character. Good that the society is learning but it should not be the case of getting money from all the sections by showing off/or what you don't have faith in.Guardians of the galaxy is far better than this. I am disappointed."
960,It seems fanboys will be fanboys forever and always. Endgame is much like the original film highly predictable. Perhaps I have seen too many movies and am familiar with common plot devices. The moment Tony refused too help beings he had a child and couldn't risk it I knew instantly he would die in the end. Overall it wasn't terrible but I believe the 2nd and 3rd films in the series were better with only the first being worse. If this movie made you cry you have never felt true sadness.
961,The strory was going nowhere and killing the thanos we loved and replacing him with one we didnt care about was a bad move
962,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it."
963,"It was underwhelming. I guess I had expectations for it, some people hyped it up too much. Infinity was better."
964,"Had high expectations for this movie, but is was the worst =("
965,"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!"
966,The movie picks storyline at its own convenience. Impossible things become possible at the noise orchestra. My biggest complain is that there is no coherence especially how do you quantity powers of these super heroes ? Just hit smash and do it all over again.
967,"The 3rd act was the most EPIC moment in the MCU by far. You kinda have to watch the other MCU movies to really enjoy it, so if you haven't watched any MCU movie yet, now it's the time."
968,"It was suppose to be the most anticipating movie for any marvel fans after waiting for over a decade, but alas the story line was just repeating itself, rather lets just call it Avengers: Endgame repeated stories from the past films!
time travel was another huge disappointment! shows real lazy writing, screen cast etc! there are more than 14 million ways the screenwriter and director could have made it different!
a few punch lines and the end fight was only worth the money spent for watching it!
as a whole i would just say sorry marvel you just lost it ! please don't bring back anymore of your films!
you just lost a huge fan after watching this crap!
sayonara Marvel, and i hope nobody watches your upcoming stupid spider-boy with a dumb brain!"
969,I mean come on. Is this actually the best movie you've seen? How is this messy movie better than Guardians 1 or Winter Soldier? This movie shouldn't definitely even be in the top 50 on IMBD.
970,"Far too long and uninteresting. No character development. Pacing between large battles and dialogues way off, making both of them equally boring and drawn out."
971,"This is my first time to review a movie ! , who end the marvel universe like this ?
they should have gone for infinity war as an end for the 11 years !
I mean the movie was too much rush ! first of all they made infinity gauntlet like it's some kids toys even though earlier in the movies they said it's super hard to done.
time travel thing ? was pushed into the movie in complicated fast way .
and they disrespected thor ! one of the toughest avengers ! and had a center role in infinity war , they made him fat and drunky guy which no one listened to and take him for serious !
and hulk ? they destroyed him too in the movie !
and since when a human being can carry or hold an infinty stone !
sooo much gaps and plot holes !
i watched all marvel films and infinity war was amazing ! i thought it was the prequel to the final epic ending ! after seeing endgame , my opinion ? they should've stopped at infinity war ! it would been have the greatest ending !"
972,"The film was ok, but i don't see Marvel in it.
I see frustrations, unanswered questions, heroes ""unavailable"" and heroes ""unused"".
I enjoyed it, but i went in with too many expectations.
And in the end i can only say: ""Plot holes ftw"""
973,""" ...the problem is, when you mess with time, time kinda tends to MESS BACK.. ""

974,"I have every Marvel movie, but this one makes me want to sell my entire collection. This movie starts off good enough. You see Stark and Nebula drifting along in space, and the remainder of the oxygen is running out. Then a bright light forms and Tony opens his eyes, and there you see Captain Marvel. She saves Tony and Nebula by bringing them to earth.Now you would think this movie is now going to get really good, but no. Instead Tony points out it is basically hopeless to try and fight Thanos. Then it pushes the story 5 years in the future. Black Widow is in charge in keeping communication open between the heroes. In the meantime, the writers make up obscure BS to keep one of the most powerful heroes away, aka Captain Marvel, while throwing in what-ifs story lines on how to bring everyone back.Basically, the team consists of Black Widow, Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America, War Machine, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, Nebula, Rocket, and Thor. So, no you don't see Captain Marvel at all. It's like the writers wanted you to cringe, but no there is more cringe worthy BS they include in this movie. The one that you will notice right away is the typical ""woman in the refrigerator"" plot twist. This is when the writers sacrifices the female character to empower her male counterparts, which has been done tirelessly countless times before.You know I'm not even a big fan of Widow, but COME ON! They did the biggest disservice to Black Widow, and to her fan base. She basically does nothing the entire movie and then sacrifices herself for the soul stone. Then the whole male cast sighs in sadness and pushes harder to finish the job. To top it off they attempt the whole female cast rally to help Spider-man, which fails. Then to really hit it home that female characters are worthless, they barely mention the sacrifice Black Widow did for them to get the soul stone. Instead though the entire end of the movie is about Tony Stark's funeral.Here's a suggestion wait until it comes out on blu-ray. It was an utter waste of money to watch it in theaters. Also, way to go Marvel for screwing over female characters yet again! 10 years and 22 movies, and you still can't get it right! Oh by the way only 1 female lead super hero movie!"
975,"To be honest, most of the people i talked to about this movie said that endgame was great, fantastic or incredible. None of these people could have answered the question: ""why is this a good movie?"".
In the half of the playtime i was bored and already wondering, that they needed another hour and a half to tell the story behind this.
I don' t want to spoiler anything and i'll remain quiet until the movie's airing is completed. But once you have seen it, please try to answer this simple question: ""why was this a good movie to you?"""
976,"I don't even know where to begin writting this review. There's so much bullshit in this movie, it's unbelievable.So, first things first. Hulk and Thor...
Starting with Hulk: One of the strongest avengers reduced to a joke. The whole merge of Hulk and Banner was one of the most boring things I've ever seen, and it did nothing for the movie plot.Thor...now this one really was the WORST. They did him so dirty! We go from Ragnarok and Infinity War Thor, a more mature character who was powerful enough to almost defeat Thanos when he had the infinity stones to drunk Santa Claus, that can't even defeat Thanos without the infinity stones even though he had both Mjölnir and Stormbreaker....that was a huge plot whole. His character was reduced to a joke for comedic purposes BUT IT WASN'T EVEN FUNNY.And Cap, Well i havo no problem with his character at all but him being able to use Mjölnir and produce lightening? Nah...way too forced. Cap shouldn't be able to control Thunder.Also, plot wholes were just stupid... Them going back in time is already bad enough, but there were so many plot wholes... Why didn't Nebula die when she killed her past self? Where was Vision and how did they get his stone? Why wasn't Loki there if they went back in time? People keep saying it was because Thanos killed him before the stones but they went back in time before Ragnarok, soThanos never got to Thor's ship!
How come Banner struggled so much snapping his fingers but Tony just did it right away?The scene where Natasha died was also mehh, it should have been her and Banner (not the merge, just Banner) we would get closure from those two, and a it would have been way more emotional than what it was. If they kept Banner's struggle to make Hulk ''appear'' that would have been a good way to make Hulk finally come back angrier than ever and fight like he's supposed to..
And finally the epic final battle was totally forgeatable... it lacked power, lacked that emotion thor gave us in infinity war when he got stormbreaker. Lacked powerful soundtracks to go with the flow of the scenes....lacked a lot of things."
977,"Just too long with too many characters each having on average 10 minutes of screen time. Plot meanders between past (5 years supposedly but even more in one or two scenes quite contrary to expectation) and present with tongue in cheek nod to titles of movies made previously about time travel (back to the future etc). The physics behind time travel is given a pat explanation with the audience expected to swallow some line about how the nature of time changes at the quantum level.
Why is time travel a big deal in this movie? Because mostly everything that is done in the last Avengers film is reversed (with the loss of only a couple of main characters this time around) and Marvel fans can look forward to seeing more of their favorite action heroes in the future. To me, the entire plot is a cop out. Going by this some further plot twist in the next Marvel movie will see the revival of the characters who die in this film.
The acting is mediocre with many of the main characters hamming it up as if on a vacation especially Hemsworth as Thor.
The critics love this movie and it's a global smash hit. To be fair i'm not part of that demographic that is sold on superheroes but I did enjoy black panther and the first Thor film. But this film is about 60-70 minutes too long and can be a strain on the nerves."
978,"The MCU's long goodbye to the Avengers comes off as truly epic and thunderously exciting.they have somehow brought 10 years of story and character to a natural, satisfying conclusion
Well Done 👏🏽 👏🏽 👏🏽"
979,A thriller story following the continuation of infinity war . We a introduced to a new avenger who just might be the strongest yet.This is the end game
980,"Captain America can still come back to the body age we remember as Chris Evans, even though he went back in time and started again in his life with Peggy Carter and naturally aged! With using the quantum tunnel and suit, set in a experiment by the Hulk, it worked with Scott Lang, who became a old man and a child!"
981,"Loved the movies very much but just confused at only one point.
How did Captain America went into past to place the stone back and came back as an old man, when he went back in time he still had Captain America's power so he can't age."
982,"The storyline being absolutely terrible is almost unrepairable. However, they do try and fail. The bjg problem is it's finally clear the choppiness and flow are off due secrecy and too much outsourcing. In order to obacure the plot, different companies are awarded different CGI scenes without ever being told the whole enchilada so that they can't leak anything... Of course this method requires there to be a very strong movie plot to begin with or you end up with chop suey. This movie has a few moments of good laughs and one liners... And that's it. It's a total and complete failure."
983,None of the rules presented in movie makes sense. Bad movie in regards to final conclusion
984,"Are you kidding me? I have been waiting years for this movie and they make it for young children. If you're so sensitive for your child wait until it comes out so you can watch it with it rather than complain at the movies. I'm also not impressed with Tony and Natasha's death why does Captain America get to just live his story has been told. I think Tony deserves retirement with his family. Natasha's death could've been a little better. Captain America could've taken it or one of the stronger avengers for the huge sacrifice, but no Tony has to do everything. Couldn't they just use the quantum realm to help them get him back so he could retire?? Come on marvel I know this couldn't be rushed but couldnt the characters get what they deserve?"
985,Really? Time travel is how you save the world and bring back half of it?
986,"What happens when every one of the millionth characters pretend to be important? They're all plain flat.Felt for 3 hours that my job was taking care of the cctv of the busiest Black Friday store, where a huge crowd fight for nothing and eventually someone gets something of value.Dr Strange creates the cheese holes out of the blue to fight Thanos... pathetic reaction of the audience seeing Black Panther come into action.... predictable and pointless. Effectist, I'm sure. A movie for hopeless generations needing to be represented by a super-tag.Once the dream was to have super powers, fly, move things, you name it.Not it is to feel represented by the person who does it. Enter Black Panther and Captain Marvel.Marcel studios monetising on social movements. How lame is your life to need that representation in an action movie? It's a story of them, not a story of you!I saw a long cctv recording."
987,"I swear this movie is the worst thing i've ever seen of my life. Marvel, it's over for me"
988,"3 hours long with 30 minutes of action, and all that action coming at the end so it's basically a 2 hr long drama with a pathetic final battle.This movie could of been 1 hr 30 max but they decide to drag on all the conversations that are all pointless anyway, Hawkeye gets more screen time then basically anyone and who cares anyway.They destroyed hulk and made him and Thor a complete joke, overpowered captain America and this movie should of just been called iron man 4Hulk dabbing and Thor playing fornite just came across as try hard and I can't believe how boring an avengers movie could be.Such hype for such a let down, anyone who reviews this movie as a 10 has absolutely no idea, how can this movie be a 10 it absolutely bores you for 2 hours then throws in some trash 30 mins at the end which is mostly Hawkeye and captain America fighting anyway which are 2 of the weakest characters and Thanos beats everyone so easily with no stones while hulk almost drowns from nothing lolThis movie was an absolute joke I hope Russo brothers don't make another marvel movie because this was an absolute boring peice of crap and they are destroying hulk and Thor"
989,"I Invested The Last 8-9 Years in MCU Marvel Movies & TV Shows... Its Not ""All Connected"" This Was No ""Culmination Of the Entire MCU""Critical Parts Cut out of the Movie....First Half Was Utterly Dull & Boring...Turned Many Characters & Their Stotylines Into a Disgrace...Plenty Of Out of Place Jokes ...The Colours Were Awful...The Final Battle Deserves My One & Only Star...However That Final Battle Payoff Was Clearly Rushed & Felt Underwhelming... Just As i was Starting to Enjoy itI Hope the Blu-Ray / Digital Release Is An Extended Version & Shows More Focus On Other Characters..."
990,"I usually do not watch movies twice in such a short amount of time. But after I did the Double Feature (at the Midnight premiere) with Infinity War almost 2 weeks ago, I re-watched Endgame yesterday and it was as amazing as my first impression of it was! And while I will not spoil anything about Endgame, I will talk about things Infinity War! So if you have not seen that yet, do not blame me for anything revealed here.My summary is a pop culture reference and there are quite a few in the Marvel movies, hinting at other franchises (Alien got name checked for example in Infinity War and even ""copied"" or ""homaged"" if you will and there are a few in Endgame too). But those little digs are not too important, they are just nice touches for those who know them. Having an understanding of the MCU as a whole, from Phase 1 to now Phase 3 is way more important. And as someone who is not too familiar with the comics myself, I can tell you that knowing the movies is enough to enjoy the franchise.Still you can google the other stuff or even make your own conclusions. Now that is a lot of foreword and I haven't even gotten one word about Endgame. But as I said above, no spoilers here. What we do know (from the trailers) is the beginning. But whatever we saw and thought we knew - what happens not even half an hour into the movie, will rattle you. Now what?Yes the first hour of the movie is ""slow"", but it had to be. There are ramifications after the snap and the characters we learned to love, that we have close to our heart, have been torn apart. Quite literally gone with the wind - everyone is thinking how is this going to be resolved (no pun intended)? And the movie will give you answers, and will even try to sort of explain things that are quite - unexplainable.And while there is full on drama, there is still a lot of humor. The movie takes beloved characters and does things to them - or rather the weight of what happened does things to them. What exactly? Well that would be telling, but let me tell you some very bold choices have been made. And if you are not emotional at least during some scenes, you are taking away a lot of fun for yourself.I can be a cynic too at times, but taking this apart (which you can do with every movie), is only hurting your own viewing pleasure. There is so much love in this, for the characters, for details, for the fans - it's just a rollercoaster and I'm not afraid to say that I shed a couple of tears. It is after all tying knots and bringing certain things to a conclusion.That doesn't mean there isn't anything more coming (because we know there is, next up Spiderman as an in between movie before Infinity War?). And there are some familiar faces coming back to Endgame from other movies that we haven't seen in a while but also new cameos like Ken Jeong. I'm guessing there will be a deleted scene with him, his scene seems to short for storytelling purposes I reckon.Epic fights, epic emotions and dialog that is hinting at things to come later in the movie ... which you will see even clearer with repeat viewing(s) ... The Russos did it - Kudos to them, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee (RIP) and everyone else involved in this of courseEdit: Endgame works even for people who have not seen a single MCU movie yet (confirmed by a friend of mine). But of course the gravitas and the conclusions of everything will work way better if you have seen the rest of the movies. Also let me add that this is ""technically sound"" as some would put it - or just plain great visually speaking. But I reckon this is a given anyway. Popcorn (or Nachos or whatever you prefer) to perfection"
991,"Do not watch this film unless you are a Marvel die hard fan or you want to fall asleep. Contains 3 hours of boring sentimental dialogues, 1 fighting scene and makes infinity war look like Space Odyssey. Waste of time."
992,"Why is this 3 hours movie..If we talk or heard about super hero movie, only action and adventures comes in our mind.. Also Avengers get successful in box office because of action part not bcoz of storyline..after watching 3 hours I feel like I should ask for refund..what a horrible movie.."
993,"This movie was TERRIBLE. First off there was NO reason for the movie to be three to four hours long... I think that was part of the strategy honestly make you think its so epic it had to be a nearly 4 hour movie.90% of the movie is just acting, trying to figure out getting the team back together, or undoing what has been done. Outside of one little battle at the end there is virtually no action in the movie at all. Additionally the action you've seen has already been seen in other movies.This is a franchise that does indeed need a complete reboot. This movie shows you how old and tired it really is. People will see it because they want to see how things end and honestly I have to give credit to the powers that be here... unlike DC they have slow cooked this movie over a decade.Iron Man is making his what 100th appearance LOL.This movie is going to be shoveled tons of money because of over hype, and because apparently its the end of the road for this group of actors.I must say however I'd hate to see anyone else playing Thor and again I'd like to see more Thor movies but that's about it.Scrub out the hype, and the franchise and tell me honestly was this movie a GREAT stand alone film? NOPE!They stretched this thing out for every single dollar. Nothing new to see here I'd skip even though you wont."
994,How can people give this film anymore than one star! Infinity war was amazing and set up such a good story then this guff appeared in our screens! Sickening political correctness moments! What was the point of hyping captain marvel for her to be in this for 5 minutes! Ruined the hulk character! Best character by far was happy who had the best scene in the movie!
995,"I'm a picky person and when you attempt to cram everything from the comic in to am movie it becomes logical as to why they changed so much.I don't like change unless it improves something. It is inefficient to change things and not have them improve the outcome.I thought some of the action scenes were good and yes, I shed a tear when so-and-so died, but meh, too many people, too many deus ex machina and sloppy writing makes everything else seem tarnished.And they could have done with less.I originally gave 3 stars but I bumped it to 4 for making me feel sad when I said I wouldn't."
996,To tell the truth the movie was meh. It made little to no sense and was severely over hyped. I only watched it for Thor. Who both marvel and the other characters made fun of.
997,"First of all - this movie had to be brilliant to back up all the hype and legacy from earlier films. So is it brilliant? No, it's not even close.Second of all - Endgame just isn't a very good movie in any noteworthy sense, outside of effects and really good action scenes. And this brings me back to my first point. Perhaps this formula would work during the rise of comic films, but I can't see this film as anything but a huge disappointment.After a brutally emotional opening scene, that I have to admit - is really good, Endgame then proceeds to jump from scene to scene with inconsistent tone, pace, and development. A serious movie can have great humor, but the way Endgame uses slapstick humor, and non-serious characters is, well - silly. Is this a serious movie or not? Many of the films rules or conventions are openly broken to serve secondary storylines, and much of the 'science' is just plain dumb. I can suspend disbelief and get into stylized movies, but so much of this movie just comes off shallow and not really well thought out.This includes the story arc that to me has little natural flow. Many comic movies today seem to come off more as bad, incomplete TV episodes that rely on being part of a series for relevance. Movies should never be like that, and Endgame felt to me like three TV episodes jammed together, with three to five tac-on false endings.While I really liked many of the action scenes, which are clearly well conceived and beautiful to watch - at this point action scenes should be a given, and the story should have the same excellence. I don't feel like I'm being to picky when great movies in the Marvel universe exist (Dr. Strange for instance). I don't consider Infinity War one of them, but it's a heck of a lot better than Endgame.To me, outside of the opening scene, all the emotional moments fall absolutely flat. Considering the conclusion of Infinity War - there is a blatantly obvious sequence that should exude the epitome of joy. This part of the movie is hard to explain without giving spoilers, but in my opinion - this sequence is the writers biggest failure of the movie. The reunions are not well executed.Objectively, this movie probably deserves a 6 for production values, great action, and resolving the Infinity War outcome. But subjectively? I really thought this movie kinda sucked."
998,"They should have called it Captain America: end game
Every scene is oriented to that useless character"
999,"Disney's grand attempt cash grab, trying to kill off characters while pandering to fan theories on who should live. Movie doesn't deserve a high rating because it is not theatrically complex. Time travel is a terrible cop-out for a real plot device."
1000,"Seriously don't believe the 9.1 score and give the movie any more money.
Movie was a horrible mess.
Aweful attempt at oscar performance. 2hours of talking about nothing. Hardly any action.
Time travel nonsense."
1001,"My expectations are not above the infinity war, but movie was sucks in many ways, first storytelling was complex, if rat didn't enter microbus, movie wouldn't exist, directors ruined thor(fathor), also we didn't see hulk and black widow's fighting scene, strange played water, thanos became classic villain after infinity war, he was extremely nerfed too, there was only two emotional scenes, last fight was garbage, it's like directors told all performers '' let's join the fight scene concurrently '' fight scene was same with Aquaman movie, only war in Aquaman happened in water"
1002,"Infinity War is a Masterpiece and there is no comparison between IW and Endgame more like EndLame.
This movie is full of plotholes , poorly written dramatic scenes and not so funny funny scenes.
Why does Ironman has to die , why he had to wear the gauntlet to snap Thanos when they were going to beat Thanos anyway. Fat thor, useless Hulk, ant-man , captain marvel, hawkeye, captain America , black panther, doctor strange, spiderman , Ironman etc all were there. There was no need of that end snap. I know they wanted to give Iron man a farewell but in a satisfying way, in movie it felt like it was totally useless. And what about Hulk and thanos encounter , oh yeah there wasn't one. I was waiting for proffessor Hulk to step up to Thanos , another disappointment.
Many people liked the last interaction between Hawkeye and Black widow but personally found it cringy and over dramatic with lame writing.
In IW you can clearly see every character was given their share of screen time and justified roles but Endgame was mess .
I have watched IW in theatres 4 times plus many times at home and i would still watch it and enjoy but Endgame i can't.
Many stupid fanboys and casual watchers might find this movie good but the people who likes things making sense and a story which takes you deep into it would feel how unsatisfying this movie is .
Even casting Brie Larson as captian marvel wasn't that bad as this movie .Last words : Infinity War wasn't the movie we deserved but It was the movie we needed.
And this movie (Endgame) is not even close to what it should be."
1003,"Most cringe worthy superhero movie I've seen.
I was eye-rolling most of the time. Near the end I was just hoping for it to finally end.
I mean, where to begin, is totally messy and nonsensical! All the time travel doesn't make sense at all.
After all the hype I'm so mad at how bad it was."
1004,Many of the 1/10 reviews or people that say infinity war is better is the people who don't understand most of what is happening or haven't seen all of the marvel films or have not read any marvel comics. Endgame is a true treat for hardcore fans such as I am as I have seen every marvel movie and have read many of the comics. It is full of satisfying scenes that have references to other marvel movies so the people that say endgame is a waste of time don't understand the references to older movies. Endgame is one of those movies where you really have to watch previous movies to find it fun. If you have not seen all or most of the marvel movies or have not read any comics you will feel bored and confused of the plot as most of the movie is fan service to marvel fans which is a 3 hour special with all characters from every marvel movie which will satisfy true marvel fans.
1005,"I have to be honest I found that this movie left me wanting is so many ways. I both liked and disliked the way the hulk progressed in it.. I mean he went from angry savage to bulked up scientist .. as a result he had very lil to contribute to the movies other then comic relief. Thor was no different.. they turned the once noble and proud warrior into a fat simpering slob. Who also was lil more then comic relief.. if that The fact is that the whole movie really could have been done with out those two characters involved really. and almost was. Their roles were both so down played as a result that I am not sure the movie goers would have missed their presence in the movie. As far as Captain America and Iron man goes I found their actions predictable. The Captain Never liked being in the future... and Tony was always looking to prove to the world that he was a true hero.. and would pay the ultimate price. I was sad to see the character die but I did see it coming.
As far as Hawkeye and Black Widow go well I would like to have seen it go the other way to be honest as I rather liked the Black Widow character.
I enjoyed the growth of the characters of both nebula and gamora..
As for all the others a great many weren't even in the movie until the last 10 or so Minutes.As for the story line.. I well I found it lacking in a major way not to mention their premise behind their use of the gems... they didn't want to lose anything gained over the years.. but at the same time bring back all those lost due to Thanos. It quite literally made zero no sense I mean its kind of impossible. Its a major paradox and the truth is Tony Stark would have know that and as a result I cant see how he or anyone else in the team that would have known that would have or could have gone along with any of it. As such a thing would have been potentially more dangerous to reality then Thanos ever was or could be."
1006,"This movie was an hour and a half too long! The first half of the movie was slow and uninteresting. It did improve as it went along but was unnecessarily long and carried on with so much non sense that was not essential to the plot.
Another example of an over hyped film doing well at the box office because of a big budget and star power. It is marginally better than the last Avengers movie but still mediocrity at its best."
1007,"What can i say that hasn't been said already? 11 years and 21 films building up to this epic finale... It was spectacular and emotional. The CGI is so good, especially on Thanos, Rocket and 'Professor Hulk', who now just blend in so good that i don't even notice it anymore. The Time Heist was great and full of funny meta jokes and do i even need to say anything about the epic final battle?
We will miss you Heimdall, Loki, Vision, Gamora, Natasha and Tony Stark...
This movie is 3000/10"
1008,"If you've watched a lot of these Marvel Cinematic Universe movies-as I have-than you probably laughed, was thrilled, and was ultimately touched by this-the pretty much final chapter of this run of the series which began with Iron Man back in '08. The fate of him as well as Captain America and a few others were great epilogues for them. Oh, and one final cameo by Marvel Comics' late creator of many of the company's popular superheroes-Stan Lee-makes it even more poignant. So to quote him, ""Excelsior!"""
1009,"First 2 hours of nothing with stupid humor just to make some children laugh and then while getting closer to the final battle... Still the same one liners to make us laugh... I won't even mention the storyline and it's plot holes... Everything in this movie is wrong...
The Endgame destroys whatever marvel was building for 12 years!!!
It's a disgrace and great disrespect to all our favorite heroes who are portrayed as a parody of themselves (Thor and Hulk especially)...
This film is clearly not made for marvel fans.. Such a shame... Because for me last year's AVENGERS film was simply the best superhero movie of all time...
The Endgame unfortunately was just a family comedy... 😠"
1010,"First, let me preface by saying I've only seen one other movie in MCU and that was Ant-Man. A friend had an extra ticket and did not want to go alone. I completely understand that there were plenty other movies that lead up to this one, but I still saw Endgame and this is the take of someone not heavily invested in MCU.The movie by itself and very cliché and boring, and I will say that without having seen the other films there is no character development to allow you build any emotional connection with any of the characters.The movie was off to a decent start with some mild humor and storyline, but nearing the last hour I lost all interest. The movie just gave into an overly long and cliché fight scene showing you how many different characters from other movies they could shove in. From there it just played out exactly as one would expect. There were a couple deaths here and there, but those characters were lost with no emotional attachment built during the film. My takeaway was relief when the credits finally rolled.If you like predictable, action movies then this is probably the movie for you. If you are not familiar with the MCU franchise, this is definitely not the place to familiarize. If you are looking for a movie with substance and takeaway, then this is also not the movie for you."
1011,"Today I saw ""Avengers: Endgame"" (2019), directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Starring Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner and many, many more. Oh man, what a cast! Just like ""Avengers: Infinity War"" (2018), I was blown away by this film. The Russo brothers have done it again! Great story, great acting, great special effects, great sets/locations, and great soundtrack. Every factor is top-notch in this movie! I am not going to spoil this movie. This is all I'm going to say about it. Is this the best superhero movie? No, there are some I personally like better. But, it's in my top 10 best Marvel movies for sure, if not top 5! Overall, the cast is extraordinary, and every character had their own shining moment. I was kind of skeptical about Paul Rudd as Ant-Man. Most of you know that I absolutely hate the Ant-Man comic book character. Nothing against Paul Rudd, but the movie version of Ant-Man is very obnoxious. I was worried he was going to ruin it with one-liners and jokes. But, to my surprise, he was not that bad. He played a critical factor in this movie, and his jokes were few and far between, and actually funny! The other characters are stellar as usual. Under the direction of the Russo Brothers, that's not surprising! That's all I'm going to say, I will not spoil the Endgame. You'll have to go see the movie to find out how good it is for yourself! Believe me, you won't be the same. If you think you know what this movie will be like from watching the trailers, you have no idea what you're in for! Props to you, Anthony and Joe Russo. You guys did a Marvel-ous job again! I look forward to other future movies with your involvement, and I hope you continue to direct other superhero movies in the future! This movie is absolutely worth the money to see it in the theater and also to buy on DVD. Obviously, I give this film a full 5 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen ""Avengers: Endgame"" yet, what are you waiting for? Go check it out if you haven't already! Remember, once you guys see it, DON'T SPOIL THE ENDGAME!""We're in the Endgame now....."""
1012,This is the best worst marvel movie i ever seen so much lag
1013,Mighty Thor becomes an obese drunkard & abdicates his throne to some chick.The once Incredible Hulk is now an inane Hybrid 1/2 man 1/2 Hulk & loses his arm.Captain Marvel gets a butch haircut & now looks a lot more like Captain Michael.The moronic writers at Marvel kill off one of the most iconic characters... IronMan!The vast majority of the film is spent dealing with Time Travel & more Time Travel...
1014,"Basically; nothing new happens. The avengers decide to go back in time to (unsuccessfully) tug at our nostalgia heartstrings. They revisit past scenes of previous movies for the first 2/3rds of the movie.The final third is just a big battle which we've seen a thousand times prior. In fact, it's the battle from infinity war - probably with recycled graphics. The only decent part of this movie was Caps ending, there was a certain satisfaction to seeing the man who fought others battles in a world he didn't quite fit in, finally get what he always wanted; a normal life with the woman he loved.Other than that, hilariously bad and overrated culmination of the marvel universe. The characters we have watched grow over the years become shells of their older selves. Key moments are misused. The famous Thanos 'snap' is overused. The heart wrenching Spider Man moment is replicated horribly. Repeated catchphrases felt hollow.The Black Widow sacrifice yielded no emotional impact, at all. The Iron Man sacrifice was pointless for the sake of being pointless. We've seen all of this before. I could go on and on about the problems with this movie but you get the idea."
1015,"I have watched movies and rated them 1/10 without writing a review. But Avengers: Engame build up so much momentum with Infinity War and all that PR upfront, positioning A:E as the ultimate finally of the MCU that the failing of the movie is ultimately that - the sad finally of the MCU.Cinematography: Well done, good CGI as in previous films. Some scenes were shot to dramatic for the actual content of that scene but that's pathos (not a relative of Thanos) in American cinema. Some surprise moments that would are shot perfectly highlighting them (Captain America).Storyline:
*If you don't mind spending the ticket money please watch the movie and decide for yourself.*
Time Travel is a tricky concept with different approaches but there are some theories established and they simply make certain developments during or after time travel impossible / illogical. At this point, I can get behind Stark figuring out time travel with Quantum mechanics. After that the problems for that movie start...A) Illogic of time travel:
The group enables Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos to follow them into the 5 year future where he tries to grab all stones at once. This Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos gets killed in the future which makes it impossible and illogical for all the things happening from the time that Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos left his timeline, e.g. the Infinity War movie and all this Thanos did in his quest for the stones.
If Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos leaves his time (past) into the future and no Infinity War happens, Starks Timeline with a daughter also would not happen. Nevertheless, she keeps on existing after Pre-Infinity-War-Snap-No-Stone-Thanos is killed in the future. Zero logic.B) The handling of the stones:
Thanos has his gauntlet specially made in Nidavellir with the power of a star as all stones together hold all of reality. Now all it takes is Stark and some nano-tech to handle them and channel their power? Not realistic by the logic of the MCU explained before.
B.a.) For Ronan (Guardians I) it was almost impossible to wield one infinity stone and the Guardians barely and only survived by splitting the energy between them. The Hulk is almost killed but survives because it's Gamma Ray- okay. But that Stark simply can put on all stones and is not instantly ripped apart makes all previous told content irrelevant and makes this facet of the MCU ridiculous. It's a story line decision to kill of Stark for dramatic reasons but there would have been much better, logical ways. Other characters like a god (Thor) could have handled the stones by the unrealistic Iron Man gauntlet adopting to the persons hand.Over all, a white board, pen and a few hours would have shown the writers where the illogic happens and how to make it right in the sense of simple reasonable logic. This however is an unworthy end to the MCU and previous film."
1016,"Well first off, Infinity War is one of my favourite movies of all time, and I feel the expectations I had built from that, has impacted how I feel about this movie.Their are some really beautiful scenes and some great fan service which deserves a mention, in a movie that feels like a stepping stone to promote some of the characters that recently failed in the comics. We are entering the get woke, go broke phase of the MCUNow onto the movie:The plot line is all over the place and they made the mistake of using time travel to fix the universes problems, there are no consequences for failure anymore in the mcu, because just like in Dragon all we can just ""Wish back"" all those who died. Its basically Back To The Future, the Thanos edition.Once again, they sideline Thor and The Hulk by using them purely as a punchline for lame, low IQ jokes in a corny script that feels like it is trying to be so many things, but doesn't quite hit the mark. Thor spends the entire movie as a whiny, fat child with mommy issuesAlthough there were some very nice, touching moments to the movie I feel like most of the mourning and brooding could have been condensed into a montage in order for us to see the heroes do, exactly what we came to see the heroes do, fight bad guys. There's very little in the way of action and because the story was so all over the place, I left feeling like nothing was actually accomplished in this movie.As always Tony is amazing, throwing out one liners and nicknames and Captain America is great too.Overall I really enjoyed many aspects of it, but at the same time I felt like there was no control over the plot. Like they were more concerned with paying homage to EVERY character ever, before writing a great narrative."
1017,"After the events from Infinity War, for those who survived life has not been easy, but make the best of what they can, until Ant Man comes in the picture, has the equipment to time travel, so they all make a plan to go back in time and get the stones before Thanos does, but the question is will they succeed?
The best of all marvel movies, everybody gives a great performance, in my opinion nobody really stands out. It's a three hour film, but sure doesn't feel like it, so well paced. Effects are excellent, also don't disappoint. For all Marvel fans, please don't miss this."
1018,"Over the last few years I have seen quite a few films including all 21 Marvel Cinematic Universe Films so I was unbelieveably excited for Avengers: Endgame and I have to be honest this is my favourite cinema experience of all time. As a casual fan you can enjoy this film but as a person who has been such a huge fan of this universe since the first Iron Man this film is executed absolutley perfectly. This is also the hardest film to review ever as nobody should have this film spoiled for them and the trailers have been incredibly vague but I will give it a go. So the premise of the film is set after the events of Avengers Infinity War and sees the Avengers attempt to fix the destruction that Thanos caused in that film. Now the cast is absolutley huge but I am only going to talk about a few so this review isn't really long, for fans of Chris Evans as Captain America who were disappointed with his role in Infinity War, they will be pleased with his role in this film as he is excellent and at the forefront. Similar to this Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark is obviously fantastic and totally owns the role, Chris Hemsworth as Thor & Scarlet Johansson as Balck Widow are great in their huge roles. But i wanted to talk about some suprisingly great perfromances, this is easily the best Jeremy Renner performance as Hawkeye, he is a damaged character and has way more depth to his performance in this film. Paul Rudd as Ant-Man really works in this ensemble cast, his style of humour really fits well with the other Avengers and was a great balance to the others. Possibly the biggest suprise is Karen Gillan as Nebula who is really fleshed out in this film and I really enjoyed her character arc especially from the first Guardians film to now. For those people that love Josh Brolin as Thanos this film isn't really about him, Infinity War is his film but he is more of a supporting player in this story but he is still great. I can't talk much about the story but it has a perfect mix of drama and humour, also has a great blend of character moments and epic spectacle. That's all I am going to say about the story but it is truly epic. The script is great, with a really good blend with humour and drama you will be laughing one moment and possibly crying the next and that makes this film special. The style just aids in making this film feel truly epic, the action scenes are great and feels different to other Marvel films. Overall this film is going to be remembered as one of the greatest of all time, this expereience has hit me emotionally and I have seen this film twice already and I can see myself watching this film over and over to come for many of years to come."
1019,"Yep, this surpassed ""The Dark Knight Rises"" for its length although I think the uncut version of ""Watchmen"" might be even longer. Everyone was hyped to see this movie particularly with how the Avengers would defeat Thanos. They do it in the first 20 minutes, rather easily. People were also wondering how Ant-Man would be freed from the quantum realm. That happens immediately afterwards, and it's done accidentally by a rat. And we still have two and a half hours left!The basic plot is that Ant-Man tells everyone that time moves differently in the quantum realm and they can use this knowledge to get the Infinity Stones from the past. Turns out they can't actually change the past, so it's safe for them to do whatever they want, as long as they find the Stones. The time travel bit comes in exactly an hour long. I looked at my watch! They get the Stones and have to deal with Thanos from the past coming which happens exactly at the two hour mark. Dang, this was wonderfully paced!I think this is the last Avengers movie, even though there will be more movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I saw this for my 30th birthday and knew I had to see something that special for it. My mom was crying when all the superheroes came back at the end. It's very difficult to keep up the interest in a movie for over three hours and you have to be a movie as awesome as this to do that! Time travel's always a lot of fun and we get great interactions from all the characters as normal. If only we had a scene after the credits! ****"
1020,"I don't have to give away any spoilers to say this movie was terrible. I was so excited to see this movie. First, I have watched every superhero movie that lead to the creation of this movie. Please don't believe the critic reviews or other obviously paid for reviews. This movie was horribly boring, with very limited action. I enjoy comicbook and fantasy movies, but I also enjoy a good drama. The issue isn't that I couldn't appreciate the emotional aspect of the movie, it's simply that it was done very poorly. There were so many issues with the plot, and characters, but worst of all is a tremendous amount of pointless, long sections of uninteresting dialog. On top of this, the very few action scenes that were in the movie were really poorly done. For the most part, they were a blurry, choppy mess, and you couldn't appreciate what was happening enough to make it effective and cool. If you like movies that are boring, and try to play on your heart strings in a really contrived way, instead of being entertaining, then this is the perfect movie for you."
1021,Firstly. I would like to clarify myself that I am a huge fan of marvel and never miss any movies right from the start. IW is a gem and rewatched over 10 times. All actors and actresses in these movies are simply the best in the world.BUT hey! This endgame is a joke! There is no way that I can fully focus on the movie due to the ridiculous plot holes. Time travel? Stones to return but no impact to the world that people from the past died? There's too many questions in my brain now. The more you think the worse it gets.Come on Marvel fans. You are ok to accept the epic era ends with a fat and lazy Thor and a nerd Hulk who can't fight? Not me.
1022,Not fair to Thor. 5/10 Cheesy jokes and So conclusion. Just A Business Movie on Super Hyped Fan base.
1023,"Marvel fan for years now and I am disappointed about Endgame.Avengers 2 is much better, full of action with multiple scenes, full cover for each single hero"
1024,"When I went to Endgame I was sad knowing it was the end of an era, but I didn't know how much it would affect me. Being Marvel's most ambitious movie to date (and longest) this did not disappoint in anyway. Being said that this movie is three hours long and in my opinion it was paced better than Infinity War. Through the MCU we have seen tremendous lose but the most tragic must have been the lose of Thor's six pack. This movie made me laugh more than any other MCU movie to date. For being such a serious movie the jokes were superb with perfect timing. With the story of time travel seeing characters take these changes like Thor seeing his mother and Cap seeing Peggy and tony seeing his father really created terrific character building. But most of all this movie was really emotional for me. For clarification before I sat in that theater I had not cried in two years. These movies had been such a huge part of my life for 10 years. And as I watched Tony take his final breath tears were running down my face because he was basically the face of my childhood. The MCU I would say was one of the things that made me, well me. But in conclusion I was having a hard time saying my favorite movie ever. This is it. I will remember this movie for the rest of my like. Thank you Marvel for making me into the person I am today. I love you three thousand"
1025,"I signed up to IMDB today just to write this. No spoilers here as I am myself a big big fan of Marvel movies. Was so looking forward to this movie but I have been dissapointed completely and feel it left me broken. I am a movie buff though dont really go to theatres to watch movies, the last one I saw in theatre was BAHUBALI 2 (Indian movie - sequel to Bahubali) and before that was 3 IDIOTS (Indian movie starring Aamir Khan). So I am very selective as which film deserve to be watched on the big screen, otherwise I just wait for the DVDs to come out. If people reading this know the 2 Indian movies I wrote about, Endgame was expected to be that level and its predecessor, Infinity War or may be even better. I dont feel the contentment I was hoping for, infact I feel like I will probably not go to theatres anymore after this has let me down. I dont want to hurt anyone's sentiments but this is my opinion (and I have the right to express my feelings so dont take it personally and me myself as a fan I feel I have been cheated). Thats all from me for MARVEL universe and the duo directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. GOODBYE."
1026,"I don't understand guys, seriously. I mean, HOW DARE YOU KILL TONY STARK, EH? This movie was suck. Everyone got their happy ending except Black Widow and Iron Man. I seriously loved this characters. If courage is a super-power, they had the best superpowers!"
1027,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations."
1028,"Easily the worst MCU movie even worse than Ragnarök, with ita only redeeming qualities being a beautiful, though rushed, ending to the first arc of the MCU and the occasional moment of heartfelt nostalgia.Instead of delivering on any of the setup from the last movies, e.g. the unresolved conflict from Civil War and pulling a The Last Jedi, they veered off into a trip down memory lane and threw out any kind of internal logic in order to so, with the result being that most of movie feels like filler.Further in analogy to TLJ they chose to undercut almost every emotional scene with terrible comedy and they turned characters such as Thor and Hulk, who had almost recovered from their excruciating treatment in Ragnarök, into caricatures of their Avengers 1 glory.I almost could not bear remaining in the cinema until the last few minutes of mostly genuine emotion."
1029,"Seems that they separated every good parts and put them in Infinity Wars and leftovers into this one. Plot is ridiculous, with most of the heroes unused/underused. Are those actors even involved in making of this movie? It is more like clip show episode, made of chaotic parts from previous Avengers, where even CGI quality is different or in the worst case, they combine new things into old scenes, so difference in quality is even more obvious.Time will lower rating of this movie when hype stop. Now, this movie is first one in All time worldwide gross, so it will be more criticized (Avatar can rest now).I watched it in full cinema in first days of screening. We laughed on stupidity of some scenes (every one in theater). At the end, on exit, after 3 hours of painfully boring and bad movie, nobody talked about it... Just wanted to leave this misery behind it."
1030,"Like many others, I was excited for this movie following the end of Infinity Wars. I let my mind wander with all the elaborate plot predictions, new characters revealed, epic battles and an emotional thread bringing it all together that infinity wars did so well.What I got was a good movie, rushed with minimal character development and what left me hoping for an extended cut when the movie comes to the small screen.Thanos, such a complex character walking the tightrope of his moral compass in infinity wars, was suddenly a megalomaniac hell bent on destruction of all. Thor, given character by ragnarok and purpose by infinity wars, was completely trivialised into a humorous side character. Hulk was lazily reduced to a new hybrid version of ""Professor Hulk"" with little explanation why. And when all the ""dead"" characters came back it was just accepted and let's get on with it.This movie had the potential to be a real emotional roller coaster but they blew it, rushed through he serious moments in an effort to play homage to the previous films (which I felt was a great touch though). The sequences of events in getting the stones just seemed a hastily put together series of interactions that needed more depth.Then finally, the battle - I was excited when I looked at my watch and realised we had over na hour left in the film. Then disappointed when it effectively ended 15 minutes later.I think this should have been split into two movies - the first an emotional journey into the past, reuniting heroes with their origin stories and showing how far they had come while bringing each deceased hero back with appropriate fanfare. The second, the right level of preparation, battlecries and depth to make a modern epic.I still enjoyed it and need to watch again, probably when it's released to on demand. But the excitement I had from the hyped reviews quickly evaporated. Interested to see what the consensus is in a few weeks. My consensus, missed opportunity."
1031,"Never seen such a pathetic movie, they didn't meet my expect ions, it has no comparison with Infinity War. The whole plot lack to build a sequence."
1032,"The avengers: End game movie is the worst out of all the marvel movies. With an horrible end and a bad plot. For a normal, sane person this is a too wacky movie with a lot of weird twists. The only really good thing in this movie is the avengers theme song that gives the movie a little spark in the total darkness that it is in. If you consider watching this movie DON'T."
1033,"Robert Downey Jr.'s gaunt Tony Stark records his message to his beloved Pepper Potts, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, aboard the disabled spaceship last seen in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", ""Part of the journey is the end..."" After 11 years of Marvel movies, Directors Anthony Russo and Joe Russo's ""Avengers: Endgame"" signifies the end of the journey with laughter and surprising poignancy. At one point holdout Avengers leader Natasha (former assassin Black Widow), played by beautiful soulful Scarlett Johansson, refers to the Avengers as ""family"". That resonates for us, too. For the last 11 years these screen Heroes have become family. We care what becomes of them. Do they find peace? Do they discover love?""Endgame"" screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely patiently crescendo to the showdown with seemingly omnipotent galactic villain Thanos, motion captured by malevolently measured Josh Brolin, whom defeated the Avengers, by wiping out half of all life in the universe using the Infinity Gauntlet possessing all 6 Infinity Stones. The climactic battle is visually astounding, and oh so costly. Yet, what inspires most about ""Endgame"" is family and heart.Most of ""Endgame"" takes place 5 years after Titan's Warrior Thanos decimated half the population of the universe, including about half of the Avengers. Here less is actually more. Where as in ""Avengers: Infinity War"", way too many Superheroes resulted in the kluged narrative, focusing on the surviving Heroes: Chris Evans's Captain America (Steve Rogers), Robert's Iron Man, and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, displaced God of Thunder, empowers the story. Brie Larson's all-powerful Captain Marvel charismatically emerges as the new Avenger. Too bad the Russo's couldn't leverage more for Brie. Then again, that might have been narrative saturation.Where ""Infinity War"" was so dour and so self-absorbed, ""Endgame"" has a wicked sense of humor. Mark Ruffalo's glasses wearing civilized green giant Hulk taking selfies with adoring teen fans is hysterical. Critical to restoring their fallen Heroes in Thanos's aftermath, the surviving Avengers utilize time travel in hopes of preventing Thanos from possessing all Infinity Stones. In the hilarious expository exchange regarding the effects of changing past and future events: ""This is not 'Back to the Future'."" No, it's not. And I busted out laughing.The human narrative touches in ""Endgame"". The distinct strength of the Marvel Universe Movies are its Actors. Travelling back to 1970, Robert's Tony Stark meets his estranged Father Howard, the genius engineer, played by earnest John Slattery. Howard has no idea that he's talking to his future son, because his wife is about to give birth. Robert's authentic compassion moves. Tony hugs Howard, who expressed doubt about being a good Father, saying, ""It'll work out."" Then you realize that was the only time the two had ever hugged. On that same trip back, Chris Evans's Steve wistfully gazes at Peggy Carter, played by captivating Hayley Atwell. Peggy is the forsaken love of Cap's life.Chris Hemsworth's Thor travels back to the Norse legendary Asgard to retrieve an Infinity Stone. He encounters his mortal Mother Frigga, the powerful sorceress played by beautiful strong Rene Russo, on the day she's to die. In a subdued joke, rotund Thor has seen better days, since failing to dispatch Thanos in ""Infinity War"". His loving Mom tells her son that she knows that he's suffered. Looking into his eyes Frigga says, ""The measure of the Hero is being true to yourself."" Amen.Really, ""Endgame"" is awesome, because of heart. In that Karen Gillan is understated power as the mostly machine Nebula, daughter of Thanos. Her Father had contested her against sister Gamora, played by brilliantly strong Zoe Saldana, for his love. Tortured and devalued Nebula, becomes ravaged with vengeance upon her Father. Yet, Karen makes us believe that Nebula's soul is worth salvation.Yeah, at 3 hours and 1 minutes ""Endgame"" is the restroom challenge. I kid, well sort of. Despite all that, I loved ""Avengers: Endgame"". It's the poignant, whimsical end of the journey. At least for me, the Avengers are my fictional Hero family. Like the characters on the wide screen, we all experience suffering, profound loss, joy, and triumph. In life, like Chris's Cap says, ""Take your baby steps... Move forward."" I for one shall remember the Avengers in my heart."
1034,"For those who are not entirely familiar with the Marvel Universe as offered in The Avengers series, Phase 1 introduces some of the Avengers with their own separate movies, culminating in their first assignment together. Phase 2 continues the development, adds more members and moves on to their second assignment. Phase 3 starts with a twist seeing the members pitched against one another in two groups and, towards the end, brings up their most formidable opponent by far.More specifically, Phase 1 comprises 6 movies starting with ""Ironman"" (2008), then introduces The Hulk (Edward Norton at the time), Thor and Captain America, culminating in ""The Avengers"" (2012) which shows these four teaming up with Black Widow and Hawkeye for the initial lineup.Phase 2, commencing with ""Iron Man 3"" (2013), uses another 6 movies to trace the evolution of the Avengers. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) detailing their second assignment adds to the team two major players, Scarlet Witch and Vision. Another entirely different team is also introduced in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" although their path has not yet converged with that of the original Avengers in this Phase. ""Ant-man"" (2015), with his own stand-alone movie, brings up the rear of this Phase.Phases 3, with a total of 11 movies, starts with ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016), which has been given the nicknamed ""Avengers 2.5"". The Avengers are divided into two groups, under Iron Man and Captain America, supporting and opposing, respectively, government supervision. While the Hulk and Thor are nowhere to be seen, newcomers brought in are Spider-man and Black Panther, plus a few others who have already appeared before (Ant-man, Falcon, War Machine, Winter Soldier). Then, more blanks are filled in. A new character, Dr. Strange, is introduced via his own stand-alone. Also in their own stand-alone movies are Spider-man and Black Panther, introduced belatedly. The whereabouts of Thor and the Hulk is revealed via another sequel of the former's franchise, in which another new character Valkyrie is introduced.Then comes the long awaited ""Avengers: Infinity War"", #8 in Phase 3 (and #20 in the entire ""Infinite Saga""). The ultimate villain Thanos, menacingly lurking behind hitherto, comes to the forefront. Everybody mentioned above in the Avengers community join force, including the convergence with Guardians of the Galaxy whose key character Gamora is Thanos's alienated adopted daughter. Well, almost everybody. Ant-man and Hawkeye are not there.The devastating conclusion of Infinity War sees Thanos, at a snap of his finger, literally, kills off half the world's population, completely at random. That of course includes members of The Avengers, also entirely at random. Following that are two blank-filling movies. ""Ant-man and the Wasp"" explains why it was absent and introduces yet another new superhero The Wasp. Completing the assembly comes ""Captain Marvel"", hitherto unheard of, until the post-credit of Infinity War when Nick Fury, just before disintegration, sends her an S.O.S. message, as the court of last appeal.In the trailer of ""Avengers: Endgame"", when one of the Avengers, not addressing anybody in particular, says ""Why would it be different from before?"" Without missing a beat Captain Marvel replies ""Before, you didn't have me."" You will see this within the opening minutes of Endgame.So, where is my user review? There is so much to say. To non-fans, that wouldn't mean a lot. To hard-core fans who have watched each and every one of the 21 preceding movies starting from over a decade ago, it is quite unnecessary. I'll just sum everything up with three little words: down memory lane."
1035,"Sidenote: this again is a review for a film I am writing as college homework so do bear with me for any SPAG errors.Welp, it has been a good 11 years of the MCU with some amazing films, sure there might be some bad movies such as Iron Man 3 and Captain Marvel but other then that the MCU has had many impressive films and now we come down to the endgame. Ever since 2008 there have been around 22 movies and now we probably have the best movie of the MCU in my opinion although, it is on a sub-par with infinity wars. I also felt very emotional because of a death of a character specifically an avenger not going to say who otherwise I might spoil too much.I finally got around to seeing it yesterday and I am completely mind blown. I was very disappointed with Captain marvel day before yesterday when I watched it but after this movie I am fully happy. I remember saying that Avengers Infinity Wars was the best movie of 2019 at present.If you have not caught up with the MCU like my sister was yesterday or if you haven't watch Infinity wars yet I recommend you watch all those first because to understand this movie you need to understand them first. Also, this review is filled with spoilers so if you don't want to get spoiled get out of my review right now and watch those movies before you continue reading. Cause this movie is going to be hard not to spoil.So, endgame takes off where infinity wars ended/ant man and the wasp post credits scene, when everyone but a few avengers disappear. It had been 3 weeks ever since Thanos wiped out human life on the earth, they find out where Thanos is hiding Thor kills him because he got rid of the infinity stones. They also take the infinity gauntlet with them.5 years laterCaptain America, War Machine and Black Widow are still figuring out what to do? Thor goes his separate ways, Hawkeye becomes a vigilante in Tokyo still grieving over his disappeared family, Iron Man starts a life with Pepper and has a daughter, Hulk mixes his brains and brawns together, Thor alongside the Asgardians and ant man finally escapes the microzone only to find out that Thanos invaded the earth and wiped out the population.They realise the only way they could restore everything is if they go back in time and stop Thanos from getting the stones so each of the avengers have a pym particle which can send them back in a moment in time before Thanos got to them. I enjoyed this scene because it gives me memories of each movie I watched of the MCU and makes me relive a few of their best moments. However, there was a high price for this.The effects in the movie were good, the camera angel was excellent and the time and pacing of the story was good too. The cast including Chris Evens, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Pratt, Scarlett Johnanson, Elizabeth Olson, Josh Brolin, Bradley Cooper, Robert Downy Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Tom Holland, Paul Rudd, Don Cheadle, Zoe Saldana, Evangeline Lilly, Chadwick Boseman, Karen Gillan, Tessa Thompson, Benedict Cumberbatch, Anthony Mackie , Rene Russo, Dave Bautista, John Slattery, Sebastian Stan, Hayley Atwell, Emma Fuhrmann (who knew after 5 years Cassie would become hot) Vin Diesel, Gwyneth Paltrow and everyone else did a good job as their roles. I am going to really miss Chris Evens and Robert Downy Jr as their roles.My only fault with this film is that there was a lot of talking in comparative to the last movie and a lot is going on at once. But that was my only fault.The best scenes in this movie are when we go back in the past and Steve gets to see Peggy again, Tony gets to meet his dad, the fight scene when Captain America gets to fight Captain America (I wonder how long that took for Chris Evens to film), the final fight between thanos and when War Machine calls ant man regular size man.This is possibly the best movie I have seen in 2019 I could even give it a 15, 50 or even 100 if I could. Thank you, Stan Lee (RIP), Kevin Forge and everyone who worked on this movie I really loved every bit of it.If you actually, decided to continue reading and haven't seen the movie it. Opps, but I still recommend you watch this movie."
1036,By the time Avengers: Endgame (2019) still fresh in my mind I can say that this movie is one of the best well spend 3 hours in my life and the best conclusion to the first chapter in the MCU history. I can't wait to see how they outdo all of this in the next 10 years
1037,"You'll cheer, you'll laugh and you'll cry.But most importantly, you will enjoy.Avengers: Endgame turned out to be more than wished for and delivered all the action, humor and emotions balanced in a perfect manner.One must not forget that it's not a standalone film and due to that, the slow pace in the first half can be understood. It will however not bore you for even a second, that's for sure. All action sequences are masterfully crafted and choreographed, further backed not only by the CGI but also a strong thread of emotions that seems to drive everything in this film.The directors have dealt with the characters quite well. All performances are impressive, but Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans truly win hearts. If you've been following all MCU movies since Iron Man (2008), there's no way you won't like it.It's a great action movie, a great comic book movie, a true crowd-pleaser and possibly the best superhero movie, but first and foremost, it's... it's a...I'm speechless."
1038,"Warning do not read unless seen film.It's was a long time coming but it was well worth the wait (for me anyway) and the film is somewhat an end of an era for the MCU. The film is fitting in many ways as this helps celebrate another grand anniversary for Marvel, the late great Stan Lee whom makes one final cameo here, but also the departure of most of the MCU alumni as it's their last film.This film is different, from the fact it's one of the longest comic book film yet almost the length of ""The Ten Commandments"", ok not really but clocked at three hours it's close. But the pacing was good I hardly noticed the time at all. But also just it's overall format as it's sort of like with the film ""A Better Tomorrow 2"" (I said sort of) It's all a big build up to lead you to a phenomenal payoff; and that's not a bad thing as it kept me enthralled and invested in the characters and what their doing. This film is dark as usual but has a mix of emotion which makes the film bittersweet at time, where there are some exciting and cheerful parts but then there are some tragic moments, one moment I won't say what put tears in my eyes along with most of the other audience, where I actually heard some crying behind me.The first half of the film it's sort of a character drama as we see each of the Avengers deal with aftermath blues. Five years have passed and we see just like the post-apocalyptic world their living in everyone is just broken, I'll admit it was pretty damn sad watching this, even the very beginning of the film was tragic, which I'll admit is something different for a comic book adaptation film where it would usually start of with wham bam action, this just isn't that time nor day for the Avengers.There are certain scenes of grimness like Scott Lang/Ant Man whom is visiting a memorial site which has lots of walls and names and he is making sure his daughter isn't on there, same with myself. Or even Natasha/Black Widow whom we see is the new head of S.H.E.L.D. (or should I say broken shield) as she's talking with the others you see her eating what looks like an unappetizing and not completely healthy sandwich. Things like that just show how time doesn't heal all wounds, it leave a scar; it makes sense the Avengers would all be in a bad states of mind because before Thanos they all had lives and people in them which gave them reasons to fight for, strip all that away and they have nothing their practically directionless and roleless. This goes to show how truly human the Avengers are, their all are living in crap county and can't find a way out; this just even more makes us want the Avengers to rise again not just to save the universe but to save their own souls.Each of the characters are good they all have their moments and hand in things, but also some good drama. I just state some of the ensemble.
Thanos (Josh Brolin): as usual is good, really like how he still a force to be reckoned with and isn't going to go easy on them anytime soon. There is one moment in the final battle that was so satisfying when he delivers a power punch to one character, I'm not a fan of, I won't say who, but I don't think I'm alone in saying it actually put a smile on my face.Ant Man/Scott Lang (Paul Rudd): he's his usual fun self but I really like how in some of the beginning and a bit of the rest of the film he's almost the main hero as he's the one that is not just offering a opportunity but also really helping bring the band back together.Thor (Chris Helmsworth): he's fun as usual, it's funny how he sorts of looks and is dressed like The Dude from ""The Big Lebowski"" but at the same time sad as it's shown how badly the aftermath blues have hit him. It sorts of your getting back in the saddle story where we see slowly but surely in the adventure, he's starting to become himself again.Clint/Hawkeye/Ronin (Jeremy Reiner): His character is tragic in this film; from the loss he's endeared he's became a shadow of himself. No longer an agent of Shield, he has become a Mercenary which we know in the comics as Ronin, where we see him not just use the bow but the katana which I thought was cool. Really like his back and forth with Natasha/Black Widow she's sort of like the sister he never had, she really helps in not just going on this quest but also toward self-forgiveness to reclaim his soul.Tony/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr) is also great, it's interesting seeing him settled down with his wife Pepper and have a daughter Morgan, which makes sense if you remember the Matt Fraction run. Despite slightly settled in his ways he doesn't feel he's finished, and he wants to give his family a better place to live in.The Third and final half is just a phenomenal payoff as it turns into a war movie where we see pretty much 20-30 minute all out war. I won't say most of what happens you must see it all for yourself. But I really like before the battle begins we see as Thanos is giving a bit of a speech, just the look on some of the Avengers emerging from the rubble and the look Steve, Thor, and Tony all have is just great as each of them are just beyond pissed like Jason Vorhees pissed, you just know Thanos is a dead man now. It was great seeing all three just giving all they had on Thanos, Cap with his regular Shield once more don't get me wrong liked the double shields he had but it just isn't quite the same, the circular vibranium shield is still my favorite. Iron Man as usual unleashing his arsenal. But best of all-seeing Thor kicking ass once more but we actually see him duel weld by using not just the Storm Breaker but the Valkyr which I though was a welcome return, as much as I like the axe hammer, I still prefer the first.However the biggest pay off is really what happens in the duration of the time when lets just say we all get the best Christmas present of all which of course lead to the biggest applause and cheering of all in fact two of them; it was such an exciting moment I don't see often. It was just the biggest love letter that spelled Marvel; but most importantly the film reminds us and makes us grateful of the importance of having heroes/superheroes around.Now I'm going to get real guys, for some of the Marvel movie alumni thanks and hopefully we'll see much more in the future. But as for the cast of the Avengers and the characters themselves, thanks for what you've done over the years, without you there wouldn't be an MCU or even a Marvel which is why it's sad to see you go, but you fought your final fight and now it's time to rest. And for Stan Lee I'll miss you, you were the Where's Waldo for the MCU film, but more than that a big influence and inspiration in my life, rest in peace man.Avengers Assemble.Rating: 4 stars"
1039,"***Minor Spoilers (that may be significant for some)***Avengers: Endgame is what happens a group of devoted filmmakers set up shop and pay off a decade's worth of storytelling on the big screen in a bombastic yet surprisingly satisfying way. First off, to prove I saw the movie, it starts off with Clint's family getting 'dusted' right after the SNAP in Infinity War. And from then on, it's a post-disaster movie trying to address the previous movie's aftermath. All the while it becomes a Back to the Future-like adventure on steroids and it even has Terminator callbacks as well. And it's got the emotional gravitas of Toy Story 3. Oh: and Thor's chubby in this, and a MASSIVE troll online whenever Korg needs him to be (in ### ######). It's got taught writing with just as focused direction telling a story through the action as opposed to action taking over the story.SEE THIS MOVIE! It's as much movie a movie can get this year! And we've still got PLENTY of other goods on the horizon still.5/5 stars."
1040,"Many things do not make any sense.
They made a boring mess of hulk.
It is worth to be watched, but not to be excited about it. I can forgive a few logical incongruences but there is way so many."
1041,"In arguably the most anticipated movie of the year and one of the most anticipated movies of all time, Avengers: Endgame was well on its way with all the hype leading up to the film. Having enjoyed Infinity War but thought it could have been better all around, the overall hype for Endgame had its match made. Now having watching this film in theaters as it was a must watch to (due to the 3D experience and also knowing the longer one waited, the more likely spoilers would have been exposed, ruining the experience and essence of the film).As a film, won't say much but this film delivers on expectations. Had no knowledge of the overall plot but within the first few minutes, one was excited and was there for the thrill of the ride throughout. With a runtime of over three hours (including end credits), the film has a great pace and doesn't feel nearly as long (which is great since something is always happening). Due to its great cast and plethora of characters, there really is never a dull moments and the film is ensured and filled with moments of surprise, suspense, action emotion and overall greatness.Now the overall plot of time travel was well done and brought back many memories to the other Avenger films. The wait for the film was most definitely worth it, and this film will most doubly become one of the biggest movies of alltime. Will need to see this film probably once more in theaters before its run is over and most definitely will see it again multiple times afterwards to soak in its greatness. Avengers: Endgame is more than a movie, it's a moment - a moment in time. Cherish every moment."
1042,This movie kinda sucked. Even worse than most other Marvel movies. It was just a mess. They shouldn't have even tried to explain their time traveling/dimension jumping. Quantum physics? Really? Ok. This movie overall is a comedy. There are a few pretty funny jokes. But most movies are much better than this movie.
1043,Wonderful film I don't know how to describe❤Graphicand effects everything wow❤
1044,"3 Hours full of emotion, action, tears and laugh.This is how you end the filmBeautiful, impactful, amazing"
1045,"Movie overall is okej. But for being an 3 hours movie i expected alot more!
Slow first hour, messy story telling and they really destroyed couple of characters with jokes and pure boring stuff.
It felt like 10 different people wanted to get their story/scen idea in the movie.
I have been marvel fan all my life, but this movie was far the most disappointed one i have seen and they really ruined couple of characters for me.
You should see it, still okej movie but not more."
1046,I love this the full avengers and marvel is my favourite and I made stormbreaker infinity gaunlet Spiderman web shooters Dr strange eye if agomoto and Captain America's shield I am a biggest fan of marvel
1047,I truly like this movie than before. Their fighting are memorable. 10 points for this amazing movie!!
1048,"Cant imagine that i could ever see this amazing movie, its a three hours movie but it only feels like one hour! Every scene has its own characteristic that makes this movie very good!"
1049,This is the best movie ever nothing can or will beat avengers endgame
1050,"Not being a Marvel-fan (nor DC by the way, which seems to be important to the fans) I liked it's direct prequel better. It's an ok movie really, but it had no surprises in it for me."
1051,Truely ..... Best.... Just want if Captain Marvel did not showed up...... Only that character make the film out of perfection.
1052,"This was a fun movie, but it was by means no where near a 10/10. Infinity War was a much better movie to be honest. It had way better action and a better story. End Game's plot was a mess. Overall, it was an entertaining and fitting end to an era, but was by no means perfect."
1053,"I just don't get it. I tried to like this vacuous American drivel, but just can't. The whole thing is a stupid train wreck of nonsensical characters. hammy acting, loud thuds, baloney quasi-science and space effects. Just act well, have a worthwhile narrative, but no.Glinty effect hard on the eye visuals, like you just ate a kilogram of gummy bears, and now nature wants revenge. The acting is the worst, good actors that are aware of the camera and crew, so actually direction fail. Make a some cringe joke to try to distract.Just listen to the dialogue: I know, we'll use ether to time travel to go back in time to Asguard on board the muppet ship to get to the Smurf nano-crystals from Dr Oddface. Or something like that.Individually a character like Spiderman is fine, but with a Norse God and a talking chipmunk? It's like having a 'bonus' Hawaiian pizza. Not only do you get pineapple but you get chocolate and anchovies because more 'must' simply be better?Save it for a long haul flight or download it to your phone so you can watch it when you're on the throne. Well possibly your cell phone game might be more fun. If your IQ is under 70 or you are under 14 you might like it. Avoid the 3D version unless you like migraines and blurred vision, the gimmick that just won't die."
1054,"I hope The whole world get to watch it, its a Game Changer Not Alike Any Ever Done"
1055,This ties everything into a perfect little bow but this us not the end of MCU
1056,This movie is nothing but what a comic book fan expects.... The movie brings out an epic climax battle which makes fan go crazy...
1057,Yyyeeesssss that's the marvel movie that we need just grat and brilliant!
1058,Went into movie theater expecting an epic finale and a much better movie than infinity war; alas it was so anti climatic so boring so full of plot holes an elephant would've passed through them - or a hulk for that matter - very disappointing movie overall!!!
1059,"Unnecessary emotions, focus on only Captain America and Iron man, Role of Thor is just for joke."
1060,"Visuals, plot, intelligence, emotions, with great acting ....what else do you want in a movie. Directors Anthony and Joe Russo have given their best with positive results. The INFINITY SAGA ends."
1061,"End game is a culmination of over a decade of films and Marvel pulled it off better than any production company before them. The full cast were all second to none, the script was very well thought out and the action gave us all if not most, exactly why we had hoped for. There are sad moments, funny lines, dramatic build ups and the to trained eye, a closure to a lot of stories spanning from many fans would have even been born. Personally I've watched the film 6 times now and love it every time."
1062,"Good sacrifices, good acting, great cgi, but nerfed thanos and his army, fan service by disney."
1063,Ending of the Avenger with awesomeness but I feel little slow than other Avenger because of too emotional scenes.
1064,It's not over for cap and ironman. With hulk rebuilt the time machine they can go back in time for them all they need is more of pimms formula. Let's continue the franchise for the fans.
1065,A movie that combined 6 different movie timeline.....
1066,The epic conclusion of Marve's MCU franchise helds with Avengers Endgame which deeply fullfills every desire a marvel fan will want. No.1 in the world
1067,"I loved this movie it was great. The beginning was a bit weak but further into the film it got better and better. I even cried, 3 hours of fun and emotional twists, the Jokes were good they where timed good and they were fun, it really added more sympathy to the characters.10 out of 10 this is a must see"
1068,"I see most people who have decided to review Avengers: Endgame thought the movie was horrible, so I think this film deserves a better rep for those who have yet to see it. Endgame is the conclusion we have all been waiting for from the MCU, and personally I think Endgame did a brilliant job at giving the audience something to cry about, laugh about, smile about, and just love.
Being a huge fan of the Marvel film franchise, I did not think that the ending this movie gave us was lacklustre, or less exciting than Infinity War. Personally, I would have to say this movie was even better than Infinity War, most likely due to the fact that it is the grand finale of all these movies, but honestly the movie was just that memorable.
There was never a moment where I was bored during this 3 hour film. Whilst most people snark at the idea of sitting down for that long for a movie, once I had watched it I fully understood why it had to be that way. To finish this big of a legacy takes a lot of time, and within those 3 hours I could just feel myself submerge into the wider MCU one last time (needless to say, there will be plenty more Marvel movies), and I definitely enjoyed every part of it.
This movie is definitely worth a watch if you like action, romance, heartbreak, and just an overall good story line. Avengers: Endgame definitely deserves it's praise and so much more."
1069,"This is the best action movie i have seen in my life at no point of it's 3 HOUR runtime was I not interested and at times where the fight scenes were happening I was really pumped and my arm was unironically shacking from all of enjoyment i was having, I remeber laughing alot too at the very funny jokes in the movie."
1070,I don't often write reviews but this movie was so badly done I felt compelled to. That and the overwhelming reviews on here giving it 10/10.The movie completely destroys some of the best built up characters of the series like Thor / Hulk. Even Thanos who was given a brilliant overlay of character traits was discarded with (literally) within the first 15mins of the movie and his return had no character depth at all.The movie also proves Time Travel should never be used as a story botch job. The plotholes are ridiculous including how on earth Thanos is going to make it to the phase of Infinity War given he went to the future and was defeated in the one. That aside how on earth 5 years later all of Peter Parkers classmates are still in high school / the rest of the world literally has not moved on.This gets 3 stars only on the basis that RDJ put in another amazing performance. He should have spearheaded the next phase of storyline as at least an old leader there for inspiration but that of course cant happen now.I haven't felt this annoyed at a movie since I watched The Last Jedi...
1071,"I must have watched Infinity War a dozen times, so as you can expect I was expecting big things from this movie. How wrong was I. Shockingly disappointing. The people on here giving 9 and 10's must be scoring infinity war by mistake. The film was so boring and the story was rubbish. CGI took a massive step back for me. I will not be watching this dribble again. Well unless it's on cable tv at Xmas day in 4 years time and I'm too full of dinner to get up and change the channel."
1072,"Loved, LOVED Infinity War...
End Game on the other hand was utter trash.
I cannot believe the Russo's directed both.
I regret not walking out. The thought crossed my mind at least 3 different times."
1073,"Here it is then, after eleven years and twenty one movies of differing quality, we finally reach the Endgame.But does it deliver?Does it really live up to Infinity Wars sombre ending?Yes, my goodness yes, and despite my expectations being stupendously high on the verge of me thinking that I would not enjoy it, it's easily one of the most satisfying cinema experiences that I have ever experienced.The trailer would lead you to believe that this film would be emotionally draining, the most serious of the MCU, but there is as much humour in this than any of the other phase entries, and they are genuine laugh out loud moments.But the humour does not pull the viewer away from the emotional pull that the characters pour on to the screen, and with every laugh out loud moment, there are some gut punches the film gives that will leave you reeling, if you've been even semi-invested in this behemoth of a cinematic universe.At just over three hours, Endgame truly does not feel like that, and throws some wonderful curve-balls for almost every main character, and Kudos to the Russo Brothers, they give each character a goal, an ambition, that makes you care all the more for their quest.The main meat of the film is the strained relationship between Stark and Rogers, reluctance, denial, guilt, anguish, and anger all play a part when they are together on screen.The second act is the foundation of the film, it's genius, almost jaw-dropping in the fact that it shouldn't make sense, it could easily fail, but the writers have so much respect for the franchise, and filmgoers, that it works so effortlessly.To say a lot about the third act would to give too much away, but viewers will not be disappointed. It delivers on a grandiose scale, almost delusional, but its awe-inspiring stuff.You know not to read any spoilers, and unfortunately they are so easy to find, but everyone knows not to.But rest assured, it left me stunned, satisfied and teary eyed.Marvel have done something epic, and there will not be a film like this around for a very long time."
1074,What a way for Phase 3 to end. Its crazy that you have waited so long for the movie that you have waited for all your life.
1075,"What's funny about Endgame is that it's actually the first Avengers movie where they do in fact 'Avenge'. After the Thanos snap, half the population of the universe disappeared and thus creating the biggest problem the team has ever had to fix. Luckily, Scott and Tony figured out a way to time travel, to undo the snap and attempt to bring back all the people they lost.It's tough to comprehend just how good this film is. On one hand, I do have some minor issues with the middle act as well as questions about all this time travel and the lack of ramifications. However, on the other hand, (and I hate making this as an excuse) but it is a superhero movie after all. How much do you forgive a plot hole here or there? The answer lies with how well you like the 3rd act. Because I do believe the last 45 minutes is some of the best film ever put to screen. The amount of pay-off and satisfaction you get as all 22 films have led to that moment is something I will never forget. I've seen the film twice now, and I nearly teared up merely seeing the portals open, among about 10 other small moments that moved me as well.Of course the MCU will go on and make more billions upon billions as the universe continues to expand, but it won't be the same. We'll never get another core Avengers movie with this cast, and no matter how much or little your invested in the MCU, that has to mean something to you. It made the middle act worth it when the heroes go back and have to relive certain events that we've seen play out in other MCU films. But naturally, that act of the film does play out slower and more plotting than anything else. You certainly feel the lack of Thanos during those sequences. And I think that was my biggest gripe, the antagonist (Thanos) is only really there in the beginning and end, so you never feel true danger that our heroes aren't going to recover the stones for use one more time.With that said, I think the original crew truly give us their best performances yet, and that starts with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr., the heart and soul of this series. I'll admit I did not expect them to kill off only Tony and keep Steve alive, but their arcs are almost perfectly capped off here. Pepper says it perfectly to Tony ""We're going to be alright, you can rest now"".There's not a whole lot to this review, it' mostly just initial thoughts, but if I can stress one thing over anything else, it's thank you. Thank you to Kevin Feige, the Russo Bros, and everyone involved in making this and the other MCU films. It's been one of the greatest pleasures of my life seeing this universe unfold the way it has and it's hard to imagine not having the next phase of films already in the pipeline but Endgame puts a stamp on the end of this series like not other. This was something special, and I don't think we'll ever see it again.10/10"
1076,"To make things simple, this movie is exactly what everyone wanted it to be, including myself of course. It's a great follow-up of the ""Infinity War"" which was simply astonishing and left room for sequel as it manages to maintain the pace, quality and excitement of its predecessor throughout its entire length of over three hours. It manages to be so dramatic, filled with action like every other installment but also very thrilling. You're always kept glued to the screen, waiting for the next thing to arrive with no room for boredom. The way it presents its ideas, its story but especially its action scenes is simply unique. As you can expect, all previous Marvel characters return to the scene with their great actors, which their job flawlessly regardless of the situation.It's one of those rare movie which keep me excited from the first trailer, which generates interest even when it isn't released, which makes me search for the best place in a cinema the moment it appears just to see it as soon as possible. The great part about it though is that it didn't disappoint in any way. Although pretty lengthy, it provided a satisfying watch with a good conclusion to the franchise. I couldn't find almost anything against it, thus the only thing I can do is to award it the maximum rating that it deserves."
1077,My boyfriend truly loves anything Marvel. I would usually pass on watching any robot or superhero movie but I had the chance to watch Infinity Wars. OMG! I was hooked and so we went to see Endgame. I have now doubled back to watch all of the prior films I missed so I understand each character. I am now a true fan of Marvel. Jus how much of a fan you might ask------I cried about Tony Starks.
1078,Yes I reviewed this already but people giving this movie less than 9 obviously aren't vested in these characters and are just to anti marvel to see just how good this movie was..... as far as being any kind realistic the movie starts with dear Mr fantasy.....
1079,Its the end of a era. A big goodbye. A rear Will fall and u Will leave the movie behind and stay heartbroken
1080,Well i loved the movie. I didn't even knew when did the three hour time passed because i was enjoying a lot. I am sure its worth of your time and money.thanks marvek for this grrat movie and i'd wanna say thank you to every actor who played this movie soo goood
1081,"One of the best movies I have seen in a long time, I never really got into MCU movies but after watching this I've been obsessed"
1082,"Yes, I know it's blasphemy for some people, but after so much build-up and so much hype; Endgame met every expectation I had and exceeded them, which I can say was not an easy feat. The story was brilliant, as many people have said, it was not as tightly-woven as Infinity War's, but that doesn't detract much from the experience. The three hours flew by, and I had a grin on my face at every turn. The jokes landed fine and the emotional moments were, well, emotional. It is a very hard task to beat Infinity War, yet Endgame did it for me.This movie does indeed have a lot of fan service, but that is absolutely not a negative for me, especially since some of it was fantastic to see play out. My favourite part, like most, was The Avengers' Assembly. The music was brilliant throughout the film, and here the crescendo and the triumphance of the Avengers theme by Alan SIlvestri could not be matched. Thus follows the best action scene in the film and in my opinion, the best in the MCU. It was great and mind-blowing to see.Of course, the ensuing battle eventually results in Tony Stark's final ""I am Iron Man"" and a snap to end Thanos and his army. The man who started it all is gone. The movie did excellently with the character reactions from Rhodey, Peter and Pepper and their acting, along with Robert Downey Junior's, was phenomenal. The funeral and credits were suitably heart-breaking and were crafted expertly. The Russos did a great job at making it seem jubilant and melancholy at the same time. The end of an era. There is so much to talk about that I did not get to, but I commented on the best bits, and you most likely have seen it by now and can make a judgement for yourself. I will definitely continue seeing the MCU's next entries until the day I die or the day they stop and I am not going to avoid the future instalments because this Infinity Saga is over. I will instead look forward to what the future of the MCU holds, as I doubt it will ever get uninteresting. We will have to wait and see. Go watch this movie, even if you aren't a Marvel fan (as they have no doubt seen it multiple times already like I have), it is worth your time as it is a once in a lifetime experience and no way near a disappointment."
1083,"Anyone who complains about this film has not appreciated the last 10+ years of Marvel cinematic creation. Apparently everyone is a ""genius"" and those that have been working on these movies for this long are idiots. This was the best and most perfect way to end the Infinity War Saga. They blew everything out of the water and delivered exactly what fans needed and wished for. Those that apparently have been writing movies from their couches fo their entire lives while sipping on mama's kool aid need to check themselves. What blows my mind more than the movie is the fact that there are actually people griping about it and finding every reason to whine and moan about something that you never could dictate - so why bother wasting so much time? It was good. It may end up being the highest grossing film of all time. That says enough."
1084,I think this movie is even better than infinity war! It feels balanced (as all things should be!) and you really feel a connection with the characters. It also has a lot of humour.
1085,"I think it's the best avengers film and Doctor Strange's return was so awesome, it's really good movie"
1086,The best marvel movie till date ... simply an epic I mean it is an epic.
1087,"A movie that is going to be with me for a lifetime..!! Blown away, amazing>>!!"
1088,"Total closure for an Era. Seeing all my heroes so humane, so real brought me inner peace. When Cap tells ALL Earth's heroes to assemble I felt anyone, me, should have been there to fight as one."
1089,"Really good movie, my kind of movie overall. I love Thors hippie style <3"
1090,"Avengers: Endgame takes place after the grave events of Avengers: Infinity War(2018). The world is in shambles, after Thanos(Josh Brolin) succeeds with his nefarious plan. All the remaining Avengers reunite to stop Thanos, no matter what the consequences.Avengers: Endgame is a mind-blowing film. Directors Anthony Russo & Joe Russo have given us an absolutely satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga, which consists of all 22 Marvel Cinematic Universe movies which have released, so far. The emotional moments make you shed a tear or two. Don't worry though. The comedic moments are aplenty, as well. The effortless chemistry & the banter among all the Avengers, remains intact. The action set pieces are glorious. The climactic set piece is the highlight of the film. You will cheer till you no longer can, as so many moments will bring you pure & unadulterated joy! The visual effects are brilliant. The 3D is eye-popping. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Mark Ruffalo is fantastic as Bruce Banner/Hulk. Chris Hemsworth is incredible as Thor. Scarlett Johansson is unforgettable as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Jeremy Renner is superb as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. Don Cheadle is effective as James Rhodes/War Machine. Paul Rudd is amazing as Scott Lang/Ant-Man. Brie Larson is awesome as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Karen Gillan is awe-inspiring as Nebula. Danai Gurira is impressive as Okoye. Bradley Cooper is hysterical as Rocket. Josh Brolin is flawless as Thanos. The supporting cast is scene-stealing in their respective roles. Avengers: Endgame is a must watch. Go & experience this action-packed, hilarious, emotional & wholesomely entertaining rollercoaster ride of a film. My all-time favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe movie & the best superhero film, of all time. Absolutely jaw-dropping stuff!"
1091,"When I saw Endgame, it was totally worth the two hour wait. It was beautifully told and while we said goodbye to some of the best characters ever, it was still a masterpiece."
1092,With some misfortunes but an amazing script and a wonderful interpretation of part of the actors
1093,The perfect ending to a series. I left the theater wanting it not to end even know it answered all questions and closed the series off.
1094,"Awesome movie, very epic. I advise everyone to see it."
1095,"I think i have never laughed or cried as much as i did when i saw this film. It's the end of an era. Even though i loved this film there are some elements that i didn't like which were fat thor, they way hulk was treated and that there was barely any action throughout the first 2 hours of the film. Despite these flaws i still really enjoyed this film and i recommend you to watch it again."
1096,"This movie as an absolute masterpiece. I saw some reviews that are concerned with filling plotholes such as how (SPOILERS) Steve Rogers was able to go back in time and live a normal life, but it is clear in the movie that he had a pym particle that he used to go back, and quantum physics explains the rest of it. (Spoilers over) Also the sfx makeup is really good, so if you're into that, watch the movie and just sit and admire it."
1097,"I saw ""Avengers: Endgame"", starring Robert Downey Jr.-the Sherlock Holmes movies, The Shaggy Dog_2006; Chris Evans-Gifted, The Losers; Scarlett Johansson-Rough Night, We Bought a Zoo and Josh Brolin-Dead Pool 2, Men in Black 3.
This is the conclusion of last years' Infinity War-2018-and it is a nice trip down memory lane. The story line involves time travel, so past scenes from previous movies are seen-hence the trip down memory lane. Stan Lee has his last cameo in one of those time travel scenes and he is digitally de_aged to look younger. Robert, Chris, Scarlett and the rest of the surviving Avengers are left to deal with the aftermath of Josh's finger snap-remember, it wiped out half of the population in a blink of an eye-as they try to some how restore order to the universe. It's been 5 years and nobody has come up with a plan. Things are looking bleak. If you have ever read any comic books, you know things have a way of working out but there are consequences. That's what makes a good story. It's best if you don't know too much before seeing the movie, but I can tell you that there are some fantastic fight scenes, lots of humor and you get to see people like you've never seen them before-at least not in the MCU movies. And, there are casualties. There is not any surprise scenes during or after the end credits, however, the original 6 Avenger actors' autographs are shown when their names appear on screen.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi violence and action and language and has a running time of 3 hours & 1 minute-so make sure you hit the restrooms before the movie.
I really enjoyed this movie and I would buy it on Blu_Ray."
1098,"After spending 10 years investing into a franchise such as Marvel and seeing its final product, I'd have to say it was satisfying and heartbreaking. Yes, we know future films are coming out after this, but to focus on what is at hand here is the point. It was worth going to the opening weekend show at 2am on a Friday morning. If i had to critique as being unbiased I will say it is a bit longer than needed, but when you watch it doesn't seem as though it was. Everything moved together, but for those who have seen, the time traveling can be a bit confusing to some (myself included) just because they found a way to leave some stories open for the future films. Was proud to be a part of watching wonderful experience and film!"
1099,"This movie just tops off a 10/11 year story in a fantastic way!
This films gives gives you laughs, sad moments and excitement moments. It is truly is a piece of genius. (The Russos should of directed the last season of GOT)
Hats off to all the people involved in this story actors, directors and all the people behind the scenes. A special thanks to RDJ and Chris Evans. These guys deserve an Oscar.
I truly hope the next phase of films continues to the high standards set in the past 10 years."
1100,"Avengers Endgame: ReviewBlockbusters like this only come once in a generation. After the epic Infinity War Marvel opted for a more melancholy film. One where the heroes we had connected to lost.The Characters:
Our characters are broken. Destroyed by their failures from the previous film and trying to cope with what happened. Each heroes coping mechanism is different and fallows the characterization all ready established in the other films. Building off what was already established in previous films.
For me Hawkeye is one of the best characters in the film. His ark is set up from scene one. He starts and what he believes as someone who is unredeemable. Then gets a shot at redemption and thinks he will sacrifices himself for the crimes he committed. Instead it was Natasha who ends up sacrificing herself. Now with this new found purpose to live and keep going. This is helped through Jermy Renners acting. His acting throughout helps create as strong emotional core of the film.Acting:
Similar to Infinity War the acting is top notch. Standouts are Karen Gillian as Nebula and Robert Downy Jr. as Iron Man. All the acting is great, from the comedic Thor, to the understated Black Widow who is trying to redeem herself in this new world.Direction:
Joe and Anthony Ruso had there work cut out for them. They directed the film exquisitely creating iconic shots and emotionally impacting moments. The film can do dramatic and make it interesting to look at and watch. The action as well is amazing and similar to the massive battles from Lord Of The Rings.Writing and Story:
If you spent at least 5 minutes on the internet after infinity war you probably saw someone's theory. Every theory out there was wrong but not better than the film we got (something that The Last Jedi suffered from in some peoples opinion).
The smart snappy comedy that the MCU is known for is throughout and helps make the films not all a depressing movie that isn't entertaining.
The writing also do great at subverting audience expectations. Going in a direction that wasn't expected. This is shown perfectly in the first few minutes. Everyone expects the heroes to use the stones and bring all the dead hero's back. Instead the heroes have to wait to get there redemption.Ending A Franchise:
Ending a series in a satisfying and fulfilling ending is hard. But when done right is magical. Look at Return Of The King the film was the end of the LOTR series in a satisfying way. Endgame does this to giving an ending to the story of Tony Stark and Steve Rodgers in a satisfying and conclusive ending. Bring the ending that no one expected and didn't feel rushed.Conclusion:
The film is a blockbuster of the highest caliber. One of both emotion and action bringing everything together in a satisfying conclusive way.Final Score:
11/10"
1101,I love it the bast avengers movie of all the times
1102,I loved this last installment great movie for people that haven't seen this on e your going to be thrilled about it but it will shock you as well.
1103,"An amazing movie, emotional, funny and with so much action! One of my favourite movies! It is worth watching! You have to see it!"
1104,"The film was jam packed with emotion, action, and struggles throughout as the film progresses. It was worth the wait and I have no doubt any big MCU fan would NOT be disappointed!"
1105,We can't say anything to this awesome work these russo brothers did the work very perfect
1106,"I've been a big fan of Marvel, for a long time. So believe me when I say, this is my favorite movie of all time. It could use some work, but hey it deserves a ten even if it should probably be a nine or eight. Watch the movie you'll enjoy it."
1107,"Even though it isn't a happy ending for some but as Robert Downey jr. aka Tony Stark said it doesn't always roll on that way. Part of the journey is the end. No journey is complete without an ending, and Avengers: Endgame brought to the infinity saga the perfect one.We saw that the six initial Avengers (the OGs) have evolved each in his own way. Indeed, Tony Stark who's gone from a selfish playboy to a hero who sacrificed his life for the survival of mankind, and he's become a very lovable and protective father and husband. Steve Rodgers has shown us that he is worthy of lifting Mjolnir ( as we would have expected since his scene in Avengers: Age of Ultron where he is trying to lift the hammer and was the closest to succeed ) and by doing so, it shows us that Dr. Abraham Erskine was right all along: Captain America is really pure of heart. Also, by going back in time to continue living his life where he stopped and had this dance with his One is a special and emotional scene. It gives to the character a well deserved and peaceful retirement. He couldn't have missed his date for much longer after all. Now Thor, as we all know, went through a lot of pain; his path wasn't the easiest. Indeed losing most of his people, had his family killed ( except Odin who died peacefully ) and the idea of losing against the mad titan made the god of thunder miserable. But after his confrontation with his now dead mother, and some pep talk offered by Rocket, he regained hope. In addition, by lifting his old hammer we can see that Thor was still worthy even after he battled with anger and depression. Hulk has gone from a wild, angry uncontrollable beast to a more intelligent and sentimental one. Bruce Banner finally gained control over the monster inside of him. The story of Natasha Romanoff is a sadder story, in fact she turned from a lone wolf to a wolf who works better with a pack. If you didn't get my metaphor, Black Widow didn't trust anybody. She was always vigilant with the others. But the Avengers gave her a family, they were the only people she could trust. So sacrificing her self for the better good of her new familia is a huge changing for the character. And at last but not at least Clint Barton aka Hawkeye aka Ronin. He turned from a caring father to an assassin who's gone rogue. After his family turned to dust, his only goal was killing bad guys, but when hope came knocking to his door he was ready to sacrifice himself to bring his family back."
1108,"While Endgame is not necessary the greatest movie ever, what it accomplishes Is arguably the greatest feat ever pulled in film. To take the plots from 21 different movies and combine them into one three hour slot in a way that makes sense is incredible. Almost every single hero from the movies, no matter how minor, is included, and Marvel somehow manages to further develop the characters of almost every hero, which, again, is a mammoth feat for a three hour film. There is a clear path each character was on since the cinematic universe began, and they stay on their path through the end of this movie.As far as this movie by itself goes, it has the typical humor of a Marvel movie that may not please everyone, but it is not reliant on that humor and certainly has stretches where it allows tension to build without any comic relief. While some people may be displeased about the use of time travel in this film, it is much better than the easier alternative, which would have essentially been another battle with Thanos for the movie, resulting in little character development. Through the time travel, characters can explore their past and continue to develop through meaningful interactions with their past selves. For those people who dislike how un-scientific time travel seems, this is a super hero movie, not a documentary. It isn't supposed to be based on science. After they arrive back to the present, the battle scene begins. As all of the resurrected heroes arrive at the scene, viewers will get goosebumps. There is no better way Marvel could have demonstrated what they accomplished than having everyone together at once, battling evil. It is truly one of the most awe-inspiring scenes in film history.
There was only one real issue with the movie, which happens when all of the female heroes teamed up to protect the Infinity Stones. While this obviously carries a good message, it feels much too forced and comes across as an effort for political correctness rather than actually sending a message. The abilities of all the female superheroes on their own already carry that message in a much more natural way.
Overall, it is best to just step back and look at what Marvel has accomplished over the last 10+ years, and how they managed to pulpit off successfully. Just look at what DC is trying to do with its own universe right now to see how this can all go so wrong very easily. Marvel has managed to create a universe larger than any other film series ever (including Star Wars), filled with twists and turns and built to continue in the future (there are, after all, thousands of superheroes in this universe). While it certainly is not in the taste of film critics, this movie deserves to win awards because there will not be another film for a very long time that tells a story anywhere near the magnitude that this one does."
1109,"This movie has all things in it...Emotions,comedy and class acting...MCU has done beautiful culmination of the previous 21 movies...it should become the highest grossing movie ever..Direction,visual effects and cinematography were all mind blowing..Absolutely a winner👍"
1110,"Started dark but really brought the story together, worth the wait but now we feel empty that the series is over!"
1111,"Avengers Endgame was the end of an era, 22 movies made to get a big legendary resolution on this one. As a huge Marvel fan, I could not be more grateful for this movie, they focused on the original six avengers and brought a massive nostalgia to the fans who have been following this journey for the past 11 years.
When I watched Avengers Endgame for the first time, it was the most surreal movie experience I had ever had. Everyone in the movie theater was screaming, crying, celebrating and clapping, I could easily compare it to reactions we get on World Cup Finales. Definitely a experience to remember, and it proves how much this movie touched our hearts!
The characters get an epic ending, even though some of them didn't get the happiest one. It concluded a enormous saga and started a new one. Marvel did a fantastic job and it's a movie you'll feel lots of different emotions, but on a whole, you'll feel proud of being part of something as big as the Avengers."
1112,Just watched avengers endgame for the second time (still watching the credits) and the first 2/3 made so much more sense!! Been about 6 weeks since I last seen it and I loved it then too! (More so the fight scenes but now I've gotten much more clarity on those marvel Easter eggs!! Very well executed and very smartly orchestrated too!!
1113,"A love letter to everything the MCU has built since 2008. Thanks Kevin Feige, Thanks Joe and Anthony Russo !!"
1114,"Now that it is is gone from theaters, I am finally making a review. It still does contain spoilers though. I love how there was many plots like Thor in 2013 Asgard, Iron Man and Cap America in 1970 New Jersey, and other funny stuff. It was worth watching for hours. As usual in these movies, it ends in an epic battle where everyone fights. Thanos (who died twice) and all his army get snapped in the end. We get some sad scenes, like Iron Man's funeral, but we do get some scenes where everybody is happy. Best movie ever."
1115,"This movie was actually a 11/10, but I have to make it balanced."
1116,"This movie is great and is the perfect ending for og avengers. Not as good as infinity war but not by a long shot. This movie feels long. each of the 3 acts are different, which is not a bad thing.The 1st act feels like a slow, emotional, post apocalyptic movie after Thanos's snap. Thanos's death (when Thor chops his head off) was a nice twist and Tony's daughter was really cute but during Tony's funeral she looked like she didn't care. just why. Your dad just died you show at least give a damn.The 2nd act is just fan service, but earned fan service. Cap v cap was a nice fight scene but I thought the editing could have been better but whatever (apparently there was gonna be thor v thor as well but they cut it out because they thought cap v cap already did its job and they didn't need another one, but i disagree fat thor v normal thor would have been hilarious) the elevator scene was nice but while watching it i kept thinking ""are they gonna fight?"" And they didn't. When tony talked to his dad I cried. When Fat thor (who is great in this movie) talks to his mom its a good scene and when HES STILL WORTHY was also a good scene. The guardians of the galaxy parts were kinda boring especially the bits with blue girl. All bits with ant man are good fyi. Professor hulk (who i also like) got the time stone pretty easy. Black Widows death I saw coming but i was still sad when it happened I almost cried but I didn't because Im tough.The 3rd act is the best part of the movie. When hulk snapped I new he was gonna survive because he still have one more movie after this but the scene was still amazing. The bombing of avengers headquarters was really funny to me, I don't know why. When thors hammer started moving i thought caps totally gonna pick it up and he did (yaaay). The portals scene was perfect. After hulks snap hawkeyes mom calls instead of everyone coming out of a portal which was pretty nice. When iron man died i cried. The funeral was a really good scene. And there's alot more I probably forgot to mention but the movies 3 hours long.But there was one problem keeping this from being better than infinity war and it was Thanos. He really dragged this movie down he was bland as bread but i like bread and I don't like Thanos in this movie compared to infinity war. In infinity war Thanos was a really good character with a unique motivation. In endgame his motivation is terrible.Anyway i could go on and on about Thanos's crap motivation but this is getting to long so in conclusion i like this movie and I think its a satisfying conclusion to 10 year saga"
1117,This movie is really nice.this movie has both emotional and funny moments.The most emotional scene was when ironman died and black widow as well.I love you 3000
1118,"Before walking into the theater I thought of a dozen different ways this movie could possibly play out, but it was none of those. It progresses in a make-sense but surprising fashion that I've never seen in any other movies. Not to say it doesn't have plot holes, but I happily embrace it because I honest believe no one could've done a better job in writing the story. Great job Marvel and thank you for pulling this off!"
1119,"The movie kept me excited and entertained for the whole 3 hours. There was not a moment of me taking my focus of the movie, and that's what good movies do."
1120,"I actually saw Avengers: Endgame the first day itself and lost my voice for a week, but I'm reviewing it now because I've seen it today in 3D 4DX, the best version of a 3D movie having talking rats and purple giants. And about the movie, it is 3 hours of satisfying nods and callbacks to our beloved MCU movies, and every second of every MCU movie has built up to this excruciatingly awesome, epic, gargantuan conclusion which is worth every bit of hype. I'm not gonna say anything about the story because, believe me, you don't wanna know it. And Robert Downey Jr. deserves the Oscar for the best actor. The directors and the screenwriters have done a splendid job giving the most satisfying conclusions to Tony Stark's and Steve Rogers' character arcs. Special shoutout to Alan Silvestri for his electrifying and goosebump-inducing music, I almost had a cardiac arrest with his music. This movie is the best of the best movies, the very best. Thank you, Marvel. Thank you, the Russo brothers, Thank you Stan Lee, and Thank you, Robert Downey Jr. for entertaining us for these 11 years. We and the universe will surely miss Tony and Steve. We love you 3,000, Marvel! Thanks!"
1121,"It's too slow and there's lack of action in the movie, I think they focused more on story line and all , but it's a good movie."
1122,The best marvel movie ever.. It was epic!! You'll enjoy every moment of the 3hr2min movie. All I can say is.. We love you 3000 AVENGERS!!
1123,"Cheesy and dumb. They could have done so much with this movie, but completely failed. There was WAY to much comedy and PC moments. Definitely a waste of time and money."
1124,"A beautiful ending to a legendary story. No spoilers from me, a must watch. 100,000,000/10"
1125,"Avengers: Endgame (5 out of 5 stars).Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent awesome superhero film that concludes the infinity stones storyline that has been building up with 22 movies in the Marvel universe. They had done a great job building up each solo character and have there films bring something new and exciting. Endgame is the game changer that delivers the ultimate climax of the story arc with the big bad Thanos (Josh Brolin) going up against the Avengers. After the previous film Infinity War leaving the audience hanging with the cliffhanger. Marvel has done a great job in marketing and keeping this film spoilers free with the trailers that only show the same footage and very minimum. Which I will say it is best to see the film knowing very little about what is going to happen.I will try to keep this review spoiler free. Endgame is amazing and spectacular. Joe and Anthony Russo direction was fantastic and they did a great job in delivering a spectacular climax of the MCU. The plot was amazing. For a three hour long film. The film does move pretty fast and kind of feels short when watching it. I did feel like Endgame is a little short on the action set pieces like the previous films. Which this film does focus more on the emotional connections with the original Avengers like Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) and how they were all affected by the aftermath of Infinity War. The film does have a lot of fun and feels like a wild adventure with what these characters go through. The final hour delivers all out with an epic climax which every character has a moment to shine. And makes up for the lack of action in the movie. I love how every hero works with another when fighting there enemy. There were some moments where you will be in an awe and clapping moment with the climatic battle sequence. The visual effects are top notch great. There is some fun humor that will lighten the mood of the film. And there are some tear jerking moments that will leave you feeling happy and sad at the same time. The directors did a wonderful job in surprising the audience with something new and reaching every characters full potential. The climatic fight scene with Thor, Cap America, and Iron Man teaming up and bouncing around with there super powers are just awesome. The surprises do keep on coming throughout. Which will leave you feeling satisfied.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. The plot was amazing and fast moving. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited. The cast ensemble was great. I will say this is one fun wild ride that I am happy how it ties the story arc together."
1126,Enjoyed film . 3d is good.
1127,Marvel needs to shorten movies to 2 hours. Movie was way too long...
1128,In trying too hard Marvel have actually ruined what could have been a perfect end to their storyline and a wonderful start to prequels for certain characters. This movie was soo long unnecessarily that it has put me off from watching another Marvel movie again with the exception of Black Panther and Spider-Man.
1129,"No Thanoscopter
No Thank You
Get your stuff together Marvel"
1130,"If the film is viewed as a separate film then it is excellent in every respect, but since that is not the case then the film is mildly said to be a failed case. First I missed it with infinity war. A lot of mistakes that were not allowed to happen. Hulk, who during the whole series of avengers is unbeatable and who is beaten more and more becomes stronger and stronger, he is the greatest weakman, and also the vision that at that moment was the most powerful member of their family. I can understand that Tanos was extremely dominant about the stones, but the fact that the person who wrote the script was a lot of work, and then they made so many illogicalities that do not happen in children's films, for such a film is extremely bad. Then hopes fell on the end game. Hoping that at least a portion of these errors will be corrected and made a much better film that follows all the previous happenings in the entire series of Avenger, Iron Men, Torah ... did not happen. The opposite happened. They made many more errors than they could ever make. I'll only include a couple of extreme errors. The first who watched the Guardians of the Galaxy meant that then it was said that no mortal can hold infinity stones, let alone use it, and here they played with them as with clicks. Suddenly, the captain of America becomes the god of lightning, is it realistic that you did it, and after all, I do not know why Tanos needed stones at all when he threw them out of stone as a toy, if we already found out that the hula was beaten because he had a stone at that time power, what did he have now? Again I emphasize the film about the special effects and from the technical side fantastic and that it is completely separate from me would get a grade 10. This way, on my part, it can only get a score of 1."
1131,"... and what let down! Slow to develop and fast and furious action in the end. The whole story line was awful and the ending pretty much may have been the ""endgame"" for me, in watching it any further. You may have to watch it to understand the future development - with new heros and old ones gone - but this has now become more of a ""transformer"" type kid series. So bye, bye for me."
1132,"After Infinity Wars, this is what utter disappointment feels like. Lazy, shoddy writing, a story full of plot holes that are inevitable with time travel, incomprehensibly misguided story lines (Thor, Hulk, the hammer, easily created new gauntlets, Thanos, Black Widow's death an afterthought while Tony Stark gets a 20 minute funeral, a wasted Captain Marvel, a botched final battle), and boring, so boring. I noticed people around me checking the time on their phones or going to be the bathroom because nothing was happening.And it could have been so simple: The basic plot could have been the careful planning and carrying out of the killing of Thanos (who still has all the stones, because why would he destroy them?) on his planet. The Team failed last time, but this time they have Captain Marvel, and that's the game changer. You succeed. Two hours, nice, clean, tight script with no inexplicable plot points. At the end Captain America could die because mission accomplished, Tony retires and gets his family, Widow and Hawkeye rebuild their lives - and Shield - together, Antman has his daughter, Thor and Captain Marvel become an item. With Hulk, Nebula and Rocket, they become the new Avengers. Mourn the dead. Celebrate the living. Rebuild the world.There you go, I rewrote your story in 10 minutes. A thousands times better."
1133,"If you've been loving the MCU films recently, then this will probably be your favorite one yet. It's absolutely jammed packed with material, and the more MCU films you've seen, the better it'll be.However, the movie is dragged down by an extensive runtime, and jokes that miss the mark. Endgame takes too long to get going, and then seemingly never ends. And most of the humor is hit or miss; it just feels out of place.Overall, Endgame wraps up the Avengers ark reasonably well, but it's too arrogant and lacks any real sense of quality."
1134,"I saw Endgame Friday night. I might be a minority of one, but I hated it (and I am a big Marvel fan). The rules of time travel made absolutely no sense and were completely ad hoc, the tugs on the heart strings were gratuitous - a ritualistic bow to the currently fashionable trope that ""the stakes must be raised and there must be consequences"" - it's a comic book movie, for crying out loud! If I want to be depressed I can just read the newspaper! Modern filmmakers and script writers are embarrassed by straightforward happy endings and good triumphing over evil, even in superhero movies - witness the abomination that was ""Batman v. Superman"" or the way the recent Star Wars movies have completely undone the happy ending of ""Return of the Jedi"" (Han and Leia are divorced, Han's son kills his father, Luke is a bitter old hermit, etc.). The Russo brothers even said that they wanted their Avengers movies to be ""mature storytelling"" with ""real stakes"" and ""real consequences"" - i.e., ""we are going to kill off some beloved characters."" Part of it is simply vanity (""I don't make kids' movies - I engage in mature storytelling""), but part of it is also a form of nihilistic cultural pessimism. It 's the same pessimism that makes it impossible for the heroes of any show to have a stable, solid romantic relationship like Jonathan and Jennifer in the old ""Hart to Hart"" TV show. Now it's all about the unresolved sexual tension stringing along the viewers for years, from ""Moonlighting"" to ""Lois and Clark"" to ""Castle"" to ""Lucifer."" I also thought that the treatment of Thor as a caricature and a figure of comic relief verged on the obscene considering the aloof nobility of the character as he was initially conceived by Stan Lee. As for the time travel plot holes, I think the writers needed to use time travel to undo Thanos' ""snap"", but they also wanted real consequences and real deaths that couldn't be undone (at least for the time being - you never know with superhero fiction!) So they decided that the heroes would go back in time to retrieve the Stones in order to undo the ""snap"", but they also told us that going back in time would not change their present in the universe in which the action is taking place, except that it might create new timelines every time somebody interacts with the past,as the Ancient One tells Banner. If events other than the snap can't be undone (as they kept telling us), then the heroes created all sorts of new timelines even if they put the stones back at the time they first stole them: Howard Stark got a pep talk about parenting he wouldn't have gotten otherwise, Cap found out that Bucky was alive, etc. Most confusingly, was there a Steve Rogers married to Peggy Carter and a Steve Rogers frozen in ice at the same time in whatever timeline Cap created when he chose to stay in the past? And if so, what happened when Cap #1 was thawed out?The movie will probably make a ton of money, but it is a disappointing end to what had been a great run of movies"
1135,"SPOILERS
So, 22 films. 11 years. When I walked out of IW I didn't know how marvel was gonna top this movie. But they did. Goddamnit such a beautiful film. Love it a 3000"
1136,"This movie is so good that I literally began to shake in the final battle (adrenaline rush) in fact I almost pissed myself. Not because I wanted to go to the toilet but because of the thrill, shock and excitement throughout. Be prepared."
1137,"*Packed with MANY spoilers*Let's get real. This movie was so massive, but it has sooo many plotholes! Make no mistake I love Marvel, but this movie was not the best that's out there from the MCU. I loved how the movie pays homage to the previous films, I thought that was quite clever. But I personally expected way more action earlier in the movie.Thanos snapped half the universe in IW. But we didn't really get to SEE the direct impact on Earth in this movie. No chaos. No news. Just a ... quiet depressed world? Really? I wanted to feel anxious and feel like all hope is lost but it never really got there. Even during collecting the stones from the previous timelines.The attack on Thanos in the opening scene was lame. This guy was meant to be a massive villain that the MCU has been building up for a decade, and his death was over in minutes. Captain Marvel's lack of screen time didn't make any sense, she's so powerful yet was hardly there. I get that the writers were focusing on the original 6 Avengers but there were scenes where it would have been interesting to see her in. Yes, this is the Avengers fight, but it's also Captain Marvels universe that has been affected, so not seeing her as involved as Ant-Man or Nebula was disappointing. Oh and obtaining the Soul stone... Nebula couldn't warn Black Widow and Hawkeye about what was coming? Seriously?? Not something you want to mention beforehand?How did Thanos's ship time travel without a) starks tech and b) the Pym Particle. HELLO THE SHIP WENT SUB ATOMIC INTO THE QUANTAM REALM AND TIME TRAVELLED. What did the 2014 Nebula do to make this happen? And no one noticed a massive ship come shooting out of the time machine and out of the Avengers base?!When Hulk reverses the snap... again we don't know the impact it had on Earth / the Universe. What actually happened? Was everything reset back to 2019, or were the people that turned to dust returned into a new time (5 years later?) and if so why was Peter back in highschool?? And what about the people that were already on Earth, were they also set back to a time right before everyone dissappeared? I guess we see Cassie (Ant-Man) all grown up at the end, but come on... this was a MASSIVE ISSUE and it was not explained in any way whatsoever. I get they wanted the dramatic entrance of the dusted superheroes, but even after the mega action scene at the end there was no explanation of how half the universe came back into life.The movie also never really showed us as an audience the 1 in 14 million ... chain of events that led to the win. Could anyone else have snapped their fingers and dusted away Thanos and his clan? Again... no proper explanation.Tony stark starting the MCU infinity saga and also ended it, perfect... and giving him the appropriate screen time at the end. What about black widow? Couldn't Hawkeye bring her body back? Couldn't someone else travel to where she was and get her body? They just left her there to die alone?For a 3 hour movie you'd expect more of closing story or better explanations, but instead time was wasted on a slow start to the movie. Nonetheless I still enjoyed this movie and it will come to grow on me more and more, but I'm always going to have these questions in the back of my mind every time I watch.Oh... and don't get me started on the time travel MESS."
1138,"I am immensely honoured to be existing in this monumental era of time to be able to experience the vast complexity and extravagance of the MCU, as it flourished with each subsequent film. It has been one hell of a ride, but unfortunately - all good things must come to an end... and this film met this end with great success."
1139,"Had a lot going on. Expected a lot more emotions to be evoked. Left me asking for more in a negative way.
Moved too fast. Other than the fight scene, which envoked the feel cause of its grandeur, nothing actually makes a lasting impact on you"
1140,First half was really boring. But the climax was really appreciated.overall it's not the Movie we want
1141,"The wrap-up to last's year Infinity War is a satisfying wellspring of closure to many of our Marvel faves as the battle against Thanos & his minions to save the universe & perhaps restore the lost lives that were disappeared when the snap heard around the universe was instituted. Not going into the outcomes of some characters or mucking about in spoilers, this effort by the Russo brothers is gargantuan in scope & intent as multiple storylines through 22 separate films comes to a head. Whether you come from your screening satisfied or frustrated, you must give heed to the Herculean effort attempted & accomplished. This is surely a film for the ages."
1142,"My rating is purely based on the ending. The movie was probably a 5 at best imo. There were cool parts of course, like Cap wielding the hammer, fat Thor, Ironman and some other stuff too.But the overall movie did not live up as far as I'm concerned. It never followed through with the epicness of the last one and it never lose enough from an emotional standpoint.Captain America deserved an honourable death, not becoming an old fart.Thor deserved to find himself after the depression, especially after meeting his mom and then die an honourable death too.Hulk deserved redemption after the awesome scared angle from Infinity war.Ironman got an awesome ending of course.Personally, I feel that ""Endgame"" should have provided more of an end - true finality - instead of continuously trying to build for the next Marvel run."
1143,I love this movie and it feels like the perfect conclusion to the infinity saga. I honestly would not have it done any other way.
1144,"If you waiting reality then this type of movie isn't for you. I watch for entertainment and to get out of reality for awhile and this movie was great for me and all who went with me. So ""Nay-Sayers"" maybe you should stay home and watch reality TV there. I loved this movie"
1145,"AE is the Final battle of Infinity Saga which concluded the story of every movie since 2008. The time travel explanation was good.It felt like Inception. The ending was the most fulfilling for Iron Man and Captain America. This movie couldn't have been better. The only problem with this movie was with the dubbed version in Hindi, they made the crap out of it, it was the worst dubbing ever. Please Marvel India take this into consideration. Love you 3000"
1146,"Saw this with my 2 sons who are huge avenger fans. We left the theater very disappointed. From my perspective this movie was rushed, bad acting and the same as the other. Re-watch the last avenger movie it's the same."
1147,They open the story and characters very widely so closing the chapter was a mess. Too much drama (poor one) main characters was missing. They gave role of Thor to captain america and hulk as carton green man. Worst avengers and really it's an end game (just a game).
1148,"Frank Capra had a golden rule - a movie can be many things but the number one sin is boring. Endgame - wanted to like it, spent money to like it, and .... boring. long, talkative and not worth the time. 2 hours would be fine, stretched to 3. Comedy was good mostly but not the padding. Long long intro shots of this and that. It finally hit the gold standard of DC. It took itself way way too seriously. So I am disappointed and sad. About right up there with Star Trek - The Motion Picture for boring. I don't like writing this, but ....... boring."
1149,"After GOT Battle of Winterfell, this movie just can't compete with its 20 minutes of battle. I found myself bored and wondering why it had soo many moments of cheap humor."
1150,I loved every minute of it but I hated that time travel stuff.
1151,I've always been a fan of comics either DC or marvel i was fan of both and supported both sides but to be honest The MCU is way better than the DCEU dont get me wrong but DC got a good future as i saw in aquaman and shazam but to see how all these 22 movies of the MCU just connect and reach its peak is just pure gold a great ending to a great era and i just can't wait what the phase 4 is going to bring us
1152,"But I want to try to bring the rating down because it does not deserve to be ranked among such movies as The Godfather and Twelve Angry Men.Ill start by saying the movie starts off really strong. Whenever you're dealing with time travel, there's it almost always going to end up messy. There's about a 45 minute stretch in here where the film isn't really coherent, and the way they choose to cover that is by distracting us with a humor, literally a joke every 10 seconds. After a certain point, the movie gets a lot better during the second half.Not as good or as tightly written as infinity war. I think everyone is raving over this movie because it's the end of the marvel franchise, and they did a good job at wrapping everything up. It is no where near one of the ""best movies of all time"" like everyone is saying."
1153,"I don't know where to start!!
Plot holes all the way through,
Two of the strongest Avengers might as well have not bothered! Thor and Hulk are rubbish in this movie. Danvers? Forget it. Saved tony smashed a ship, but Thanos can still throw her about?? So we travelled through the quantum realm, but had the time stone early..... why not use that? The Mjolnir and Caps Shield change of ownership just annoyed me. But my biggest Disappointment was how they didn't use Thor or Hulk. Hulk has been sold out massively in the MCU and it sucks. I could go on all day. The more I think about it, the less I like it. That's me done with Marvel now. RIP Stan Lee."
1154,"I love you three thousand times,when i was a student I fell in love with Iron Man.
sorry my English is not good, I can't express my feelings in words. 11 years ......Thank you.
My 11 years.
Perfect.
It's really done.
I love you three thousand times.
AVENGERS,ASSEMBLE."
1155,Everything a comic book fan can ask for and more. It is the most wonderful movie experience anyone can go to and the Russo's has done it all again. But somehow even better.
1156,"Next Level, Keep it up. amazing team, n amezing all roto artist"
1157,This movie was so amazing I love the adventure of searching and retrieving all the infinity stones I watched this movie 3 weeks ago and just now decided to write a review. The best bit was the ending war where everyone came and joined together to fight Thanos's army. 10 outta 10 the best movie i could have ever watched
1158,"How to ruin a masterpiece with a mediocre screenplay movie.
Lets go watch infinity war again and forget this one. We just watch 2 hours of comedy movie, and 30 minutes of classic marvel action sequence, and an end with a tragic death... and you rate this movie over a 9?
I think screenplay was made just for the fan, lets bring back everyone and kill few and everyone will be happy.
So be happy everyone."
1159,"Inevitably..It should become the highest grossing movie of all time...
#PART OF THE JOURNEY IS THE END
#IRONMAN
#we (the marvel fanbase all around the world) love you 3000"
1160,A masterpiece of cinematography and script writing.
1161,Sorry but this film was to long and boring for well over half of the film
1162,"A movie bigger than this has never been made or attempted. Critics who do not appreciate the movie or say its 'just another superhero movie' take this movie alone. This is NOT a standalone movie, its a closing to a spectacular franchise and it was satisfying on so many levels, I cant even explain.
There were so many moments in the movie that made one appreciate the depth of character, backstory,human bonding, sacrifice and ofcourse comedy and action, that I cannot even point them out even if I wanted to.To enjoy the movie, at least watch most of the MCU movies. This is the movie of the decade and you WILL ENJOY THIS"
1163,"Thanos had more understandable intentions for killing half the universe in the graphic novel and his intentions also made more sense but also made him seem eviler because he is literally in love with death and loves killing people because of that fact, I mean he's called the mad titan for a reason, you idiots working at Marvel. He's also named after the Greek god of death you stupid idiots all he wants to do is kill people literally. In this movie, however; and in infinity war Thanos is a big ugly bald crybaby and only wants to kill half the universe because he thinks that will stop overpopulation or some nonsense which it won't permanently the population will just go back to what it was eventually he solved nothing if he wanted to stop overpopulation he should have killed 100% of the universe's population along with the annoying guardians of the galaxy.
And then they just do a back to the future and resurrect everyone which is stupid and cliché and meaningless because no one died, nothing of value happened, nothing had a lasting impact for more than a few months blah blah blah they killed iron man thankfully, since he wan't the iron man that Stan lee and jack Kirby created in the 60's he was just a shell of man pun not intended (in case you didn't know his nickname is ole' shell head) this Iron Man helped ruin the last Spiderman movie but he will likely help ruin the next one too along with help from all the bad writing.
Also, Thanos' costume looks bad I hate how they have to make all the superhero costumes look more realistic or really more like pretentious modern art with weird textures. But back to the movie, it looks like it has over used CGI all marvel movies are just big cartoons with real actors in the old cartoons from the 90's and early 2000's looked better and the action looked realistic within the universe rather than jarring. Tired of the marvels they are all the same except infinity war where everyone's least favorite characters die exempt fake ant man as seen in this film, which is not as good because all the annoying characters come back."
1164,"I will not hear any criticism for this movie. It is perfect, and it made my heart soar with love and gratitude. When is the last time you watched a theater screen in awe? This is the best movie I've ever seen, and we are surely not to see it's like again any time soon. 10 years they took to build to this moment, and every single one paid off.Thank you, Marvel & Disney.
I love you 3000."
1165,Funny at times. Fair amount of action. No new character development (which made previous stories so strong). Inconsistent sci-fi theories (pick one and try to use it consistently) or explain it .... Thanos and Cap America seem to break the presented sci-fi time travel theory or why would you need to return stones to avoid a creating a mess. Why would Ironman's power source go out when he died? ) .Fair movie but far from great !!!!
1166,"2,5 hours of nonsense and gigantic plotholes. 15 minutes of action which is a total mess. CGI looks good, bit dark. Thor, one of the strongest badass characters in Marvel Universe is a drunk fat dude, does not make sense. Cap. America who can use Thors Hammer suddenly with lightning abilities, why? Cap. Marvel is OP, shows up randomly does huge amounts of damage and dissapears again list goes on and on... Iron man is the only character in this movie who deservers credits in my opinion. Infinity war is way better, its really overrated."
1167,"With the hype i just ran to watch the show on the second day itself... But it made me some anger in my nerves by the end..even its all fantasy there should be some justice for what they showing... Firstly whoever giving big hype please answer my following points..
1. In earlier version of avengers (infinity stones) thor was after creating a weapon to fight thanos and by the end he used it where thanos can resist it even with gauntlet stones power, here in this even without any gauntlet or stones the same weapon can do nothing ...just throwing here and there ,Thats it ! (now y did captain america can use it ! They desimatted the character thor , helpless powerless guy )
2. After all that fight with thanos all together, no one even cannot move the gauntlet from his hand (remember not single handed, tried by many characters all together in earlier version too) then how come tony stark can go and replace the gauntlet, that too single handed..(this is very important because its the main end scene of the fight)..atleast they could use support of captain marvel to make it more believable but they just thrown that character too away...
After all how come captain marvel and thor are powerless characters and iron man / captain america powerful characters ? Basically this movie is made for that !"
1168,"Nothing to tell,It's an Worst movie of all time in the entire Hollywood film industry."
1169,"This movie was pure trash, it was slow and lacking, it didn't have the climax that the Infinity war had. The male characters took all the spotlight throughout the entire movie. Captain Marvel barely had any limelight in the movie. Poor Natasha Romanov, the way she died, to me was very unfair, and Hawkeye became a rogue criminal, killing innocent people just because his family was gone.Really, like he was the only one loosing a family! In the other hand, Thanos was nothing but a dull villain with no solid purpose whatsoever.The plot was too rushed. One other thing was I didn't like how the Russo's brothers portrayed The Hulk in Endgame. I thought he was going to have a rematch with Thanos after loosing to him in Infinity war. A fat Thor! are you kidding me Marvel, one of the most powerful avengers and you made this guy look like the god of mommy issues! I tell you there were too many flaws in this movie. At the end I have to admit Deadpool was right, I don't want to see another Avengers movie."
1170,Anyone of Thor's fans wouldn't accept Marvel's adaptation of Thor. They ruined Thor this character just for making him as the funny elements of the film
1171,This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.
1172,"An all you can eat experience, but as most ""all you can eat"" restaurants the food quality is not the best. Shallow plot with many loopholes. Total waste of time."
1173,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me."
1174,"Avengers: End Game is long, boring, and predictable--with an endless amount of fan service. The humor in this movie just doesn't get a laugh. I cannot express how disappointed I am with the conclusion of 10 years of movies. I'm shocked this film is actually getting good reviews. This will be the last Marvel movie I see on opening night. I cannot help but think this is the beginning of the end for the MCU. It was good while it lasted."
1175,"Watched this on first day of opening. I was holding really high hopes, based on Infinity war, and i was really dissapointed. This movie has some good parts, and im ok with the final result, but the journey there was bad and really messed up. In general the whole movie felt like the main story is a couple of actors (and here i really mean actors, not theirs fictional characters) saying goodbye to marvel and mcu. Infinity war, Thanos, infinity stones, fate of universe, etc, seems just like a minor side story. Very, very sad waste of 3 hours."
1176,"The people how got these job got overwelmed and starter messing up every single thing, they stetched the movie to nowhere, leading to events that don't make any sense... true fans will feel that this was a kick in the stomach... I'm just disapointed.Simply a spit on Stan Lee's grave."
1177,"20 movies raised up my expectation from marvel, but the endgame was just a photo album of many actors and actresses who played in a movie with too much dialogues, minimum action scenes, childish plot, flat jokes and predictable events. I had two reservations for this weekend and canceled the other one as soon as I came of theater."
1178,What an amazing movie marvel have really use the power of it's own movie if every mistake in the others movie was just to give us these amazing moving picture then I will give all marvel movie he same rate.
1179,"I was really hoping to watch a good movie. I have seen all Marvel movies and was excited with the 10 star reviews. But this movie is basically garbage. A lot of characters doing random things. There was no interesting story line. The emotional scenes did not have any impact. The action scenes will leave you with a headache. What amazes me is people giving a 10 star, please be honest to yourself and rate correctly."
1180,"This movie provides us everything we ever wanted.
People who think the plot was messed up should know that The time travel made complete sense. The Russo's very convincingly
Used the theory of multiple parallel realities which was hinted quite a few times in the Ant-Man and Doctor Strange franchise movies.
Each of the original six avengers got their deserving screen time in the conclusion of the saga they started.
It was incredibly emotional yet funny. It gave fans pride, surprises and chills all the time. If you haven't yet seen the movie, you can never imagine what happens.
Killing thanos within the first 5 minutes, who could've imagined that. It also sets up the phase 4 of the MCU and is making the audience impatient for the next movie (Far From Home) to understand the consequences of the death of Tony Stark and Romanoff which was devastating but left their marks on each of our's hearts forever.
The final battle with the original six and the ressurected heroes made every marvel fan cry.
It was truly satisfying and unforgettable.
It was lovable 3000."
1181,"Story and the plot are the foundation of any movie and this film isn'tr very well in that matter. of course much superhero movies are like that however.It is obvious that we can expect things that are not rational compare to real world in sci-fi or fantasy movies so we measure them in compare to their own introduced logic. we accept some basic unnatural things and then we follow the new rules. Based on the rules the marvel universe has introduced us previously, End Game has too many holes. characters suddenly get very stronger than what they were seconds before or in compare to their history with no reason. Time traveling bugs like in all other time traveling movies present here as well. this happens also to emotional relationships between them. movie has too many cliche scenes with boring dialogs.when we compare this one to Infinity war, it is a huge disappointment. However, it is still worth watching and if you are a fan of Sci-fi, it entertains you. It is just an average superhero movie."
1182,"Don't waste your money. Watch it at home. It's the worst avengers movie there is. Even ""the week of Ultron"" was better than this. A 12 year old could've written a better ending. Forced everything. 1st half is too slow and the 2nd half is too disappointing. I am not going to the cinema to watch ""Avengers"" for a reality check and get a headache. I am going there to get entertained. This wasn't even least entertaining. This was bloody depressing."
1183,"The 10/10 reviews baffle me. HOW on earth? People using words like Perfect Amazing Brilliant need their heads wobbled. It's the worst marvel film made, with more plot holes than Swiss cheese, insulting the intelligence of real fans.
I'd like to hear what Ruffalo, Hemsworth and Downey Jr feel about having marvel screw their characters over like they did."
1184,I don't like character thor and hulk and more Drama
1185,"After Infinity war I thought we would get a epic conclusion. That is no where near the case. I have no clue what the people rating it 10 watched, there must be two versions. This one movie pretty much ended my love of marvel films. And will be my likely be my last. Terrible writing ruined and killed off beloved charters. I like how Captain America was handled. But wrong person got shield. The movie was 2 and a half hours of garbage. With 30 minutes of ok action. Had a couple good moments but that's about it. What a huge let down from everyone involved. Save your money wait for it on Redbox."
1186,"This movie is a screw up for all the movies.This scenario of Time Machine changes the whole concept of the world or the Marvel Universe.If the good guys or super heroes can multiple times change the past, then why can't the bad guys or villains.Of course the heroes return back the item so that, they do not to change the time line.Let's talk about what could happen if Thanos or some mad evil scientist do something far more evil deed in the universe with the use of Time Machine.By chance kill Adam and Eve so that they kill all human existence.
Or
Something far greater Sevier he goes on to all planets or universe and kill the first born or species.And so destroys the whole universeNow let's get back to Marvel film.
Since we are talking about Time Machine. There will be all the time 2 people exactly the same, one from that period of time {(for marvel Endgame Movie) past} person and the (Future) person.Captain America (future) goes back in the past and marries Peggy Carter and stays in the past also gets back his unbroken shield to Sam Wilson.
Doesn't this tamper with the past. Having an extra human being also with the actual Captain America Shield. If means the (past) Captain America doesn't have the Shield.Also Nebula (future) kills the (past) Nebula. Doesn't this erase herself from existence. As without the past self, the future self cannot live on.There was also a scene where Iron Man and Ant Man steals the Space Stone.
So a secured and lock briefcase opens with a drop to the ground, without any force. Also Loki disappeared with the Space Stone in 2012 which will also cause problem with the time vortex. As something happened that weren't suppose to happen.Also the Avengers all get their stones without any hassle or fight. Something spicy should have been added.
What I mean is new villain or ""Jarves"" should have turned up the alarm for intruders. etc."
1187,I had higher expectation from this movie but it turned out to be superheroes drama/comedy mixed with little action. There was very little action in the movie compare to past Avengers. 3d effects were not up to mark either. I was fairly disappointed by this one. If drama is your genre then go for it but if you like action then skip it.
1188,"Waited for the endgame ever since I left the theatre after infinity war. I really wanted to enjoy the movie, I even cheered for all the cliche stuff that was shoved in the film as what you would call fan service. But what the writers did to the fans was really disrespectfull. They wrote off all the heroes whose contract is done with marvel in the most rediculous way possible. Oh make hulk all green , sacrifice black widow for no reason, make captain America old, uselessly old, and please don't get me started on the unnecessary killing of Iron man the God father of the what so called Marvel Cinematic universe. They wanted us to give up Our old heroes to make way for their new ones, but just because we are fan they can manipulate us the way they want, but just because we are fans this is the one thing we won't do. It's not easy for a fan to let go of his hero and move on. We deserve a better end than that, their heroes deserve a better end than that insult. For heaven sake even Loki deserve a better ending than that. As a fan I was ready to allow all the none sense the story had, but insult me and take away my favorite hero and I will eat you alive. I will allow the whole concept of time travel thing, but let's go through the logic they had to fix everything. They would go back in time and steal the stones from different timelines bring them to the future snap their fingers bring everyone back, okay after that it gets stupid they will return the stones back right when they took them, wait won't that be putting the stones for Thanos to take again in his own timeline to snap his fingers and repeat the loss AGAIN. Why wouldn't they just go to the past destroy one of the stones once and for all. That would have at least saved black widow. Why would iron man snap his fingers why didn't he use the power of the stones and kicked Thanos ass at least that would have given us the satisfaction of revenge. How did Thanos get all the pym particles to get almost all his planet on earth through time travel in quantum realm when the avengers themselves had only enough for ONE ROUND TRIP. Where did the Asgardians come from. Didn't Thanos destroy their whole ship in the start of infinity war. How did the valkirey get her white horse for heaven sake have some respect for our heads and what good did the flying horse do really Nothing. Why make Thor this miserable and useless, that's not fair to his fans at least, why give him 5 minutes chat with his mother when it does nothing to his morals or affect the story at all. Same for the starks father son meeting absolutely meaningless. Where was Thor and iron man when Thanos beat the hell out of captain America, sleeping ?!! The end fight scene was terrible in the least. Single fight no unity at all even though they were all there and what became of Thanos they did better fighting him when he had the stones now that he is without them he becomes invincible why?!! Just to kill away Iron man?!! And don't get me started on the boring out of context gay conversation captain America has with an unknown and why he gives his shield to falcon just because he is black, leaving Baky his almost brother behind. The girl power scene was crab and too imposed. Spider man comes back after 5 years to find his friends still at high school ?!!! You ruined it all Marvel ,you destroyed my 11 years of entertainment with a really horrible ending that just serves you and not the dedicated fans whom made this possible for you. That is a promise from me and I believe from many other fans WE WON'T BE SUCKED UP IN YOUR WORLD OR UNIVERSE OR WHATEVER AGAIN. THAT IS IT. FIND NEW FANS."
1189,"This movie has Infinity stones and infinite loopholes. It's stupidity of director and actors to bring this garbage script to fruition but it's idioticity of all us to watch it. It's almost sad that what rises to top is not the best but mediocrity, and in this case, nonsense."
1190,"Are you guys serious? Why ruin Thor's character? Why use cheap jokes during war scenes? Why use cheap clichés? Sorry but these ruined my experience, but the story was good BTW."
1191,It was a very cool movie with a lot of emotion and action
1192,"It was hard going, same old Marvel machine churning out predictable plot. Would rather of re-watched Game of Thrones S8E3 again that of wasted my
time and money on this."
1193,"Not sure if it's a good idea to write a review here, as it seems, that Fanboys are rating down carefully considered reviews, just because they are not praising endgame, but so be it.I was not really disappointed, but I was also not stunned by this movie. It had a lot of shortcomings, logic-flaws and humor that simply wasn't funny or jokes that were somehow not fitting into the storyline. Some characters developed in a direction, I personally did not like and the overall ending to the movie seemed rushed and somehow chaotic.Overall it was a decent ending to this MCU phase, but as always, it's down to personal preference if you like a movie or not or if you wished for a different storyline.There are too many things, that were illogical:
Nebula not telling the guys what it takes to get the soul stoneTony Stark not even questioning why Pepper is in the end-fight and not taking care of their childrenDepressed, fat ThorCaptain America being able to use Thor's hammerCaptain America living a life with his girlfriend without someone remembering it in their timelineAll of a sudden, all dead heros appear out of nowhere - all coming from Wakanda - how the heck did they know and gather in the first place?If you haven't seen Captain Marvels end credit-scene, Captain Marvel would appear right out of nowhere in this movie and everyone would wonder why.Thor being depressed and fat and this Softie-Version of Hulk were the main character developments I also did not like.Personally didn't like Tony Stark being killed, but one saw that coming. After all, his story was told. Captain America living another live at least got him a happy end, although and illogical one. The hairstyle of captain Marvel ... ok, let's not talk about this one.There are certain scenes that are indeed epic, overall, the movie was entertaining, but I honestly liked Infinity War more.Cannot tie this to specfic reasons, it's a combination of all the aforementioned elements, that simply didn't do the trick for me to make it an epic movie.Considering myself being a big fan of the MCU franchise, I think all fans should see it, but if you are at least somehow interested in a decent and logic storyline, be warned you might not be too overwhelmed by this movie."
1194,Thanos please Snap this Movie is bad Script writing!
1195,"This movie is so full of cliches, it is so unoriginal and filled with stale humour that you just shouldn't do something as bad as watching this to yourself."
1196,"Also watched GoT season 8 episode 3 (the long night*) after Endgame;
let's just say I completely forgot about this final avengers movie. Literally that episode of GOT blows this movie away.MANY of the scenes weren't important/forgettable. Infinity War was just better, whatever the Russo brothers were ready to retire, therefore comic movies are going back to being crap.ITS OVER, MCU as we know it will be feminized by Disney and going down the crapper. It was fun while it lasted, btw Captain Marvel is HORRIBLE, the movie, character, everything. Great new dyke haircut."
1197,I liked the movie a lot. Surely it is a sequel to (Avengers: Infinity War) where it is a single long film. The battle where Thanos was killed was fantastic. I am very sad on Tony Stark but I am proud that his end was worth.
1198,I loved this movie. The action was great!!! I do not see them ever topping this one. The only thing that would have made it better is if I were in the movie
1199,"Avengers Endgame is the best superhero movie ever.
Tony Stark die is epic and dramatic scene.
The final battle is wonderful!"
1200,The best superheroes movie a end of era for marvel was very good
1201,"Don't waste your time, it's incredibly bad, 3 hours you will never get back."
1202,"Well overrated. I expected better, the previous one was better."
1203,"This movie drug on far too long. Captain Marvel ruined every scene she was in. Stars given for Thors performance which was hilarious. Looking forward to Ragnorak 2, maybe."
1204,"This movie is a desaster. I had high hopes that they can recreate the awesomeness of Infinity War but they couldn't deliver. Time travel ruines the logic of every movie. That of a movie universe of 10 years even more so.
But why didn't they let Captain Marvel do all the work. She can everything and is powerful and can speak and breathe in space and destroys spaceships with ease and is all around invincible and badass and female. What a joke...The last battle was confusing all around but it has its moments.I am in shock to be honest. What a pile of rubbish."
1205,"It was an disappointment! That's all i can say !
Absolute trash"
1206,This film is 181min long and only 5min are good. The rest is just boring...
1207,"No single fight scene at the start! Talk too much entire film! More like romance than an action blockbuster! Disappointed for action movie fans! Wait 2 hours more to watch the Avengers assemble and fight with Thanos! Most intense fight scene is Thor team up with Captain America to fight with Thanos! Many people asking why Captain America can use Thor hammer and ax! Actually who care! Silly time travel heist concept! And Marvel Studio's movie nowadays won't stick to previous film storyline anymore, they like to write whatever script they like! Good movie should not bored audience! This movie certainly not that kind of movie! I actually crying when Hawkeye race with Black Widow to jump off the cliff suicide! So silly but touching! Action scene really cannot outclass Age Of Ultron! Lastly really hope Anthony Mackie won't takeover Captain America character! Lol!"
1208,The intro sets the theme of the whole movie and what a boring slugfest this is.
1209,"Superheroes are supposed to be just that Superheroes. Not humans that are all wrapped up in emotional imbalanced feelings. Plus Thanos the villain is an aazzz kicking machine that literally couldn't be stop. This movie was slower developing than my grandmother's pet turtle. Fortunately, for me I went at midnight to see it so I got a chance to get a 2 hour power nap in so I could enjoy the l last hour."
1210,"Maybe my expectations were too high. Maybe I expected more elegant & complex solutions. But what this movie gave to me was huge disappointment - with a little fun here & there (mostly includes Thor). In the end, Infinity War remained as far more better movie."
1211,This what I was been waiting for months for and it really good it was the best marvel movie out there and if you dont see this your real missing out over the fun
1212,This a garbage movie with no sense at all...nothing justified...too way boring...very little action at the last 45 minutes and still nothing impressive...i will not waste my time again and continue my review...just do not listen to the postive reviews which i suspect they are not real reviewers...my advice is to save your money and your time as well.
1213,Seriously not getting what people like in this movie giving 10/10. This movie is horrible and very boring. Not expecting this from Marvel. It seems Marvel tried to make a cocktail of all hit formula in one movie to satisfy all type of audience. The end result - disaster. Worst movie of marvel ever made.
1214,"I can't for the life of me see why every major epic has to end with beloved characters being killed off. This is not right. This killing off of Black Widow and Iron Man ruined the entire film for me and has me questioning if following the Marvel universe is even worth it anymore. A great film can still be made without the murder of heroes, as was proved recently with Captain Marvel ( a wonderful film), but this new dark ""hard to watch"" direction in movies gets really depressing."
1215,"The film has too many references to previous Marvel films, and is not friendly to those who are not Marvel fans. General audiences may easily get confused: what is this and why is that? The story is not original either. We have seen too many time-travel films, such as Back to the Future and Days of Future Past. This film does not offer anything new. Besides, the last thirty minutes are kind of redundant, and the overall running time is unnecessarily long."
1216,"Was made for 6 to 15 years olds, made heroes so miserable for audience. animated and childish new characters such as the fox and trees... big disappointment."
1217,"Well, I've just seen this movie and although I am far from a fanboy of this genre I've seen enough of MCU films to comment that this one is far from the best. I really don't know where the 10 ratings are coming from, perhaps because people have seen the 21 previous films and have invested time in those and HAVE to like this one. I'm just glad it's all it's all over. There's better films out this year to look forward to. If you're a massive fan you'll give it 10, if you're not it's a meh."
1218,"First half plain boring, dialogues rubbish. Then it gets worse. A caricature of Thor, blurred action scenes, nonsensical time travel plot, weird Hulk, battle field done much better in Lord of the Rings and all of a sudden the whole Marvel universe appearing, where were there just 5 minutes before? And Thanos??? A sad follow up to an incredible infinity war."
1219,"This movie was awful; the acting was abhorrent, the special effects looked like a spy kids movie, and the plot was verging on completely ludicrous. I was ready for a simple popcorn flick, but this movie committed the worst crime of all; it was horrendously boring.This film had zero depth, the characters were two dimensional, and the jokes mostly fell flat for me. The actors looked bored, and at times there was more green screen than the Star Wars prequels. Worse still, there were times where it felt like certain actors weren't even on set at the same time as the others, and it was all edited together afterwards.I wish I had the infinity glove so I could click my fingers and cut this movie by 50% of its runtime."
1220,"This movie wrapped years of marvel movies I have seen and it was epic, people are saying it was slow it was boring, I don't think they understand how the movie was the story had emotion with that emotion you lived the last ever marvel avengers movie.This movie is just amazing it has thrown everything in the mix and I would say if you have not seen this movie your are missing out."
1221,"Without doubt one of the best films I've ever seen. I was completely gripped from the beginning. Fantastic performances by all of the cast (not that we'd expect any less), I find it hard to pick a favourite character because they're all so awesome, in this film more so than ever. I was on the edge of my seat throughout all of the action sequences, and have known few films to evoke such intense feelings of hope, and also great sadness/ loss. The humour throughout the film is spot on, and in one of the most important final scenes you could have heard a pin drop in the cinema, it was like everybody was holding their breath - staring at the screen in complete disbelief. As far as I can tell, no one saw that coming which is a credit to the writers and directors who were able to piece everything together so cleverly. It's an absolute masterpiece. Just one warning, though - if you're anything like me you'll need to go armed with tissues."
1222,"This movie should not exist. Please remake it.
Infinity war was much better.
I was kind of suspicious when they started promoting it so much.We need better ending to all these years of loyalty.
So many things in this movie are unreasonable.
Why why why"
1223,"Confusing use of time travel, tried to be too much of a comedy, poor acting throughout. Half-decent end fight scene which is why it managed to get some stars from me."
1224,great performancesincredible visualsstory ends in a way to set worth a new generation of marvel stories/charactersperfect send off for the original actorsa must see for any marvel or superhero fan
1225,"This movie is awesome! If you're a marvel fan you will enjoy this but then again you have probably already seen it.
It's funny, emotional and clever.
Yeah it is very long and most definitely could have been shortened but I just enjoy the characters so much I don't even mind."
1226,"I will not tell you anything about the plot, simply because almost everything in it can be considered as a spoiler, but I can convey my attitude. It was neither good nor bad.The plot is linear, simple and predictable. Classic Marvel.There was a lot of humor in the movie. Too much, especially considering the atmosphere of loss and hopelessness, which was at the end of the ""Infinity War"" and which one is trying to get to believe here.And I liked the final action scene.So in fact, I have nothing more to say about this movie. An entire era has passed. This is just the end.This is endgame."
1227,"First of all, I don't like superhero movies, they bored me as hell, because most of them follow the same formula. So that's why my opinion is different than the most, so it is not very accurate :D But I liked the previous Avengers movie - Infinity War. Endgame was predictable and boring most of the time. There are a few things that I really liked - Romanov and Hawkeye last scene; Iron Man last scenes; Some of Thor's jokes. But it was predictable that the Avengers will defeat Thanos; most of the jokes weren't funny to me; The Infinity stones gathering was boring and didn't like that Captain America was able to pull off Thor's hammer. I am sorry :D May be I am not right objectively but for me at least, I am sure I will not watch this movie again."
1228,"The fact that this movie still has a 9.2 rating really says a lot about the fans. They must either be 10, or have extremely low movie standards.Also, the unnecessary and overwhelming immature jokes gave me cancer."
1229,"MCU first killed Jarvis, then killed Tony. I hate MCU. MCU and Disney are spoiling Marvel characters."
1230,"I give it 3 stars for the huge effort, special effects and good acting. Overall it is a stupid film, bloated with self-importance and sentimentality, with poor pacing. Action scenes did not quite land with me, you know, superheroes throwing and punching stuff, who cares."
1231,"First how Hulk not healing and wearing a hand strap after using the stones...!? I hated the new character of hulk that he is not smashing and full of anger, so ridiculous. Second how Capten America lift Thor's hammer and started to use it as it's his hammer with thunderbolts? So weird. How Capten America gave away his armor to Falcon? I can't imagine Falcon flying and holding the Armor. This is disaster."
1232,"Several of the narrative problems that are present in Infinity War are not resolved or made worse by this remarkably lazy film. Of note, Thanos' ideology is both utterly incoherent and utterly alien to the Zeitgeist. The writers simply lacked the courage to make Thanos into the eugenicist that he so clearly should be. Without that edge to him he is a scene chewing comic book *villain* in the worse way. I simply did not care about the plot because the villain is a snidely whiplash joke. The film doubles down on the idiocy present in Infinity War as Thanos' end goal is just more so. This problem renders the film hollow, emotionally inert.That might have been overlooked if the film's overall structure wasn't, more or less, identical to Infinity War. Starting at about 30 minutes in the two films run remarkably in parallel with each other. The pieces are slightly jumbled and certain characters end up playing different beats but act to act, sequence to sequence, scene to scene the underlying scaffolding of the plot is the same. This would be better if the plotting wasn't redundant in the first place. Infinity War boiled down to 6 color coded chase scenes over MacGruffins. The same is true in Endgame but even more so. The plot device introduced to allow the team a fighting chance produces whole manners of plot contrivances, incoherence and murky what the heck is happening. There are 21 other films in the series and while I have seen every single one (some more than 3 times!) I simply don't have the convoluted metaphysics memorized. If you saw each film once in the theatre as they were released parts of this mess will confuse you.On that note the Infinity Stones are even more MacGruffins in this film as Endgame doesn't even bother to try to visualize their various powers. Infinity War turned magick users into mere boxers and this film continues to lower the bar for imaginative use of space magick. I still don't understand what the difference between, say, the space stone and reality stone is practically. There is nothing in the film that demonstrates their powers. This adds to the rote laziness that the film embodies.Inevitably in a film like this a few characters will get short changed. This happened here to my favorite character. For a film that so copied its predecessor's structure I am gobsmacked that not all re-matches occurred in the action scenes. Some of them do, but a pretty obvious and possibly entertaining one doesn't. On top of that the final moment-key to a character and the plot- is overly telegraphed due to the extraordinary amount of time spent with said character and the seeming checklist they have for a farewell tour. The balance is wrong for the character relationships. You can more or less guess the consequences based on screen time.None of the consequences of the two films seem final, abet textually a few of them are (I guess). Capital being what it is Disney would never kill off a bunch of Golden Geese; it was always faintly absurd the two films pretended otherwise. This narrative holdover from Infinity War takes a lot of heat out of the film.There are a few nice quips. There are also some promising team up moments in the film that point to brighter days. But in the end this is navel gazing nonsense."
1233,"Such a let down & huge disappointment! Infinity War was beyond amazing & perfectly setup for the best ending anyone could ever imagine, until you see this movie. I can't believe the Russo Brothers willingly destroyed our favorite characters we have been built up to love & cherish all these years. The plot holes are continuous & the only thing you learn to count on in this flick. The 1st half is boring & dragged out only to later have nano seconds with the anxiously awaited returned. Such a waste & felt like being robbed of those moments you couldn't wait to see! Beloved Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hulk are all ruined!! The charisma & pizazz is sucked out from all of them. Felt like it was written to only care about Captain America & Hawkeye. There are very few cool moments because it leaves you confused & wanting answers to the new plot holes. Unnecessary deaths & destruction end this era of fine films in to depression & just a ton more questions you feel you deserve answers to after being so loyal & attached. This was supposed to wrap things up & feel like an ending. Nope!"
1234,"This movie is pure awesomeness. This is a movie, i will be remembered for eternity.
Just a big thanks. Cinema was never so much entertaining.
Can't wait for blu ray disk"
1235,"I watched this the day after ploughing through the first season of 'The Boys'. What an anti-climax... If you want a super hero story that's intelligent, incredibly well-written, and with really interesting characters, go watch that instead... And in the MCU context, the first Avengers film is a much better example of good writing and directing, where the characters actually had some wit and.. yeah, well... character....The best thing I can say about Avengers: Endgame is that it very early on killed off Thanos and the Infinity Stones. That was unexpected and opened up the possibilities for the rest of the film. Except that it went straight on to a classic time-travel solution and makes a big deal out of this not being at all like described in any other film (except that it's exactly the same) along with an abundance of other cliches and plot holes (well described in the many other critical reviews here). The characters and their lines were generally bland and completely without the wit and bite as seen in the earlier Joss Whedon versions. And the ending was just as painfully slow as LotR: The Return of the King (yet another over-hyped blockbuster) with long-drawn-out overly sentimental scenes that added nothing to the story.6/10 = OK (just)"
1236,"He deserves an OSCAR.
What he did for marvel and the fans was great.
I'm great full to TONY STARK.
LOVE YOU 3000.💔"
1237,"Avengers Endgame is best MCU Movie. Endgame contains epic scenes. Especially Avengers Assemble, I am Iron Man and Captain America lifts Mjolnir scenes is Amazing"
1238,"A perfect film in everything, never boring and a wonderful ending"
1239,"It is the best movie I ever seen.this types of movies came once in a decked.the actor and actresses are give there best.
I ONLY just wanted to say see this movie"
1240,Just name is enough! Endgame is biggest blockbuster of the year.
1241,This is the movie everyone will love to see.. But you should be a true mcu fan to feel the film
1242,A breathtaking experience. Marvel played it's top trump card and blew alway any competition from start to finish. The battle scene is simply one of the if not greatest pieces of cinema ever. But it kept on giving after this. Anyone who gives this film less than a 10 is selling it extremely short.
1243,"I assume this was the most cheapest movie in the entire MCU. Cheap in the the sense they only had to pay for the huge star cast. I mean there is ultra Les action, the reasoning and solution provided was lame, time travel stuff with mumbo jumbo about the time lines, quantum realm and other to ensure that you suspend your belief and feel good about it.
The final battle is smaller in scale and was dark and easy to shoot or tender. Not expected...
Adding some Bollywood elemnts like the drama and emotions to make it more likeable.
Was sad with the movie overall. I mean with the scale of fights and action in infinity war, this version looks pale and soft. Thanos was so easily defeated and gone in no time.
The building up of hopes, fan debates, so called theories, and all other crap all around the world for the movie was seriously moronic looking at the movie.
If you write down the point of the movie or read it somewhere which explains the events, you will find it absurd.
All the noise boils down to time travel and fix it all and bring back the dead and all happy.
Not at all worthy. Felt cheated ."
1244,"'Avengers: Infinity War' undeniably impressed me, given it's cliffhanger ending. I was anxious to see 'Endgame' and see how things wrapped up. As you know, the plot consists of the heroes trying to patch things up after Thanos' destruction. I will try not to give too much away in this review, because spoilers can be, well, spoiling!While the film is quite exciting and surprising things do happen, all I could think about was getting to the end, when everything fell into place. The final outcome was not what I would've done with the story, but it's nothing to complain about. Also appearing is a peanut butter sandwich (you'll see).It's quite exciting and full of both drama and humor, along with cameos from characters we haven't seen in a long time. It's acted fine, nonetheless I still think the performances in 'Infinity War' were far superior, for some reason.However, I found that I didn't enjoy this installment as much as 'Infinity War'; I suppose not being a full-on Marvel fan made me surprised but not too sad when characters died then. I was simply impressed with how plot developments were actually made! Marvel usually suffers from 'nothing ever happens' disorder, where they get too afraid to make something big occur for fear it will upset the fans. In that department, 'Endgame' is also an improvement.It may be the end of the explosive, cast-of-thousands Marvel movies, but it's of course not the end of stand-alones and spin-offs. 'Avengers: Endgame' is a fine little movie, but I know regardless of what I've said in this review you'll see it anyway. So I say, ""Have fun."""
1245,Absolutely strange how they could cut so strong first part of Avengers and spoil the second one! All dialogues are weak and absurd same as a few plot lines. The last 5 minutes of the film is all-around failure!
1246,A big disappointment for Thor fans. Intentionally made him dummy and useless. No other Avenger has such a great screen presence than Thor and this was intentionally ruined in the movie. Was expecting till the end for Thor to come back in this movie. It was totally stupid to make Thor like this.
1247,"So I recently read a book on what not to do when you write a story and this film did all of those things.First the movie takes over 40 minutes to actually start. Before Scott lang joins the gang, nothing happens except some Dialoge exchange but nothing really important that could have been done otherwiseSecond the characters don't have an arc wich is really important, characters like banner and stark don't have one, they don't learn something essentialy new to their character traits.
Thor has a somewhat arc but it seems very setup like in a children's cartoon.Also they bloss over many things that where set up in the previous movies, like ""only the infinity gauntlet can hold the infinity stones"" or ""only very strong carries can even hold one stone let alone the entire gauntlet""And the time travel aspect was pretty weird, first they go with the ""two time stream"" and then sometimes the ""only one time stream"" then ""two time streams"" again and so on.
Also they don't really explain what the problem with timetravel is.
Banner just mumbles something that nobody understood and baam that was it.BTW I find it pretty funny that stark wants a spectral reading of a quantom experiment......the problem is that light is made out of quantom particles, it is like feeling for atoms with your finger.Also Thanos wasn't a real thread any more, he was just a bad guy the fight, the ""terror"" that came with him in infinity war is complitly gone they just fight him.Also gamora past traveled into the future was pretty overplayed they could have done so much more with that but they only used her to get the ship from Thanos to earth and blow up the Avengers head quarters.....she could have easily get the stones and try to travel back but the avengers stop her and then Thanos sends the ship for help.This film has so many more issues but I don't want to write over 10.000 words on this.
This film is a disaster because it felt like a kids cartoon and not a propped ending to the Thanos Era.
So many mistakes could have been prevented but I think that the producers are to blame.You can see in some places that there are story writings aspect and character arcs involved but the producers probably didn't want that.
Those arcs involve taking a risk and that could ruin their franchise.
So they stuck with cheap jokes and no character arcs what so ever.
And the arcs they put in felt very very very arbitrary and didn't really stick with the audience."
1248,Well for watching this movie and the movie before it's not make sense last movie fight him to not get the stone and this movie fighting to get the stone again it's funny last movie he get the stone because he threat them to kill one of they friends this movie they all want to die for it 😂 writer so stupid just want to make movie to get money and what they do is advertisements !!
1249,"I found the story and the rhythm of the movie so messy, slow and boring. Really expected more."
1250,"The movie was really bad for many reasons.
Buy what really make is worse is that :
1. They killed Iron man
2. Thor was fat and ugly and has no role
3. Captain America got old
4. Captain America got the hammar from Thor
5. All other stupid things to change our Marvel world by killing iron man and changing the others role"
1251,"Having come out of Infinity Wars blown away, to then be greeted with this as the follow up was a complete and utter let down! The plot holes that are opened up when time travel is introduced just ruins the full experience. The fact that at the end they could just pull the stones from the glove is ridiculous, did they not think about doing that when Mantis has Thanos under her control in Infinity wars?? This story could have been taken a whole different direction, with a lot more action to obtain the stones back from Thanos! Thor was made to be weak, Captain Marvel was barely there and the HULK was just all wrong! The comedy was about the only saving grace for me."
1252,"End game
The film ""End game"" will have you at the edge of your seat!! It was directed by Anthony Russo and Joe Russo presented in April of 2019. End game was like a never seen before film. You will have so many different emotions watching this film. Every seen is daring and you could never guess what would happen next. Some of the most powerful super heros made sacrifices just to save our world(earth). Everything in this film was believable, Characters played their roles so well. Especially Karen Gillan (Nebula), She did a great job playing off her role and making it believable. I would recommend this film to anyone who loves action! The film doesn't have much fighting but i guarantee you will not get bored watching."
1253,"What were they thinking? Honestly, everything that made the other marvel movies enjoyable was turned on its head. What did you like about Thor in prior movies? Yeah, scratch that. What did you like about Hulk in past movies? Scratch that too. What were you expecting after seeing Fury page Cap Marvel in Infinity War and watching the Cap Marvel movie? Sorry, but completely underutilized. Not sure why they bothered pushing her into the story at the very end.I'm not sure I could come up with a worse way to end it all. I really want my money and my 3 hours back.Oh, and don't bother waiting for a post credit scene... You'll at least want your half hour of credits time back.Ugh... Could have done SO much better"
1254,"I've expected much more as it was the final chapter but to be honest infinity war was much more interesting and mind banding, the story happened in the end game I expected them almost all of them before watching the movie so I was waiting to be proved wrong and get excited unfortunately I wasn't, End game was more emotional rather than interesting, they paid too much attention to viewers satisfaction they did what emotional viewers would have wanted.End of the story"
1255,Not bad movie but not even like dark night to over come it
1256,I was thinking it's gonna the perfect cbm movie of all time it's a big disappointment it's really bad a big mess of events and characters jumping in middle of the another one it's worst then josstice league
1257,"Worst than Batman VS Superman
infinity war is better than this movie, please bring back my money !!!!!"
1258,I was really disappointed and expected so much out of this film and nothing good came out of it. Within the first 30 minutes there was a disappointment. First of all they found Thanos right away and all the sudden they discovered he destroyed the infinity Stones which was crap and worst yet it became a time traveling movie which made zero sense and you would have thought the universe would have collapsed with all the screw ups they made in the timespace continum. Not only did Thanos and his army travel through to the future before Thanos had the infinity Stones but when they were all destroyed that made infinity war irrelevant because there would have been no point and getting the stones since Thanos is now dead. Also when Ironman died Dr strange could have easily brought him back to life since that's all he did in his own movie was bring dead people back to life. Also when Captain America went to return the infinity Stones makes you wonder how that went when he gave the soul stone back to the Red skull? Also with Captain America staying in the past and getting old is there now another Captain America still frozen? The movie was built up to be a huge let down. I'm done spending my money on marvel movies.
1259,"I wasted 3 hours from my live. Captain Marvel was much more interesting. It is like this movie is done just to be released, i don't believe that initial idea for this movie is what we watch now."
1260,"Never ever use timetravel to resolve or fix anything, when you start to see or use timetravel to fix the past then you enter uncharted land where anything is possible if it make sense or not.So you killed my father I will timetravel to kill your father that you dont get born but hey cant you timetravel to kill my father so I dont get born but why you then want to kill my father?Can we sure that every change in the past will not split a new present so no matter what I fix in the past it wont change my present thus creating another present where I habe no access too.This can go on and on and on so even this movie could play 24h each solution for anyhing can be changed and unfixed with next time travel step.For this movie I can say only no matter how it ends who knows if in next movie some timetravel will unwind and we are square one or in just random mess.Because of timetravel you must disconnect to anything because no matter what happens it can be rewinded and changed with a complete different outcome.I am glad I didnt have to pay money for thiss mess."
1261,"The movie itself establishes time travel as follows: You cannot alter your past to change your future as your past becomes your future. Also, when you alter the past you're creating a rift in the timline creating an completely alternate reality. This is explained by Hulk and The Ancient one, the latter also explains that the new reality wouldnt survive if a Infinity Stone was taken from it.Despite this Cap is able to leave the primary reality that we follow all along, not warp his way but instead stay back in the past, change it, and grow old and ultimately show up on a bench. The scene depics that he is the same Cap but regarding the rules established this is not possible. That is not the same Cap. As soon as he warped to the past and decided to stay with Peggy he changed it and created another reality in which he grows old.And if a reality cannot survive without ONE stone how is the primary reality able to when Cap takes them all away to their original timeline?Sloppy."
1262,"****SPOILER WARNINGS FOR AVENGERS: ENDGAME****Disney's apparent quest to make male characters less traditionally masculine and female characters more so, results in a convoluted tale whose biggest sacrifice is a coherent story.Start with the disasters that are Thor and Hulk, the two characters above all known for their great strength. Both of them are castrated of their power in this film.Thor's last two films have been a comedic spoof of his character. Late night television couldn't even spoof him anymore, for they have done it themselves. The god of thunder is now a useless, emotional wreck drunkard, not just for one gag, but for the entirety of the film. Hulk, made famous for his struggle with violence and bouts of destruction likewise is reduced to comedic fodder, including a joke about his inability to Hulk-out with rage anymore.To a lesser degree Captain America is another emotional wreck and runs a counseling group. In it, we are sure to have Disney praise gay dating to check all the PC checkmarks. At the end, he passes his shield to Falcon and the five-pointed star is clearly inverted in the shot, which doesn't help Disney's reputation for adding devilish or cultish symbolism in films.The main women in the story, with the exception of Nebula, are depthless, Mary Sues - the new business model of Disney and other uncreative Hollywoodians. Danvers, Natasha, the witch, Okoye, Gamora, Wasp, Valkyrie, all overflow with competence. There is little to say about them other than they are all clones of the same character, filled with all the strength and competence lost by Thor and Hulk.The film drags on for seeming hours while we are shown what an apocalyptic wreck the world has been for five years since The Snap. Why is it apocalyptic? Who knows. There are still 3.5 billion people on earth. Has everyone just been in counseling while baseball stadiums collapse and are overrun with foliage?The movie, devoid of originality in every scene, is filled with cliches about how ""it's gotta work"" and other painful dialogue. The climactic moment, where Stark *literally pickpockets* the stones from Thanos in about two seconds, is a cliche overdone ad nauseum. The protagonist scuffles with villain and is defeated in the fight-but surprise! The protagonist produces the thing he snuck from the villain. And the villain has his mouth hanging open. And so do the viewers who can't believe they paid to see *another* movie with that climax.In short, Disney has about killed the Marvel franchise."
1263,It couldnt be better than this. I enjoyed every second of this cinematography icon.
1264,"Marvel made time travel a joke.
It is kids time travel with no paradox.
I was hoping a good story line. Worst marvel movie ever with no seriousness of each and every hero."
1265,"Hey Tony, we need time travel to make the plot go forward, will you help?
'NO'
'hmm, well ok but the plot doesn't advance untill we have time travel...'We watch 1 minute of Tony Stark scratching his balls...
'Oh, hey guys... I figured out that time travel thing'Oh SUPER!! thank's Tony U R AwEsOmE <3''Aww shucks guys, well try not to make too many paradoxes and plot holes will ya?'WE GOT THIS FAM'The End"
1266,"Please don't explain rules to a concept and then break them in the same movie. We are watching, we aren't stupid."
1267,"I had originally written a much longer, more detailed review in an attempt to pick apart this Greek tragedy as Marvel Studios officially exits caring-- stage left.In the end, I ultimately decided to simply present a side-by-side view of Infinity War (IW) and Endgame (EG) over 2 major criteria:Criteria 1 : The almost comedic devolution of the characters.Thanos:
(IW) Three Dimensional and overall incredibly well-rounded villain. Portrayed as being afflicted with overwhelming grief which he overcomes only through his deep-seated foundational belief in 'restoring balance' to the universe, irrespective of the cost.
(EG) Amish. Reduced to the 'evil because evil' trope.Thor:
(IW) Learns through the virtue of self-sacrifice, the innate and immutable responsibility one of royalty inherits through their birth-right, to be a just and able successor to their father, for the betterment of their people.
(EG) Broken-spirited has-been, reverts back to being a man-child.Hulk:
(IW) Useless.
(EG) Somehow more useless.Hawkeye:
(IW) Who.
(EG) Cares.Criteria 2 : The plot being created by a deep learning robot skimming bad fan-fics.On its own, honestly, isn't the worst film I've ever seen. Certainly very enjoyable, well-choreographed, sprinkled in there's some nice cinematography, littered with (for the most part) seamless CG, only a few editing mishaps, and with a some excellent quips here and there. Apart from that, however, it falls short on almost every metric.What made EG especially disappointing was that IW felt like such a well-executed and promising first-act film for this follow-up to be just such an overwhelming let-down in comparison.Overlooking the fact that this film has plot-holes large enough to navigate a burning blimp through. In the end it can all honestly be boiled down to simply being a little too overly concerned with being political, and in turn ended up being a very blatant cash-grab by Disney, along with some pretty flagrant beat-you-over-the-head, out of left field, virtue signaling.Captain Marvel inexplicably gets a haircut off-screen. Thor delegates his throne to Valkyrie on a whim. Cap' passes off the shield to Falcon. It all just seems like a PC Twitter user's fever dream. Everything is just so arbitrarily connected that even-- uncharacteristic to Marvel movies-- some of the comedy seem misplaced. This film struggles so much with deciding on a pace, underlining theme, and prevalent tone that in the end the final product just ended up feeling lazy and non-cohesive.In essence:
Pros -
Cons - Exists-- both canonically, and in real life."
1268,"I was so excited to see this movie. 1.5 hours later I walked out from sheer boredom. First movie I have ever walked out of. If it was a normal length feature, I would have suffered through the whole thing, but knowing I have another 1.5 hours to go made me want to cry in misery. I left my husband and ran errands ... THAT is how boring it was.Boredom aside, there were so many eye rolling moments that left me surprised with the praise this movie received. AND if you have ever studied physics and the theories of time travel ... I'd suggest you do yourself a favor and leave this for the flat earthers."
1269,"This one star review is necessary to bring you sheep back to reality. This movie was a boring mess and a major letdown. Infinity War was far better, and that isn't saying much. All of these Marvel films except for a handful out of the 22, 23, however too many have been made-have the same feel by the time credits roll. The MCU's true legacy is showing how if a studio can keep audiences laughing, they'll shut their brains off and ignore the inanity (inanity not insanity, clarification for the lemmings) in front of them."
1270,"SO many reasons to love this movies but so many more to just completely hate it. I mean, how many times can you just do whatever you like in a movie and have to explain it in the movie that it is okay because of this reason. What a joke. Also, the movie felt like a mixture of ten percent of ten different movies mixed into one and was just not fun to try to follow. In fact, after the most boring first hour in moviedom history, the movie just started to do stuff that felt like it was filmed before the story was even written or a script in hand. And please dont get me started on the Hulk, I wont spoil anything but will say that it was not a pleasure watching him become the weakest Avenger. This movie should have been cut down to about two hours - it would have still blown chunks but at least it wouldnt have been a sleepy third hour. The movie makes me wish that movies offered satisfaction guarantees and returns. I wouldnt have returned any of the snacks but I would have asked for my ticket money back. It stank. And finally, the biggest let down was the acting - these people get paid loads of money and their acting is stilted and boring. Well, enough - I must be wrong as it is making so much money. Sorry, don't see it."
1271,"Too much hype
Toooooo many loopholes
The story is so impossible that it makes fiction look like fiction .. I mean it always was but this gives me physical indigestion

1272,"First, i gave it credits, it's the most hyped and overrated movie of 2019...Imagine eating a very long steak unsalted and with no condiments.. yeah... that's what i felt for a very long 188 minutes...The movie is boring to the point making you watch the hours for at least 2,3 times, to make some sneaks to your facebook, news, sports, whatever... and why?Because it's extremely confusing, unfunny, action scenes are too fast paced and superficial, emotions are artificial and slow scenes are excruciating...Glad it's a end game...."
1273,Watched midnight show here in Dubai.. Seriously the movie sucks big time.. I didnt like a bit.
1274,"Unnecessarily they have streched this movie for 3 hours. There are so many parts in the movie that are confusing and unexplained. First how come nebula is alive if she kills herself from the past she is messing with the timeline. Iron man syas the same thing at the start of the movie but she does it anyhow and she is still alive. Second how Captain America is able to picks up Thor's hammer..Hulk is known for his anger and powerful man but they showed completly opposite..why didn't they use him in any of the fight scene. The biggest disappointing part was Captain Marvel they released that movie just before End Game showing that she is the most powerfull of all the avengers but the only thing she did is to bring the Iron Man back to earth and break Thanos plane..when she tries to fight Thanos she can't even remove glove from his hand..How Iron man was able to removed those stones from his glove..Then captain america goes into space time to place the infinity stones and he comes back as old man and young man stays back in 1970 with his wife how the heck did that happen why do you want to show all of that..Instead they could have shown as Captain America wearing that glove and kills Thanos
with a snap of his fingers..Then the captain america is dead and someone else take his place..at least Iron man would have been alive..overall very confusing, lots
Of Unexplained parts and very disappointig."
1275,"Could have been better!!!
marvel has a toxic fan base people freak out on lame jokes in the movie whenever something is going in with a good flow!
Terrible CGi overrated poor storyline could've been better!"
1276,"Where to begin. 30 mins in I got an uneasy feeling. An hour in something felt very wrong. Two hours in I was in shock. This film is a bloated, BORING, convoluted slog of time travel utter nonsense. The positive reviews of this film have me convinced that professional reviewers, pod-casters and tv/youtube talking heads are being paid for favorable reviews. I'd hate to sound like a conspiracy minded person but...
During the 3 hours in a sold-out theatre I barley heard a chuckle as most of the jokes fell flat, rare for a marvel movie. The end garnered no applause, also rare for an event movie like this. So many characters are minimized or just poorly written. For the record I loved Infinity War. I thought I was walking in to the greatest comic book super hero movie ever and I could not be more disappointed."
1277,"Such a disappointment. They over hyped it. Too many plot holes that gave us more questions in the end. Russo brothers dropped the ball big in this one. No elaboration on the ancient one, doctor strange, hulk doesn't fight anyone, Loki disappears, and you never hear anything about vision. This movie made me cringe. If you follow the comics and a true fan of the movies then you will be lost. If you don't follow it like that then you are going to be as lost as you have ever been in any movie. This seems like the fall of the MCU."
1278,"I didn't find this movie all that interesting. I felt it was about as good as Infinity Wars. This film feels like a complete ripoff of the last episode of Star Trek Voyager that was also called Endgame and also involved time travel. I don't mind when time travel is used in a movie or tv show as long as it makes some sense and somewhat consistent within the universe and doesn't leave giant gaping holes everywhere. This movie failed hard with the time travel stuff. I don't recall time travel being an aspect in the MCU, so whipping out the good old time travel trope randomly required way too much suspension of disbelief for me.The fact that Tony Stark created a time machine overnight just blew my mind that someone actually thought it was a good idea to put it in the movie. The Professor Hulk stuff mind numbingly ridiculous. I'm confused as to why it was decided that Banner would just be Professor Hulk for this movie. It didn't add anything to the movie and made his character boring. Alcoholic, overweight comedic relief Thor destroyed Thor's character. It's not really even explained why he turned into an alcoholic bum. He decapitates Thanos within the first 5 minutes of the movie and the next time we see him, he's an alcoholic raging over video games. Honestly, nothing is really explained in this 3 hour movie. The directors thought it was best to like 90 minutes that added zilch to the filmThe time travel in the film renders all the other films in the MCU as pointless. There are no consequences for anyone's actions. The Avengers failed in Infinity War, but good thing Tony Stark created a time machine to fix past failures. Paradoxes be damned and the ""rules"" of time travel can just be changed at anytime as this movie did.The thing at the end with Captain America putting back all the stones in their original time line didn't make sense as how he'd be able to even do that. The movie couldn't be bothered to show him doing that either. Him going back to 1940 to be with Peggy Carter doesn't make sense either and messes up his character. Did he just sit and watch all this bad stuff happen throughout the years? Why didn't it create an alternate universe?Just all around dull movie. It would've been better if the Avengers traveled to an alternate universe to get the stones instead of time travel. Then there wouldn't have been as many gaping holes in this film. It doesn't seem like Infinity Wars and Endgame were thought through."
1279,"I am quite amazed at the lack of original content in this movie.They manage to recycle about 50% of infinity war into this movie. Isn't that just lazy?They could have easily cut 1 hour of meaningless content and add 15min of explaination for the random things that happen with no context.They road mapped the movie in the first 15min so no real surprises.Acting was good. Special effects were good. I liked the David character, surprisingly 'natural'.Also Hoyts NZ - survey who likes your recliner seats - I think you might be surprised it's < 50%.I wish I had spent my money on a creative original movie, rather than a super hero tribute movie.I am not entertained."
1280,"I do not care this movie has high ratings. If fans of the franchise are happy to be fooled by Disney, it is their problem.This movie has many discrepancies in the script, starting from the "" time travel theories "" the characters talk about ( and that do not occur in the execution of these "" trips in the past "" and to the nonsense of the actions of the characters.The script has been inspired a lot by Dragon Ball, now the Endgame is about finding some gems...
The movie has to show all the Marvel superheroes and it is obviously problematic to have so many characters all at once in the very same motion picture, this brought the lenght to something like more than 3 hours and believe me, you will fall asleep, fortunately.This movie is ill conceived, it is a disrespectful act towards the fans and yes it is the highest grossing movie of all time becase fan boys had to watch the "" Final Chapter "" but the movie is nothing special even technically (photography, directing, special effects).
The Avengers movies were all terrible, but I must confess this is by far the worst one. I have watched them all because it was the only was to see an old friend (going to movies is the only way, unfortunately only movies he likes).
Stay far from it. It will be beneficial for your health.
Use these three hours to do something else, you willl never regret it!"
1281,"I'm a long time MCU fan. Been here since good old hulk days (let's not talk about that). But this movie is NOT what it was all cracked up to be.There are so many things that just go unexplained. Stuff just happens for no reason.
Eg Cap picking up Thor's hammer.Thor is utterly and COMPLETELY RUINED. Why the Russo brothers thought it would be a good idea to make most people's favourite character fat and pathetic I will never understand. And to be honest that is what ruined the film for me the most. There was absolutely no benefit from doing that. Why spend all that time getting Thor's new axe and all this power to then take it all away? He'll just become one big meme now.
Hulk still wasn't made useful. Even hulk in the first avengers was better than this ""professor hulk"".
The film was confusing as hell and made absolutely no sense timeline wise.
This is probably going to be a generally unpopular opinion but I think genuine MCU fans will agree with me when I say Infinity War was better. Yes Endgame was sad and it made me cry my eyes out but I was also crying because they ruined it. It's not hard to please MCU fans. It really isn't."
1282,"As a fan from day 1 I am truly disappointed. They wrecked Thor, funny at first but awful for the whole movie. Fight scenes were mild at best and the characters did not perform in the way we all love to see them. Iron man barely in his suit. The hulk never fights. They underuse all their powers."
1283,"Boring, non-sense, crowd pleaser. All the good things made in IW were destroyed here."
1284,It's just the hype of the actors for which the audience are getting excited.
1285,"Gave it an extra star because the ending was a fitting finale. If you haven't seen this at a movie theatre, then just wait for it to come to Netflix or whatever streaming service Disney will release. I was in the theatre for close to 4 hours and it's just not worth it."
1286,"Just when you think that they couldn't make a movie worse than Doctor Strange, they throw this at you. It's an action move that tries too hard, way too hard to be complex, and then fails at it spectacularly.Ignore the terrible attempts at humor, and the extremely useless first hour, even then it felt way too long. It's not like the cast is bad, there are good actors in there, but either they are never utilized or are given such flimsy characters that I don't know who I hated more; the actor for taking that role or the character for being that bland.Oh and the more-than-obvious-from-a-million-light-years-away attempt of shoving feminism and racial equality down your throat. It looks awful and felt like they were making fun and not supporting it. Like they wanted to cover all bases and earn the most points, from their grandest money-cow. Absolutely ridiculous!Also the video game ad? It's The Secret Life of Walter Mitty all over again.And the story? Well, there's no point to it. It's filler and mainly builds up to that ending that too was underwhelming and had nothing unique anyway."
1287,"Alright, the movie was great. At the start my reaction was ""wtf am I watching"". At the end I still didn't know what I was watching, but I gave it a 10.Most of the people rating below 10 here object to some specific thing. Here is my perspective to the most common objections:1) ""didn't like the new Thor""
Sure, it's not the Thor you know, you love, you expect, but it's real. He lost everything, he's devastated, he's not the same Thor. He looks messed up and he is. The best part of Marvel is how the characters grow and change. This is Marvel at its finest.Also, as a sidenote, his journey is parallel to his journey in recent comics, where he loses an arm instead of an eye and establishes new asgard on earth after asgard is devastated.2) ""didn't like the new Hulk""
Most people really wanted Hulk to let loose and be badass destroying machine. It would have been cool, but it would have taken another sideplot and scene to get professor hulk into rage hulk. Instead they let captain marvel be the destroyer. Well, since it isn't the last Hulk movie it wasn't mandatory for him to have a scene... On the other hand, cap and Iron man scenes were mandatory. So not a huge deal.Also, some people didn't like the merged hulk, smart in big body. Even Valkyrie says it in the movie!! It was new and different. This was also comics based. In peter david's 90s run he explored all sorts of different hulks including at least one which was big and smart.It's just part of the characters growth, banner was always depressed and angry. Now he's happy! I also liked his humor, which reminded me of RDJ humor, which I think is critical for Marvel going forward. So, overall it was cool and interesting.3) ""First part of the movie was too slow""
In my opinion Infinity war was too much action. I had no idea what they would do and I liked how they struggled with that same exact question WHAT DID WE DO? The scenes were funny and great character development in the meantime, so I liked it even though I had no clue where it was going.4) ""the time travel didn't make sense""
Okay everybody, it didn't make sense, because time travel doesn't make sense. It was a plot device to revisit moments from the past to remind us of a decade of awesome moments... And it was awesome!!!!5) ""The captain america ending doesn't make sense with how time travel works""
Ya hulk told you how time travel works and you believed him!!!! Haha j/k. Forget trying to figure out how it works. In the original script cap died in the battle. Cap and iron man both dying in the battle is a bit too generic. This ending for cap mirrors the comics where he ages. It's true to the character whose struggle was always balancing his personal life, robbed from him by his 80 years in ice. Iron man's death was true to his character who went from selfish jerk playboy to giving everything for the world and his daughter. So no the time travel didn't make sense, but deal with it.6) ""why did they get rid of cap/iron man/black widow""
There contracts were up, it's been a while. We all love RDJ iron man. But we don't need a 60 year old RDJ iron man, time to let go.7) ""why was Hawkeye even in this movie I hate him""
Well they set up his family previously so he was the poster boy for everyone he loved being lost. Yes, everyone hates Hawkeye because he's not that pretty in the face and he's not a billionaire playboy. He did well in his role and was a pivotal part of lending weight to the dusting of IW.8) ""why was there a women's march ""
Haha, well it was a bit silly, but for I'm sure for a lot of little girls and big ones it will make a difference in their life, Don't take away their moment.9) ""I hate everything!!""
No u don't!"
1288,"...and pull the hype train over.
Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ.
It's just not the whole sum of its parts.
Lots of great parts but not cohesively held.
Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief.
The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes.
You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours.
Did it need 3 hours? No.
Is it better than infinity war? No.
Will you enjoy it? Definitely."
1289,"I read the user reviews before I saw this movie. I thought perhaps the negative reviews were a bit unfair. But no! The cinema was filled to the max- I have never seen this before! Today's paper reported it is the highest grossing movie in history! Why? The audience were enraptured, laughing at seemingly unfunny moments, and cheering when good guy characters emerged. I think everyone drank the kool aid!
Most of the movie is ordinary and just like other Avenger movies. Special effects were used to insert characters in cameo roles. Nothing new here folks!
I have tried to analyze its popularity and have concluded that it is really simple to please the masses. People dont want complex scifi, a simple good- bad guy formula with a touch of routine comedy, good looking actors made more attractive with special effects touch ups, and some character familiarity will do the trick. Throw in a lot of multicultural references and political correctness and voila! Big bucks."
1290,"Do you remember your least favourite episodes from the Star Trek series?
You know the ones I'm talking about. They involve time travel.
Yup, when you have no idea how to fix the writing mess you've made, reach into your bag of hacks and pull out time travel.
So too have the writers of the latest Marvel film.
Worse yet, it's a mirror image of the previous Marvel Avengers film. Only this time, we have the heroes digging around in the past tracking down all the stones (as opposed to Thanos doing it) and a giant pointless CGI fight at the end (just like the last time around.)I couldn't figure out how the film was 3 hours long, until they started getting the stones, each section is played out seemingly just to pad the runtime. When the Hulk puts on the Iron-Man created infinity glove and snaps his fingers to bring everyone back, all the returned folks take it quite well, just a quip and a node of ""oh, we were dead, and now we're back? That's fine.""This film glosses over so many more interesting aspects of the plot in a rush to get to the CGI fest that is the end.Sure, the film will make billions from all the fans (and let's face it, this is for the fans only) but it doesn't deserve to. It's a hackneyed mess."
1291,"So....boring. Bad CGI, lazy writing and just an all out disaster. Huge fan of the MCU, but this is the worst one by far."
1292,"I went to this movie expecting a lot, given both the hype/build up it had received and the absolutely amazing predecessor in Infinity War last year.What I got however, was more questions than answers. The plot was weak at best and the storytelling was absolutely awful. The pace of storytelling was almost uncomfortable to watch at points. Infinity War very cleverly managed to give some real key characters decent screen time and dialogue, Endgame failed at this, massively. And the evolution of some characters in this film (Thor and Hulk) was laughable. Add o this, the film definitely did NOT need to be 3 hours long. It could quite easily have fitted into a 2-2.5 hour slot quite easily, they definitely hung out the wrong areas of the story for too long and for me personally, focusing on the wrong elements of the story.I really am disappointed that the culmination of 22 films led to such a disappointing end, especially with the promising lead up Infinity War offered."
1293,"First: I am not a diehard MCU fan. Some of the MCU movies I love, and others I don't. I like to take it movie by movie and not just buy into hype and automatically give a high rating because I'm emotionally attached to MCU or the characters.That said, I found End Game very disappointing. While Infinity War was outstanding, end game had very little real plot, was filled with moments that were made to make a theatre full of diehards cheer because their favorite characters were all together in a dramatic montage, and quite frankly was just a large cop out. After all that happened in Infinity War the answer was time travel?! I would have hoped they could have come up with something a little more creative than that. Maybe something that involved plot and strategy with a little adversity. Isn't that what writers and directors are paid to do?It also took almost an hour to really start the movie, and once it started, there was hardly any real plan. An hour of build up that concluded with: tony stark and ant man figure out time travel, the avengers take 5 minutes to figure out where the stones are, they go back in time and get them with hardly any adversity, and that's pretty much that.I find it incredibly frustrating that this movie is getting the feedback it's getting, because it just really wasn't a good movie. And going in I was SUPER excited and really wanted to like it. There was no problem solving, there was no adversity, and again, the answer to the most shocking and dramatic ending of a MCU movie was to simply time travel and have the same fight all over again but make it significantly worse. Also the big final battle was a mere 10 minutes out of a 3 hour movie! And captain marvel who wasn't even relevant in Infinity War is all of a sudden this cure all when the you-know-what looks like it's hitting the fan.Was it entertaining? Absolutely. But that's all it was: moderately entertaining but worth forgetting. Iron man dying was supposed to have a massive emotional impact that I just didn't feel, the so called ""humor"" was forced, and the last 20 minutes is just a bunch of nostalgic pictures of the avengers while contemplating Tony Stark's death.Maybe they just rushed it. I'm not sure. But after an extremely morally conflicting and well thought out Infinity War that ended the way it did, I have absolutely NO idea how people think this was a good movie. Very disappointed in what I thought would be an amazing conclusion to the Avengers."
1294,"I had stopped going to marvel movies for many years because I had just simply stopped caring and then Infinity War happened. I went and saw 6 times because it was just that fantastic of a film. The pacing, the character development, the action the drama and the comedy all came together perfectly.This film did none of that unfortunately. I found myself bored and actually kind of annoyed at the direction the characters took. Fat pathetic Thor? Ok maybe for a bit but he pretty much stays that way the whole film, it's embarrassing. The Beta Hulk thing was funny at first but when you realize he's not going to do any hulk smashing through the entire film, you'll go from ""haha"" to ""wtf"". I like Hawkeye but he had too much screen time which wouldn't have been bad had they done that for the other characters. The time travel thing? Leaves so many plot holes it's insane, I get it's a comic book movie but my suspension of disbelief was just stretched way too far. Also the PC pandering with all the women ending up on the battlefield together? Come. On. I'm sure that's the direction the MCU is going in the future so you can count me out. The original cast built it to be a billion dollar IP all for them to hand the torch off to lesser character and actors. Very very sad. Disappointed."
1295,Riddled with plot holes and a complete waste of 3 hours was like 2 and half hours of pointless talking and 30 mins of action could of easily been 2 hours or an hour long. One of the most ridiculous things is captain marvel brings down a spaceship but then gets hurt by a little explosion from a van and a punch from thanos
1296,The story was terrible. The dialogue was terrible. Character development was forced. The end battle was impossible to keep up with. This movie does NOT live up to the hype.
1297,"Avengers Infinity wars and Endgame might very well have been one movie and therefore could have saved me a ticket to the movie theater for the second time round. It wasn't necessary for it to be divided into two parts, hell it wasn't necessary for Endgame to be almost 3 hours long considering the flimsy plot!After I saw infinity wars, I already had a suspicion I was cheated, and Endgame proved that I was right. This entire movie was trying to drag for so long and even the quasi emotional scenes just didnt do it for me. I felt nothing when Black Widow jumped to her death, which was one of the few parts of this movie that actually made sense, sacrificing someone dear to get the soulstone.But what it came down to is the cliched classic jump back in time travel plot, however it wasn't supposed to be like Back in the Future, so they say. But Captain America came back in the same time-line as an old man, so how is that not like Back in the Future?!?Also Captain Marvel was totally hyped, but didn't played much of a role in the entire movie, talk about overhyping it!You see I have been cheated.....and all of you aswell."
1298,"Avengers: Endgame is too farcical and predictable for adults, and too boring for children.The first two hours jump from one uninspired conversation to the next, with little action or sense of purpose. The scenes could be re-arranged randomly without any impact on the story's flow.The only real theme during the first two hours - ""we Avengers are all tired and defeated"" - seems disingenuous. Are we supposed to believe that our ""heroes"" are going to avoid the fight and stay home?Moreover, the actors' ""heartbreak"" feels generic - the cinematic equivalent of ""I feel your loss"" on a Hallmark card. To the contrary, when I observed the actors onscreen - especially when they were all together - the main vibe I got was the irony of ""Ocean's Eleven"".There is no message (aside from a tired redemption arch), whilst the ending is predictable. In fact many scenes are predictable - a good drinking game would be to guess throughout the film what will happen next.The final 45 minutes or so is a CGI mess - one of those headache-inducing battles where the main characters easily kill their adversaries by the dozens.Long live the superhero genre."
1299,An Overrated movie because of marvel fans. Only last 1 hour was good .
1300,"We had 11 years building up to this moment where characters have developed to their best possible selves only to dumb them down more at the last second.Don't even get me started on fat, sloppy, crybaby Thor but the hulk was more useless than in Infinity War. Captain Marvel, who was supposed to be the difference maker, had little to know screen time where she hardly contributed.Obviously, The Avengers come out on top and we all knew this but there were many different directions to make that happen and easily make it spectacular. Bringing time travel into any movie is tricky but when you completely change prior movie's outcomes it left me wondering if the buildup was necessary. Way too many alternate realities created and plot holes that just made for a rushed and confusing plot.Black Widow sacrifices herself to get the Soul Stone and everyone is sad and agrees they can't get her back even with time travel because those were the rules to get the stone. BUT then Gamora who died in Infinity War for the Soul Stone comes back no questions asked!?!Also, really disappointed in Thanos's character. In my opinion he is one of the best villains of all times and an absolute mastermind who was beyond interesting in Infinity War. In Endgame he has zero personality and was all of a sudden more powerful without the infinity stones than with.It felt like they wanted to make this movie as emotional as possible but it was so rushed and confusing that during those death scenes I was just ready for it to be over.Hopefully phase 4 will come back strong with Thor teaming up with Guardians of the Galaxy"
1301,"Long, boring, phoned in with lazy writing. The hard fact is that Avengers Endgame is less entertaining than watching a dog pinch a loaf on your front lawn. It is an awful movie."
1302,"It's like when you meet again after 12 years an old SUPER HOT girlfriend, and she is coming with her 2 children and the first one is 11 years old.
Pfff. I am a big fan of the previous film. This one is a generous 5/10.
Robert D. Jr. is great. And...maybe Thor.The end."
1303,This was the most scatter brained writing for a Marvel movie I've ever seen. Just god awful.
1304,Best film I've ever seen however there was no excuse for Daisy Johnson and Robbie Reyes (arguably the 2 most powerful characters in the whole MCU) to just not turn up at all!
1305,"Main problem with this movie is too much humor it forces you to get through the whole time... Action builds up, heats up, ....killed by an absolutely stupid 'supposed to be funny' joke...this and time travel idea was so lame.. cudnt they think of more out of the box ideas? Of course if you go back in time u will win .. so lame.. and movie runs way too long to give u the nice main actions scene the last hour.. other avengers has more main action sequences than that... Not to mention that they totally destroyed the idea of the hulk once they made him wear freakin glasses and turn him into a smart ass funny character.. last movie doesnt have to be the best... Actually the 10/10 reviews make me wonder... Was I watching the same film? Can the fact that you are a fanboy makes u like sth ridiculous as this?"
1306,I.ll be brief and say some spots were amazing wont spoil but there were times that just totally ruined it ... Captain Marvel and her im the best dead pan delivery was horrendous...and THOR lol wtf happened to that very very poor showing of a bad ass charater who deserved way more then this ..same goes with HULK... was a delight to watch but no way does it capture the pacing and character development of infinity war .. and that battle scene will go down in marvel movie history as one the best epic finales to a movie EVER.... SNAPPP...
1307,Marvel let us down this time for real bad film bad jokes
1308,Worst Marvel Movie. Poetic justice with a absurd plot and messy storyline.
1309,Boreing boreing boreing theyn should have finished the movie in part 1 infinity war......DO NOT WATCH.
1310,"It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10."
1311,There are so many plot holes and movie doesn't even try to explain itself. Waste of my time and money.
1312,"I don't think I've ever felt more out of place in my life than I did in the cinema watching Endgame.Ant man: ""I think I just peed my pants...""Audience: **ROARS with laughter**Not having enjoyed this film has been enough for people to call me ""pretentious."" I guess I can only offer an outsider's perspective - I didn't grow up on superhero movies unlike the rest of the entire human population. Since it's not something that was embedded in my childhood, I have no nostalgia for this series at all. With all the hype, I thought I'd give it a fair go, so I watched every key MCU film in the month leading up to Endgame. As much as I tried to enjoy them, this just really really isn't for me. Unpopular opinions inbound.To this day I'm surprised how much Endgame managed to get away with. From my point of view introducing time travel was a cop-out. Not only is it lazy storytelling (introducing a convenience out of nowhere that basically undoes anything that previously felt significant), but it felt like a fan-servicy excuse to use most of the movie's runtime to recycle old scenes people already loved as forced nostalgia-bait. But apparently it's okay when Marvel does it.As usual, I didn't like the tacky fight scenes, and I found the characters' quips painfully unfunny. There were no tears at any emotional moments, since I didn't manage to develop any attachment to the characters, Thanos being the only one I found mildly interesting. I'm happy to let people enjoy what they do, but the reason this genre makes me angry is because multiple MCU fans I've encountered seem to see these films as the second coming of Christ, and aside from being straight up insulted multiple times for holding these opinions, someone I know once felt the need to give me a literal slap for ""giving endgame a 4/10"" (I wish I was exaggerating). Those are the sad lengths some will go to defend corporate Disney products I guess.That wraps up my strong thoughts. I like fun films every now and then, but not these ones. I'm happy to let people love what they love, as long as they're not entitled prats about it."
1313,"This Is Not A Movie,Not Cinema, This Is A Theme Park"
1314,"This movie was surprisingly boring for the first two hours. Too much talking, tears and drama. The boredom of the drama and the action starts exactly after two hours. I started enjoying this movie only at that point. During the two hours of drama I was constantly thinking whether I should leave, but 12 Euros that I paid made me wait. Being fun of the genre, for me this was not impressible at all. Waste of money and time."
1315,"1. Thanos...In Infinity War they've created the most complete villain in the superhero movie history just to destroy him in Endgame in an instant. Thanos was genuinely build as a complex character and turned into an average villain in this movie.
2. Thor. Why the hell did they mock the best, or one of the best character in the Marvel Univers? They transformed Thor in a drunk, fat, emotional cry baby character.
3. Logic. The movie has no logic regarding the time travel, the stones power, Thor's Mjolnir and so on.Bad. Very, very, very bad. Created for children and money. I was so pleased by Infinity War and so disappointed by Endgame. There are so many negative thoughts about this movie that I cannot describe all of them. They just ruined all!!!"
1316,"Solid 3 out 10.They had one job. Create a great action movie without involving politics..
Really it must've been extremely hard to write a good ending to this series. I did like parts of the ending, but trying to shoehorn in a political message and the additional character cpt marvel just felt so forced and ridiculous it just made me cringe.
There was one scene in particular, and you will know which one I mean when you watch it.
A real shame. It's like the writers were forced to include an element that they really didn't want to have.."
1317,"I've loved every single Marvel movie because they brought about this level of authenticity, humor, love, loss, failure, strength and a sense of unity to us fans. They weren't just movies, they were pure entertainment. Therefore, as much as it hurts me to say this, I was terribly disappointed with this movie.Don't get me wrong, there were moments which got me thinking, 'Ok this is it' , just to be disappointed again. It was terribly funny to Thor looking fat and drunk but he was pretty much useless through the entire movie. He didn't do anything other than sulk and cry. He didn't even use his hammer and it was Captain America that did half the work for him . The entire plot about quantum realm time travelling was so vague that I never understood what was happening. It felt like they thought about time travelling as a last ditch attempt to keep the story going. Hulk was the biggest disappointment of them all. He's supposed to be the strongest avenger, the mightiest and all that. Instead we get a version of ""Best of both worlds"" ??If I have to compare this to any other time travelling movies or shows, let's just say that this movie is the worst of them all. Except for when Tony and Natasha die, every other emotional scene felt forced and fake.With regards to Captain Marvel, they needn't have wasted their money and time with an introduction movie for her because she didn't do anything in this movie. Fine, she blasts through Thano's ship and gives everyone respite from the ceaseless bombings but her only other appearance is twice or thrice. And she's got a cool haircut.."
1318,Roles such as thor and hulk are acted in manner more suited to a looney tunes cartoon. The racoon was the most serious role. Killing Ironman and pretty much killing off Captain America! - not sure who signed off on that but they pretty much have killed the Marvel franchise imo
1319,"An awful repetitive superhero movie. I'm sad that is wasted 3 hours of my life, watching this atrocious movie.Not recommended."
1320,Avengers endgame was a GREAT movie. Mist of the heroes were at their best: Captain america Iron man rocket hawkeye. Thor was GREAT too but he had Just some more kilos. The only negative was hulkin my opinion. But everything else was super this is the Best end in my opinion but we will miss Iron man and captain america.
1321,"I'm a comic guy from way back and don't particularly like the movie versions, so take that for what it's worth.My mistake was seeing it at a midnight showing. I didn't think I was tired, but I guess I was as I ended up falling asleep for about 30 minutes.So here's the bottom line for me. I really don't care about the plot holes. Many reviewers have mentioned them. For me, it's about the scenes. Are they done well? Realistic dialogue? Interesting or exciting action. Actors who are fun to watch. Is this a movie I would watch twice? That is my baseline for any movie to be what I consider ""good""Unfortunately, Endgame fails on all accounts really. It starts off extremely slowly. You could take off the first hour and you wouldn't miss much at all. The action? Nothing really clever or compelling for me. The big Ant Man was kind of cool. Massive amounts of political correctness was expected and delivered, but that will lower ratings for any movie that I watch. Too many wooden characters, however I expect that.In conclusion, I couldn't watch this one twice as it's simply too boring and I like slow paced movies. Too schmaltzy at the end. Yes, it's over, but don't worry though, almost all of these guys will be back, just with different actors playing the roles."
1322,Was well disappointed with this. I liked bits of it but I am finding difficulty recalling them.
1323,"Will probably get killed with dislikes, but hear me out before you come at me:To set things straight; yes this was a good action movie. Was it more than that? Not really. Let me explain why.1. The whole thing about fortnite, hulk-dabs and fatty-Thor was really .. unnecessary. I really love how Marvel use humor in their movies - but this is reaching.2. I love paying for long movies, but I hate checking my watch mid-playtime. It felt like some parts of the movie could've been clipped out to keep the flow going a little better.3. The last fight scene has been named by some as one of the best ever on screen. I have to disagree. The clash was both very messy and clumsy. It was hard to focus on what really happened, and it felt like they had to bring just everything without thinking about how it looked on screen. Personally I felt nothing special about it, and there were really never a point we're i wondered if our heroes would prevail...To sum my review up; Marvel has ended one of their best series, and they did it in a decent way. Sadly it feels like they are trying to please more children, especially when they force stuff like Fortnite and dabbing into the movie. I'm disappointed, but yet I had a good time."
1324,Pretty cheesey and fake. Stupid spandex outfits. Movie should have been about 5 min long it would have been easier to watch
1325,Absolute trash!! The ending was terrible I felt like there was no closure there was so many mistakes it was sooooo cheesy and the storyline was absolute trash. We deserved so much better. Nothing will top infinity war this was an insult. It had its moments but there was very few
1326,"Ive seen all Avengers movies, and yet I havent learned my lesson.... ""These movies are really not for me""... story is super shallow... the ending is so predictable.... im just comparing this trash to the likes of ""The Dark Knight"" trilogy of Christopher Nolan or Spider-Man trilogy of Sam Raimi... these trilogies remain my favorites of all time."
1327,"I have seen all marvel movies except for captain marvel, because of obvious reasons and endgame showed it was justified.
The movie starts off Insanely slow or rather really fast and then 2 hours (what it felt like) slow.
After that the big battle really makes an effort, but really have to shut down your brain, a lot doesn't feel like it makes sense. Then slow again until the end. Some people even cried... Like wtf. And the jokes, omg they were 99
0% horrible. People who voted this movie high are probably the same who laughed at these jokes. It is not an insult when I call them simple minded."
1328,"Endgame feels like it was made by someone who has unending contempt for superhero movies, or finds them so ridiculous as to be undeserving of being taken seriously. The result? Characters, storyline and a Universe it took more than a decade to build destroyed within hundred and eighty odd minutesTo echo Mark Hamil, I fundamentally disagree with every choice made for the direction of virtually every character in the movie. Thor *does not* play Fortnite! He is *not* a fat slob. He most certainly *does not* get 12-year-old panic attacks. The Hulk does not dab. The list goes on and on - to go into all the details would require writing a book.Endgame is an entirely different genre to the rest of the movies(apart from Ragnarok, but I choose to pretend it doesn't exist). Not only is it not a fitting end to the story - it makes a mockery of everything that came before it. This movie does not belong in the MCU."
1329,"The death of Tony Stark was completely unnecessary. They rush the movie at the end. As a fan of Iron Man, this movie didn't made him justice."
1330,"The biggest problem of this movie is time travel. In the End Game, time travel is both ex machina and the driving part of the plot. It was expected to have a time travel element but it took up so much of the movie that it weakened the overall impact of the Infinity set of movies."
1331,The whole movie had only 30 mins total of good scenes. they failed this time...
1332,"For a Marvel movie, this BLUNDERED. It's meant to be the Endgame! The ending everyone's been waiting for! Waiting for the writers to use their magic, but no. The writers got lazy. Time-travel? Are you serious? Time-travel? Despite this obvious critique, I enjoyed it, but it just lacked that typical Avengers magic."
1333,"Being a marvel fan, I've had the best experience of my life watching this movie, what a movie❤❤"
1334,"In 2008, we all embarked on a journey of fantasy and adventure that would redefine the 'super-hero movie' genre, build a world of its own over eleven years and 22 films with beloved comic book characters created by Maestros like Stan Lee, and would culminate to provide what we now know as 'The Infinity Saga' of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
'Avengers : Endgame' is an epic, marvelous, emotional, and hard yet heart-warming conclusion to The Infinity SAGA. A well written and crisp script, a very well crafted character development, bonds and relations between those characters, the dynamics of their situation and how their character arc culminates in the story makes this a powerful movie which is supported by great graphics, action, and Science Fiction Stuff! There is a well maintained balance between action and emotion. The movie provides an emotional roller-coaster ride which makes you experience different emotions like sadness, happiness, hope, surprise, apprehension, disbelief, shock, humor, and keeps you on the edge. You laugh heartily, applaud with enthusiasm, and also sob in sorrow. It's also contemplative and shall provide you with nostalgic moments.
After the devastating snap called 'Decimation' that Thanos did in Avengers : Infinity War, half the life in the Universe is turned to dust, the world is in shackles, and our heroes are left defeated and devastated. But as It's suggest, some people move on... but not them! Thus, the Avengers assemble one last time and are ready to do whatever it takes to make things right and avenge the fallen. Will they succeed? That's what this movie is about."
1335,"This movie is incredible, I watched twice in theatre, This movie helps you to feel, Pain, Anger, Sadness, Happiness. The action scenes were another level even you can't imagine the last fight scenes.I miss you, Natasha,"
1336,This movie is amazing and deserves as much love as it gets 10 out of ten.
1337,"If you're a fan of the MCU obviously you have seen their 22-story entry landmark that is this year's AVENGERS: ENDGAME -- the biggest MCU movie yet, in all of its eleven years of movies. ENDGAME absolutely delivers and pushes so many boundaries and limits. If you set your expectations high you'll still likely be shocked more so than you thought you'd be because of how epic it is. You'd think maybe, just maybe, after three hours you'd get bored but it manages to capture and hold the viewer and provides tons of laughs, action and heartfelt, emotionally-punching scenes throughout its entirety. Act II is great and Act III is by far the best Act of any MCU film to date. The original six Avengers' actors deserve the most praise by all means, and Paul Rudd gives his best and peak performance yet as Scott Lang / Ant-Man. There are so many breathtaking and solid scenes throughout and the movie showcases an abundance of characters, particularly in its closing. You'll see, if by chance you haven't seen it yet.It's as close to a masterpiece as you're gonna get."
1338,"The Movie was more like an ""Infinity War Parody"" movie that the Epic Grand Final.Ok, there was an 8 minutes of action at the end, but nothing like the Plot or the action of Infinity War.There was almost nothing to remember from that movie, except the Black Widows death and the final battle while on ""Infinity War"" I can recall so many Epic Moments. There is no need for a second watch.-Thor and Hulk are more like a Parody than the smart fun quotes or people with psychological problems. Both was wasted in the movie.
They could give us some points using B.A.R.F. for Banners/Hulk problems.-Everything was so easy, 2024 Thanos killed just like that, and everything goes so easy.-So Captain America can have the Power of Old-fathers... Why is that? Ok he can hold Mjolnir but where did he find the Odin Force?-Tony Stark build the Time Machine so quickly and so easy, in just 10sec was render and done. And why? Because Ant-man says that he was 5 hours and for you 5 years. To good to be true, it needs more time just to be believed by the audience. It needs more reactions between Stark and Pym Particle and Ant-man to be more realistic.-Too much useless dialogs to put un in the emotional filings of the characters in the first 1,5 hour they could show are how Banner became Professor Hulk, or they can give more screen time in how Stark build the Time machine or the Stark gauntlet. Why Thanos use Uru metall while Stark just use Vibranium. At least they can use the Uru metall from the old destroyed Mjolnir in Norway.-So Thanos Blade can destroy Vibranium Shield (is his Blade from Uru? ) but If the Shield is broken how Older Captain America got his Shield back again in the End?
Lets say, Old Captain America is from an alternate timeline, so how he is in the same timeline with this one? Was there all the time hidden in all Marvel history?
Captain America was 100 but looks like 30, but he age up only 10 years in 70 years with the serum. So going back to '50s and life his life there now he must be 170, so he mush look like 40 years old, and not like 70 years old. (like Bucky, he didn't age at all, all this years). So Captain America live his life in '50s, '60s, '70s, etc till 2024 he show up with Vibranium Shield.
Where did he fund it? is it from an alternate timeline, and how ends up in that Timeline?-So Nebula from 2024 kills Nebula from 2014 but she doesn't get kill or disappear at all. So perhaps she is from an alternate timeline. But Old Captain American isn't from alternate timeline but his Shield is from alternate timeline. Also, every character that enters the Quantum realm should be an alternate timeline of him self... but they aren't.
So why there is alternate timeline in some characters and alternate timeline in some others. Thats Bad script with lot of Plot Holes.-During the movie lots of the times there was a change in history, but the movie didn't show a clue about them. But still they show to us Older Captain America waiting for them near the lake.-There was no surprise in anything, or nothing Epic at all. Nothing memorial. Just and alternate timeline white-out being into the plot of the other movies.
it would be nice if there was a script that will embed all the timeline of the MCU movies and revail how some things really happent.
They just wrote a script and mess up everything with out count on it, just to have another movie.-So, they broke up all the containers of the Infinity stones... How they are going to take them back ? How they will take Space stone back to '50s without the container?
And if it is an alternate timeline, why they should take them back anyway? Who cares about the alternate timeline... certainly not the Script writers of the movie.-So the Mind stone and the Soul Stones stays on 2024, all others goes back to the past. The Space Stone end up to an alternate timeline to Locki. But Thanos never collect the rest of them so Aether is still with the collector and time stone with Strange. Zandar got the Powerstone.
But still none of them change anything in the timeline but is should... just like Old Captain America was there in 2024.
-The big fight in the end was a big mess. There was two big Ant-mans.
When Thanos Spaceship brake down by C.Marvel it destroys all the Water barrier so everyone should be drawn (Strange block up just a small one before that).-So, if Stark gauntlet is part of Stark Armor and made with Friday AI, Why just don't Friday disassemble the gauntlet and fly away when Thanos wears it?
Anyway, there are so many that I can write. hope in the future Marvel will make a Real Timetravel Movie. That wasn't so real, just an alternate timeline timetravel movie with only Old Captain America as 'Timetravel Paradox'."
1339,"Time travel is mess. Even if we understand their timelines, the bigger mess is Soul Stone.
Nobody knew about the Soul Stone but Nebula. So if 2023- Ronin & Black Widow went back to get the Soul Stone and 2023-Captain America went back to put all the stone the moment they were taken, what does he do with the Soul Stone? He cannot replace Soul Stone with anything but Black Widow. A Soul for a Soul. Remember?"
1340,Whatever I say is a little bit the movie is a failure the worst that Marvel has ever taken.
1341,"Josh Brolin's voice was totally wrong for Thanos. The lips didn't even match the words. I'm also just tired of seeing the SAME old mad man trying to destroy the world and getting defeated by super heroes. Too many characters.At least with the Dark Knight and some of the X-Men films they mixed it up and felt fresh. More superheroes doesn't mean better. Plus the acting was atrocious. The wooden repartee didn't help, done only to make sure everyone gets their lines in.Try a new storyline and/or approach. SKIP IT!"
1342,"An honest review not like the clear fanboys. It is better than Age of Ultron but below Avengers Assemble. Lots of plot holes and some of our favourite characters ruined. Too much humour after the disasterous ending of Infinity War. All that being said it is still a must watch and it will be nice to see the next phase now. I did feel there were too many characters involved and some of our favourite not getting enough screen time. The last 45 minutes is where it is at but i would struggle to watch the movie again, unlike Infinity War which i saw 3 times."
1343,Majorly disappointed. It didn't have as much character development as I would've hoped for M' Baku.
1344,"The movie lacked anything substantial. Infinity war was an epic yet end game tried to cram 21 movies into one. Plot holes everywhere with very little tying the movie together. It was almost too obvious with the direction of the plot. Infinity war had several stories which tied into one, yet endgame tried to do the same but got lost in too much meaningless jokes. Im really sorry for marvel studios but this was by far the worst movie in the marvel universe. Yes the fight scenes were good but the overall delivery was clunky and missing direction. I left the cinema super disappointed as the expectation was hyped up but the delivery was way below that expectation. I watched infinity war 3 times in the cinema, but i wished i waited for DVD for endgame, massive waste of money. Pretty much 2.5 hours of boring jokes and 30 mins of actual viewing pleasure. Anyone who votes this film above 4/10 has issues. The funny thing is, everyone online agrees with me............."
1345,It was very entertaining and had a lot of emotional scenes. Great fighting scenes! You get to see a lot of characters really mature and develop here. I do have a few problems:1. Focused way too much on Captain America. Not a fan that he was able to use Thor's hammer and somehow use lightening and thunder... His ending was very predictable. (He's also quite a boring character)2. The women had about 10 seconds on screen (great addition but literally nothing after that)3. Captain Marvel ?? Where did she go?4. Thor basically retired and was almost useless5. Middle felt like forever and felt like it was mainly Steve and Tony talking. Felt rushed towards the end.6. With the amount of screen time and lines Steve and Tony had.. Honestly this was Civil War 2... Like a make up after fighting each other
1346,"What to say, it's a good movie... Okay? We get it. Lots of big name actors, special effects, and stuff. But c'mon, it's ANOTHER super hero movie, you know what to expect, and you'll have to sit there for 3 hours to get your 1-2 cool scenes that you paid money to see. Having said that, it's a good movie, I don't think anyone will debate that. But I honestly feel like the treatment of some of the characters, what they turned them into for this movie, it just doesn't work for me personally. I think it got RAVE REVIEWS because it's a big achievement, a capstone, a sendoff. And it *IS* a big deal in that way, but as a standalone, objectively-analyzed, critically-evaluated superhero movie, it's just about as good as any of the other dozen or so that came before it."
1347,"Endgame did a lot of great things including breaking the ""formula"" a lot of super hero movies seem to follow nowadays. This being said, it contained some awful story telling and character development.The Russo brothers merely wrote out how they want the movie to end, and made a connection to the present MCU. The movie is completely plot with very little / poor relationships and character development. The gates opened in many times to have a great breaking of relationships and massive character development, but the Russo's instead took those opportunities to make action sequences rather than anything that the audience would feel for more than 3 minutes afterward, a mere portion of an over three hour movie.Also, another point to note, there is a portion of a scene which scream ""women's equality"" at the viewer in the most cheesiest and cliche way which completely breaks whatever connection the viewer is currently having with the rest of the scene. The proper way to handle equality of women in movies is to just make them cool, and not overdo it to the extreme this movie demonstrated.If your a fan of the MCU, definitely watch it. Otherwise I would recommend to avoid it."
1348,"If you've seen and loved all the MCU movies, especially the Captain America focused ones, then you'll probably enjoy Endgame more than I did. I haven't seen them all, didn't care much for the early Avengers movies, and only saw Infinity War on the insistence of a friend. That blew me away, the pacing and the atmosphere keeping me hooked even though I didn't understand all of the references. Yet Endgame, in an attempt to cap the series off properly and pay homage to all the films that lead to it, spends a lot of the 3 hours in the worlds of the older films and getting reacquainted with old characters without really building much of its own story. There's only about 30 minutes of new action and even that, with all its buildup, doesn't beat Infinity War's.As an end to the whole 22 film saga it ticks important boxes for fans, but for those who liked Infinity War in particular and were hoping for a satisfying second part - keep your expectations low."
1349,"This is the superhero movie we have been waiting for
This is Part 2 of Infinity War and it just keeps getting better
Not only this movie will be one of the best superhero movies but one of the greatest movies ever
I don't have anything else to say about this amazing movie
This is a must watch and prepare to be awed by the ending"
1350,"Finally after the 10 year build up, Endgame busts the expectations and as a movie goer Ieaves me satisfied. However, as a fan, severely disappointed. I'm going to deeply analize the 5 points that made Endgame experience a fatality for a long time Marvel fan.
1.Thanos character was reduced to a generic lifeless villian.
Remeber in Infinity War how we could sympathize with Thanos as a character despite his actions and sociopathy? He had a solid motivation and his lines were truly something that made rewatching the film worth it. Endgame literally decapitates him in the first 10 minutes, by our ""heroes"" were he was just making himself a broth with one-arm, to add, at the point it felt the Avengers were just bullying him,again, to add insult to injury as Thor axed him it really felt the movie was portraying the Avengers as the villians.
Then the film decides to place a past Thanos as the main villian, which would have been fine, if he actually had something interesting to say besides that he was going to destroy the whole universe and remake it. As if that wasn't bad enough, if the present Thanos was left alive, it wouldn't have made any difference, to the contrary, it would have been interesting to see what he had to say if he saw past Gamora alive, and make him feel the regret he felt when he won, but then again, we wouldn't have our epic final battle with the explosions and the female power moment, because that's worth the 3 hours.2. The most iconic Marvel characters Hulk and Thor were completely slaughtered and insultingly mocked.
Have you ever wondered how interesting it would be if Marvel made a comic about a videogame playing-basement dwelling Thor and a... I forgot the Professor Hulk comic is actually a thi- Never mind. Point being. Did you love to watch Bruce Banner overcome his psychological fear of controlling the Hulk like in the original Avengers movie? Did you also love how Thor was able to move on from losing his kingdom, his family, and friends and continue his quest for not being a disappointment to Odin in Ragnarok?
Well... throw all of that to the garbage disposal, because this movie gave us FaThor playing Fortnite and Dabbing Professor Hulk instead. I really feel like I shouldn't explain this further, people...3.I thought deaths didn't matter in the MCU?
So let's count the total Infinity War and Endgame death toll... Gamora, many Asgardians and Loki, Vision, Iron Man, and Black Widow, if I forgot anyone else it means I really don't care for them. These are the ones who didn't actually come back to life with the snap. Ok, fine, but why the deaths felt heavier in Infinity War, were we knew they could be brought back, but then they felt out of nowhere in this film? That's it, maybe because the deaths were handled better in Infinity War.
If you rewatch Infinity War, you might notice the characters who saw their loved ones die, had the emotional outbreak we expected they were going to have, making an impact on the audience, there was literally no emotional impact on the deaths scenes of this film, because it felt it had to move quickly to the next scene to make space for the fan service.4.The time travel completely makes the film fall in Men in Black 3 levels of logical inconsistency
So as you might realize, I'm not a fan of time travel in film, unless it follows the Back to the Future formula or the first two Terminator movies, but unless a movie decides to change its rules midway I'll competely disregard the movie as food for thought when it comes to fixing its own plot holes.
For starters, if you're gonna pull the alternate universe travel formula, I'm fine with it, but then you base the science on the fact that Ant-Man traveled 5 years to the future in five hours, but then they come to the conclusion that with such logic they can travel to the past... It's out of nowhere really. You could actually come with a better plot device with the time stone, it was supposed to be there for a reason, Dr. Strange himself gave it away for something, but then you literally use a rat to determine time travel is possible... yeah, what a mess...
As I was saying, if the alt universe in the film was consistent, I'd be fine with it, but then we wouldn't have old Steve Rogers sitting on a bench in the same dimension! Instead of making him teleport back to the platform as an old man, which would have been even better, but then we come to the conclusion that the alternate universe he traveled to is the same one? Nope...
BTW As he is giving his identity to someone else, as a side note, I thought Bucky was supposed to be the next Captain America, you know Steve Rogers' best friend, oh sorry, I forgot there must be a Black Captain America to pander to minorities, would that make me racist, Brie Larson? My bad.
If anything time travel works better in X-Men Days of Future past, because a single character went back in time to a key moment, allowing it to create good scenarios between the characters, Tony could have literally used the time stone to go alone back in time as his young self to the New York Battle and confiscate the stones and destroy them, but then again, we wouldn't have the final epic battle scene, right?5. Captain Marvel
Nothing against our activist and feminist Brie Larson, I'm sure she has made great films in the past, but as you see, I really couldn't understand how her presence was required in this film, as she comes in, leaves during all the second act, then returns out of nowhere and has no weight to the plot of the film.
The thing to like about the Avengers characters is that their interactions and that they have relationships between each other. Captain Marvel has no deep connection with any character on the film whatsoever, hell, she barely has anything to do with the plot more than rescuing Tony from space, which adds to the question, how did she know where to find him? Oh excuse me if I should watch Captain Marvel to know... because I didn't watch it, did that gave me a problem to understand this film? Absolutely not. I fear the reason for her placement was for something other than the fact she's a female, but then again I'd be called a bigot for adding the observation, as I take it back I might add, Thanos really kicked her ass, didn't he? So much for the most powerful Marvel hero.That's my review, I don't think many people will read it, but I wanted to vent the frustration this film gave me, I must add I still enjoyed the film generally as a casual movie goer, I'm glad it exists, and I'm glad people enjoyed it, because it marks the end of an iconic era, and I have hope that filmmakers will move on from the cinematic universe trend and start making movies as their own and admire Infinity War as the pinnacle of such an achievement as nothing will top it. I'm sure Stan Lee is smiling in heaven for that."
1351,"Just like Iron Man 3, there was way too much Disney and not enough super hero. Infinity War was infinitely better (pun intended), and just like the Iron Man series, I've watched the first ones multiple times but the last only once. I won't watch this again and should have waited until it came out on bluray. There wasn't a whole lot that was shocking, a lot was predictable if you've been paying attention, and a lot had too much Disney influence. There were a lot of people in the theater checking their phones and had head resting on their hands before this was even over.
Disney has wrecked another franchise."
1352,This is not a Marvel action movie. Watch only if you are a diehard Marvel stories fan. All the characters are looking tired and slow with no idea as to what they want to do. The movie lacks any serious special effects and is low on the high energy action that you expect from Marvel comics. The movie drags and the end does not end. No way anyone will see this movie a second time.
1353,"Avengers infinity war was one of the biggest, if not the biggest failure and disappointment of the MCU.This film failed to balance action and plot, leaving viewers with no action until the final half hour. The entire first 2 and a half hours consisted of plot to explain how the avengers gained the 6 infinity stones. However, there was so many opportunities of which the movie could've added more action during the collection of the stones. They focussed more on plot than action and failed to make the movie entertaining.With the final (and pretty much the only) fight scene, it felt rushed. Unlike the superb battle of Wakanda in infinity war, the battle at the avengers base gave each MCU main character 10 seconds each to fight, making it feel like it was done straight after starting. The fight scene would've benefitted from being considerably longer and allowing each character to have a proper fight. This fight scene was probably the most exciting point of the film and was short lived.The death of natasha and the retirement of captain America was intended to be tear-jerking but lacked the emotion due to a rushed and failed set up. The death of Gamora was much more successful in the first film.And finally, there was multiple plot points within the film that left large holes. Such as, if the avengers could go back and time and bring gamora from another time line then why not bring back Natasha and Tony from the day before ? Or the I consistent power levels of characters like Thanos, Captain marvel and many others.This film was rushed and was a waste of the $500 million it cost to make"
1354,"The only reason I have this terrible movie a 1, is because I can't give it a zero. I don't know what I was thinking watching this, but it was awful, just a waste."
1355,"Its probably the first marvel movie where i was playing with my phone and that says a lot.
Its a boring movie, full of plot holes, only 20min of fight scenes in total and drama. LOTS and LOTS of drama, moaning and crying again and again.So, to sum it up:
* Plot holes not even the biggest fans can ignore.
* Inconsistencies between the movies.
* Way too many characters, just to appear on the movie, doing basically nothing.
* Huge changes to main characters, making them also useless.
* Almost no fight scenes! Set the alarm clock after 120min in the movie.
* Drama, crying, moaning, REPEAT.You have been warned, but it doesn't matter because you will ignore all the negative reviews and still go and see the movie. That's what i did, the same mistake. Go grab a pizza and watch Arrow, trust me you'll have better time."
1356,"I buy the films I enjoyed, Ragnarok and quite a few of the other May Among others . This one was more of a phone in, yeah it tied up the series, but it really felt like we have to do this to get it done. I can't argue the storyline needed to go the way it did but some of the characters who were immensely powerful , seemed lessened against Thanos .There was very little humour or byplay in itI look forward to the inevitable internet remake that cuts the last two movies in to one."
1357,"I remember when HULK movie came with Eric Bana featuring and after Edward Norton came as a HULK replacing him, after seeing those movies there was nothing on my mind a bunch of superheroes and villains will appear along with HULK. Not to mention The Fantastic Four. When I saw those movies i am very much satisfied not very too much of people gathering around for one cause and will be fighting for it. Separate character in a individual timeline satisfied me in all way. When Iron Man movie released , hey there comes an another guy.. and i seriously swear i thought this will be like previous movies. Instead Nick Appears in the post credit scene in the second part of Iron Man . Even Tony Stark appears in post credit scene in the Incredible hulk movie speaking to the General guy in a bar, i thought two geniuses are gonna do something, but that was just left there and these screenwriters comes up with a gigantic story from Iron Man 2 movie they think they can handle it. did they ? or they are too amateur to handle it ! thinking of they would have taken care of in a better way instead they rushed it in a way to end it like an ending which we all seen in porn movies.Expression was quite opposite way..."
1358,"If you are in your 20s, well, you might love this movie. If you are in your 30s like me, god I can´t even begin on how much of a disapointment this movie is. At least MCU is over now. No need for us that started this back in Iron man in our early 20s to keep up with all the non stop movies shoved at us.GL next generation, hope you enjoy the new Universe. Because after this, I am done."
1359,"I went to cinema expecting an epic conclusion of the story. What I got is a bad scripted, awful mix of characters with bland actiing (credits to some of them who were good) and half an hour worth of watching. End of it."
1360,"I can understand the feeling of MCU fans but the movie didn't have the impact, as IW. I didn't expect IW to be a good movie, so I had high hopes from Endgame, but it didn't turn out to be that great. Acting was spot on, but felt draggy in between with jokes here and there. War sequence was rushed, there wasn't any wow factor in during that scene. Ending was fine. Ye fans would love it."
1361,"I spent the first half convincing myself that Thor really did chop off Thanos head in cold blood and rage.
One guy in Gotham used to say: killing one people will make you kill 100 more, that makes you nothing different than them."
1362,"Infinity War excelled through pacing, structure, suspense, brutality and well-crafted villains. Marvel films tend to be mediocre 'watchable' flicks, so it was a huge shock to see an entry so significantly above the others.Endgame threw all that aside, and stamped on it. The pacing is all over the place, the structure feels like 50 writers tried to shove in different segments, with one editor desperately trying to piece it all together into some form of narrative which made an acceptable level of sense, sort of, kinda...The great Thanos is now a pointless character who's done his job and doesn't care anymore, so pointless in fact, they have to go back to the past to find one who does. Neither him nor his guards are in any way intimidating this time round, we've seen it all before as they'd already won. Why are they fighting again? They won! It's like cheating in a game if things don't quite go your preferred way, so you keep replaying segments until the outcome is satisfying for you. Story telling at its very worst.Time travel made the whole thing feel cheap, rehashed and undeserved. Who cares about the soul stone sacrifice? We've seen it before, get on with one of you dying. Why get excited for the final battle? (with no build up or suspense, the characters just suddenly appear), we've seen it before - they lost. I've absolutely no idea why Captain Marvel was in the film - possibly the most awkwardly written-in character ever. Did Tony Stark really need to sacrifice himself? The battle was well in their hands by that point! Just stall the big purple thing which is somehow destroying everyone without the stones.So why the high rating? Well nostalgia, 11 years of build up and fan service is enough to make the majority look the other way. I'm sure the studio know this was a messy effort, and can't believe they've got away with it."
1363,"1. Unlike any preceding MCU movie, this is very unfocused and for the first time ever felt like fanboy-made movie, that has a severe lack of logic even for fiction.
2. Thanos is reduced to Steppenwolf with better CGI. I AM WORLD CONQUERER MAAAN type thing.
3. Professor or Doctor Hulk is just there. Why did they even bother with Hulk can't come out stuff in IW.
4. Making an Infinity Gauntlet is so easy that Stark cooked up one quickly. Oh and BTW, he also developed a stabilizer for time-travelling in one night.
5. We were told in these movies that even beings of extraordinary strength would be incinerated if they even held one infinity stone. Never mind... Hulk loses an arm. But Tony just uses it and even though he dies later, he is physically okay looking.
6. Killing yourself in your past doesn't have any consequence on you.
7. THOR IS REDUCED TO A DRUNKEN MESS. Odin said Thor didn't need any weapons to be the God of Thunder. But Thanos defeated him in IW. So he forged a new axe and nearly killed Thanos. Fine! Now, he is this drunkard, goofy, devil-may-care kind of idiot who cannot hold against Thanos with both Storm Breaker and Mjolnir; while Thanos doesn't even have any stones. Plus Thor is assisted by Iron Man and Cap. And by the end, he gives the leadership to Valkyrie because he is too lazy and she is better in every way. I remember in Ragnarok that even when Thor insisted on going back to Asgard, she was drinking and lazy and stubborn and working at Sakaar. Now she is great leader. Plus where did she get her Pegasus back?
8. Peter goes to high school and every one of his classmates also were conveniently dusted for 5 years, I guess, judging by FFH trailer.
9.This timeline has two Captain Americas... I guess??
There are a lot of things, but I will stop at that...I think Marvel has done a good job over the last few years to dumb down the audience to laugh and cheer at everything. BCoz people were laughing at so many inappropriate moments.
Also all-women team up against Thanos. Just to show to the audience, not because of plot reasons.
Stay home and save the money. Or if you don't care, then watch and enjoy whatever. Sure there are fun moments here and there. Any previous MCU movie was better than this one's plot.
Fan service, THE MOVIE."
1364,"Yes, it's fancy colourful movie with superheroes you love. That's it. I'll admit I love that they tried to do time travel, but sadly it could've have been much better, I wish movie used much more interfierance to those previous movies. Jokes are kindergarden level, even 1st graders make better jokes than Marvel. They made Thor fat, ruined character possibly forever. And he was playing FORTNITE, out of all games they had to make Thor a filthy casual, I wish they used some obscure game instead so some nerds could have been pleased, instead of kids. I'll admit action scenes were great, but majority of characters were so underused, many of them got only 3 seconds of footage for whole battle. Whole movie is centered on few characters only. Also the ending is overdramatic only biggest fanboys could fall for it."
1365,My first ever review - i went to this in theaters because I heard the hype and had one co worker tell me he thought it was a '9.2' out of 10.Compared to the first this was wildly mediocre. Overall an okay film but I was honestly very excited for it to be over after three hours. They could have done much better.
1366,"This was absolutely the best possible way the universe could of ended. Acting was amazing, directing flawless. 10/10"
1367,"Story well developed, and ending convincing and very touching. Just too sad to see Black Widow's and Iron Man's personal sacrifice and the effects of aging on Captain America's handsome face!"
1368,"I'm not really sure how to put it. Maybe all the hype made it impossible for it to live up to the standards I expected of it, but this movie was not worth the wait.Captain Marvel ruins the whole movie for me. She just walks in and makes it look like this is some easy ass everyday thing, flying through the aircraft or casually coming to earth carrying a spaceship. She feels way to powerfull, talking about ""lets get the stones"" or ""I know people who may know where he is, I'm just gonna go kill him. K bye"". It's like playing a game on GodMode and it all feels like a really cheap and lazy way to end the franchise.The action scenes were amazing but there are very few of them. The end battle was great, until a certin someone showed up and flew through the giant alien spaceship like a hot knife carving through whipped cream.The majority of people seem to love this movie, and I just don't understand it. What really ruined it for me was Captain Marvel and Brie Larsons stupid IDGAF face. I hate Larson for ruining this movie. I was really hoping for Captain Marvel to die. That was the biggest disappointment of it all, that she didn't."
1369,The ending is good but u can do it better. Bottom line-I need iron man back to give 10/10.
1370,"I understand that people really likes the movie, but in no world this movies is better or as great as the godfather, the dark night or pulp fiction. You all are overrating this movie"
1371,No idea where what everyone else watched but this movie was bad. A million questions unanswered and the solutions used were the worst. Not going to spoil but you'll see.
1372,Basically there was 2 hours of crying then action then 30 minutes of action and finally topped it off with 30 more minutes of more crying! I fell asleep at the beginning! Infinity war was a much better movie!
1373,"I love most Marvel movies but every now and then along comes a dud. These usually occur when the powers that be think more is best. The convoluted time travel plot seemed like a clever approach but soon fell apart and became messy. Thor was reduced to a joke, Captain Marvel was an anticlimax (hated her movie) and the Banner/Hulk never got to throw a punch. I know that the 10 star ratings massively outnumber all the others put together. But unlike the last three Avengers movies, Endgame isn't one I'm bothered about seeing again.
A disappointing end to an otherwise amazing movie journey."
1374,"Only the final fight is good, remaining movie is all too much emotional drama for a Marvel movie."
1375,It was entertaining but the only action was towards the end drawn out at the beginning but the ending killed the movie for me I prefer something that leaves viewer something that's uplifted they killed off my favorite characters
1376,"Left the cinema disappointed!Not a patch on infinity war - in fact I would of preferred finishing the franchise with infinity wars ending! Ragnorak had natural humour - they tried forcing humour into this and it went down like a lead balloon!Predictable drivel focussing on boring characters - how are people giving this over a 5? Made a mockery of the 21 films before it - hulk and Thor's character????? Ridiculous!Avengers infinity war 9/10
End game 2/10Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
1377,"First 90 minutes was boring, sulking around, listless, no action.The action was compressed into the last 8 minutes and was just a 'showcasing' of many MCU superheros, as though they needed schmaltz and sadness as a plot point. Nothing epic came to play, no appearances of any surprise characters (like Galactus), or any surprises at all, and the twists were pointless (Black Widow and Ronin both trying to sacrifice themselves then swapping back and forth).There was a lot of promise and possibility but I think the screenwriters just phoned it in, predictable and tedious.Rewatchability? About 2/10. I don't think I'll bother watching it again. Why?I can't believe the 1,244 people who gave this a 10. They're delusional"
1378,"It's literally almost a year ago to the day that I returned home after seeing Infinity War where exactly what I feared would happen did. I.E. meaningless deaths that meant nothing (Gamora, Loki, ALL the heroes who vanished after the snap), as well as a painfully predictable ""Part 1"" cliffhanger ending that copied the decades old comic book storyline beat for beat. In short, Infinity War was a MASSIVE disappointment overall.And now a whole year later......we have Endgame. Which featured NO obvious deaths, NO copying of any existing comic book storyline, and also managed to be the single most gratifying and well executed ending to a long-running franchise in all of cinematic history.Long story short......Endgame >>>>>>>> infinity WarThe year long wait to finally get it right was worth it.10"
1379,"Personally I found it mediocre at best. Too many contradictions to count. So thors hammer DOES grant him the power of lightning? I know Odin tells thor that it doesn't give him those powers but only helps him channel them, so what, cap has had that ability the whole time but saved it or never knew till now? And what's with the whole changing the past doesnt change the future? How does anything they do then accomplish anything. And why does nebulas eye thing just conveniently decide to play the most incriminating thing possible, when it could play anything in reality. I'm glad at least that the 1 dimensional captain marvel was not present most of the film, that at least was a plus. And further more, why was tony seemingly un injured from the stones, yet died? Is he a god and we never knew? Half god quil was nearly turned to ash from just one in seconds, tony used them all. I just dont how they ended up deciding to go down some of these paths. It's like they never saw any of the past movies. And hulk?bruce? Beta Hulk? What ever he is, he managed to find a way to be more useless than in the last film. Seriously what did he even do other than the first fix snap? Why not let thor do it, I think he could take the power of it if he can handle the full force of a stars radiation in the vaccum of space. And then cap just stays in the past like an a hole and watched all this horrible stuff unfold? How did any of the events that led up to it happen then with out him? They never needed him at all? And if you cant change the past, then how does he stay and literally change the past by being in it? Too many self creating paradoxes that they basically tell you to screw yourself if you start asking ""wait but why....?"" All in all, I think what we experienced here is they peaked with infinity war, and cant make something as good. I mean cmon, thanos had the personality of a lobster in this film. It felt like we were dealing with an unknown enemy, yet we do know him.... and Gamora died in infinity war yet never comes back? Why? Because it was the soul stone thst she died for? Then arent you changing the past by removing that Gamora from the time line? And why is Thor like a broken sexual assault victim, hes the GOD of thunder for crying out loud. and why does Thanos' most impractical weapon ever, his double sided sword thing, just absolutely demolish cap's shield? Did Tony give him a fake lol? And we get to see Loki grab the tesseract and vanish, and we never see the follow up to that? What a loss of a good plot line, follow lokito find it and enlist his help against thanos. HOW DOESNT IT CHANGE ANYTHING?!?!?! Seriously it just seems like lazy writing on their end more than anything else. Like someone got half this plot and someone pointed out, hey changing the past changes the future you know, so they were like ahh crap that's right, well, just have beta hulk give some science nonsense spiel about it and that should clear things up. And if taking past gemora to the future to replace the one they lost works fine..... why doesnt anyone go grab the Tony from before he left to get the stones? If changing the past doesnt change the future, how does it stop him from sacrificing himself? Same goes for black widow. The final battle seen wasnt that great either, I like my fair share of female super heroes but just the whole girl squad assemble thing was a little too much, like they all conveniently ended up in the same place at the same time, cmon we all know you just wanted you PC plug, you guys are more creative than that, that was just desperate and laughable. I'm a big fan of marvel movies, and to be fair this one had the most to live up to, but I still feel like they didnt do it justice. Perhaps they shouldve taken more time between films. Oh well. If the spider man movie is no good as well, I think I'll be parting ways with marvel films."
1380,"Unsure about other reviewers, but I was disappointed.Two of my favourite Avengers: Hulk and Thor, had completely different personalities. Hulk as a geek and Thor completely wasted until the very end was underwhelming.Captain Marvel was overpowered - she destroys Thanos ship in 10 seconds.No role of Dr. Strange. Too much airtime was given to 'moments'.Overall, the movie was made to achieve commercial success, but lost its Marvel soul.I doubt I'll watch it again..."
1381,So so over hyped a bit above average but far too long. The hype here is real thank goodness I only paid $5. Wait for it come our on Firestick.
1382,"First of all it's a very loooooooong movie. 3 hrs.
I was waiting for this one for months now, so excited at what was going to come. But Alas.. What a mess.
The first hour is a complete boring time of them showing what the world has come to. I mean quite boring with slight humor.
Second hour, the movie starts picking up, with more content (confusing time travel) and some good humor.
The last hour (like when you are actually asking where's the action, where are the effects, 3D etc), it's starts to show some hope. And some action starts. Gets you going.. For a bit.. And then it ends.
The action is hardly there.. Whatever is there is forgettable. Nothing worth like the earlier ones.
Overall the movie is not a little below average, with nothing memorable in it. I can't believe the business is done.
I came home and had to watch Infinity War to get over this one. And believe me folks... Infinity War was way better than this. Way way better with its story and action.
Don't waste your money on this melodrama.. Watch it on TV when it comes..."
1383,"Extremely overhyped movie, loved by marvel fanboys only. Its insulting to say that its the best movie ever, if that was the case, human race would have failed and we all should be killed by a meteor."
1384,"How can you disrespect Thor the way they did in Endgame. Making him fat, lazy and AFRAID! This is not the Thor we knew and loved. Then, they attempt to give us ""Professor Hulk"" but the dude is too self-conscience to smash literally anything throughout the movie. Two movies in a row with no Hulk is unacceptable. Hawkeye becomes a deranged assassin, Captain Marvel has about 2 minutes of screen time, and then they make Sam the next Captain America over Bucky?! They tried too hard to be funny and they ruined it. If you're just an average Marvel fan, you will no doubt love this movie. But for me, it was slow and far too easy through and through. 3 hours for only 10 minutes of action? No thanks."
1385,"It's not because I hoped it's not going to be time travel involved (also it's weirdcbringing all back not to the moment of first snap but five years after the decimation) and I could easily overlook some not so great things (like Captain America suddenly holding a Mjolnir, fatty Thor...) or nonsenses, some plot holes, sappy scenes like with all female heroes suddenly fighting together and other minor nonsense in Endgame, but why I'm really disappointed:
the fighting at the end was coming suddenly and was quickly over without any real figting scenes where at least the original Avengers could show they ful powersProfesor Hulk ok, but I realy hoped to see angry Hulk coming out and making a big impact in some major moment to save the day to correct his impression from Infinity WarI hoped Stark would slightly upgrade his Iron Man suit and deliver a revenge fight with Thanos and beat him down and defeat him this way - I really hoped to see Iron Man fighting in all of his glory for the grand finale of Avengers/Iron Man!!and I hoped Iron Man is not going to die at the end!! (yes, happy end for Tony Stark ;)
I was really surprised how good Infinity War was, everything (characters, story, fighting scenes, Thanos) was perfectly balanced there, I really couldn't imagine someone will make such good movie story arc like Marvel did, that's why I couldn't believe it the Endgame will end that shallow..."
1386,"""It wasn't as good as Infinity War."" That was all I could say as I stumbled home after two in the morning. It's taken some time, but I'm starting to understand why.The biggest problem I had with this film was how all the superheroes seemed to act as if ""The Snap"" happened only to them and no one else. The entire first act shows the cast depressed because they lost, and because of who they lost among their group. While this is understandable, it seems to be the only thing they care about. They only want to avenge the loss of their own loved ones, not the horror suffered by the rest of Earth.This isn't just my interpretation of the writing - the effect on the rest of humanity is almost completely hidden from view. As to the larger global cataclysm, we only get a few glimpses - Hawkeye's family, a memorial in San Francisco, a few people who show up to Captain America's grief counseling group. Other than that, we're merely told about the larger effects of that moment, such as when Black Widow states the Earth's governments are in ruins. It too well concealed the terror suffered by so many others on Earth, as if the writers themselves weren't sure how to convey the magnitude of the act.At the same time, the film assumes the surviving humans all know that Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet were the reason behind half of the world disappearing. This raised several questions:First - how would they know that? Was humanity ever told that Thanos would wipe out half of existence if The Avengers failed? Do they even know what the Infinity Gauntlet is? Who would've been there to see it when it happened outside Wakanda's secluded African community? When people saw others turn to dust, wouldn't they think it was terrorism, a plague, or something entirely different?Second, if they were told, who did it? How did everyone react when they heard? And wouldn't they be upset at The Avengers for failing to stop Thanos? Why, five years later, would some kids walk up to The Hulk and take a selfie with him as if nothing had happened? You'd think our heroes would have been chased into hiding, not hanging out in their perfectly functioning headquarters to quip at each other.Much like ""The Dark Knight Rises"" and the Anime ""Sword Art Online,"" ""Endgame"" relies on a sudden jump forward in time to avoid answering these and other compelling questions. It is in the five years after ""The Snap"" that we could have learned more about humanity's response to the disaster, and how if at all The Avengers were blamed. After all, we know from the very beginning of the MCU, when Tony Stark reveals his secret identity, that humans know superheroes exist. It's these interactions between humans and the heroes that have driven much of the narrative in the MCU.But instead, at this most critical time, we're simply moved ahead to a moment of tenuous calm, thus allowing the Marvel brand of humor to continue despite the unfathomable tragedy. To the film's detriment, this isn't the most interesting time for the story to take place. And to make it worse, humanity has absolutely no role in shaping the narrative of the story. We're not even certain everyone comes back after The Avengers craft a gauntlet of their own - it's all done symbolically, without any of the emotion or consequence.As if gripped by the same depression of the film's characters, we're then thrown head-long into a ridiculous time travel plot that fills the film's second half. Thanks to the film's greatest hero - a rat - Ant-Man returns from out of nowhere, and while stuck in the Quantum Realm also seems to suddenly understand everything about time travel despite being a common thief. Tony Stark's concept of building a time machine also comes to him from out of nowhere. It would've been interesting to see this plan be an act of desperation by brutally depressed characters, all of them knowing the act is impossible, but just looking for something to do.But, of course, it works, and the film then partakes in its true passion - celebrating the MCU itself. Like a terrible clip show from a long-running show, much of what follows is everything you've already seen from nearly two dozen films, re-enacted all over again. It's quaint for hardcore fans of the series, but for me, it left me wondering if something more interesting could've been done in its place. The film can't even escape making the same mistake so many other films do by couching their time-travel plan in terms of still other movies, like ""Back To The Future"" and even ""Hot Tub Time Machine.""The inevitable over-indulgent fight signals the end of the film, featuring a chorus line of all the characters coming back as if preparing to take a final bow. It's the big applause moment of the film, but somehow still comes off rushed. We don't get any understanding of what it was like when each of them came back, and what effect it had on their loved ones left behind. We don't understand - other than a few lines from Spider-Man - what it felt like to be one of the murdered from Infinity War. It's at this moment you realize why they didn't show anyone else come back after the second ""Snap"" - once again, humanity took a back seat to allow the superheroes a dramatic entrance. But, for a three-hour film, it really lacked the weight the writers were clearly going for.In the fight itself, we're treated to many absurdities. The maligned Captain Marvel, who after nearly ending the film all by herself in the first five minutes literally told the audience ""you're not going to see me for a while,"" shoots in from out of nowhere and effortlessly destroys a ship, just as she had in her own film. She then joins a group of female superheroes who pointlessly pose for a moment, then unlike the male characters screaming and attacking, choose to scream and attack. On top of this ""Force Is Female"" crap, the whole sequence is shot like a DC fight scene, complete with an ugly brown filter over the colorful characters. But, hey, when it's all over, Thanos gets to die a second time.To round things off, the film follows ""Star Wars: The Last Jedi"" in gleefully letting the past die. While Iron Man gets an epic and dignified death - unwillingly, having started a family of his own - others aren't so fortunate. Captain America voluntarily becomes old, handing over his shield to his black friend Falcon. More wokeness ensues when Thor, transformed by depression into ""The Big Lebowski,"" hands over the keys to his sad little village to the Valkyrie woman from ""Ragnarok"" who can't act. One after the other, your favorite superheroes survive their greatest challenge only to voluntarily give up the reigns to a group far less interesting or talented. Then the actors sign their names ""Star Trek"" style, you wait 11 minutes for no after credits sequence, and its finally time to go pee.Once again, even in this biggest and most anticipated superhero film, this is yet another example of writers not taking the time to play with an idea and make their story the very best it could be. It's not a terrible film, but it's not a complete one, either. Tragically caught between racial and sexual politics, rabid fans, and Disney corporate, it lets a little too much of the outside world water-down a good story."
1387,"What a load of bs. What was this? The writers of this movie should never be given jobs again. The first two hours were a complete and total waste of time. A better story line would have made this the movie we all wanted, 2 hours long with a 45 minute fight scene. But you couldn't be bothered to do this could you? You wrote the movie YOU wanted. Not what we wanted. Screw this over-elaborate, slow moving piece of absolute garbage!"
1388,"Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some."
1389,"Yeah I was highly disappointed in this movie. It didnt deliver on anything I hoped for. I wanted to like it too. I dont even like to talk bad on these movies because we are lucky enough just to get these characters on the big screen, but this was easily my least favorite marvel cinematic universe movie. I hate to say it but my top 5 least favorite comic movies are probably now...
1. Batman and Robin
2. Batman v Superman
3. Justice league
4. Green lantern
5. Avengers endgame
6. (Incase you were wondering) Thor: darkworld"
1390,"Endgame is a good movie, but not a great one.Is it a fitting end for the 20+ movies, hell yes, but still it´s falls short in way too many areas.The plot is what all thought it would be about, with some small twists, but the first 1,5 maybe 2 hours could have been much shorter.When things start to pick up, and we get the epic show down... well... It´s one big LET DOWN :(Again it´s a good movie, but great.... no way.
It´s really a disappointing ending to so many great Marvel movies, as the big battle is over and done before it even starts.Maybe I had too high expectations, and many will disagree, but damn im bummed out about the ending."
1391,"Very poor movie filled with plot holes. May be they wanted to release the movie soon and hence decided, lets have a grand CGI fight, some humor, use complicated words and hype it so much that people will say it was good (May be pay the critics?) It goes in the list of bad comic book movies. If your only exposure to comics is through Marvel movies, may be you will like it. I think most people will watch it just to see how they attain closure to the fantastic movie timeline, time and money spent is not going to worth it though."
1392,"Good CGI, script is built up on a lack of basic logic and reasoning. Then again... is it that big of a surprise? Love this somewhere in the 300-400 range."
1393,"What I'm mad about the most is the fact that now I am too disgusted to watch a movie from the past again and i have watched most of them 2-3 times already. Way to ruin everything.
I think introducing Captain Marvel was the worst decision. Black Captain America will never make the screens and i doubt they can make a Natasha movie DC dark."
1394,"It was ok. Kinda dragged, felt a little hamfisted at times, was extremely deliberate, and the ""solution"" felt contrived and far too easily stumbled upon. I know people are going to give this movie great reviews because they're huge marvel fans or whatever, but looked at objectively, it's just kinda ok."
1395,"Just came home from seeing this movie and i have to say what a HUGE letdown...
Too long, unnecessary time travel nonsense and plot holes galore. I left this movie asking myself why? How? When? What? It overshadowed the good points of this movie far too much. It's unfortunate, if you ""turn your brain off bro"" its fine but if you question anything in this movie it'll ruin everything. I give it 3 stars only because the cgi was great and the acting was nice but literally everything else was no-go.I would have believed some super elder god being like the Eternals more than time travel that ????doesn't???? Alter the future??? It was a h o t mess. Terribly executed"
1396,"""This is going to work, Steve.""""I know it will. Because I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.""So spoke Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) to Captain America (Chris Evans) in the opening act of Avengers: Endgame. Quite poetically, leading into this crossover event, the above interaction no doubt reflects the minds of all Marvel fans flooding to see Endgame in the coming weeks. Naturally, fans are longing to watch their favourite characters together on screen for one last blast, but also desperate that the conclusion to this incredible 11-year journey lives up to expectations.Endgame's prologue sees our heroes defeated; Thanos' (Josh Brolin) infamous finger-snap at the end of Avengers: Infinity War - coined officially as 'The Decimation' - has wiped out half of all living creatures in the universe. Now, the Avengers must unite one more time to reverse this grave catastrophe, ""whatever it takes.""So, has Marvel managed to make this overwhelmingly ambitious project ""work""? The short answer: yes. Infinite times over, yes. Avengers: Endgame is not only a truly engrossing culmination to the 'Infinity Saga', it is also nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.The journey that began with Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in Iron Man back in 2008 is very intelligently tied up in Endgame. As the film unfolds, Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely's meticulous story planning becomes evident and gradually proves to be the most satisfying payoff any Marvel fan could have hoped for. Marvel President Kevin Feige alongside directors Anthony and Joe Russo have completed an impossible feat; Endgame is humorous, heart-breaking and perpetually captivating. It more than exceeds any presupposition laid before it with a swagger more equanimous than Stark's ego, whilst also moulding an open route forward for the inevitable continuation of this formidable franchise. It's one-of-a-kind experience; the perfect milestone to end this gigantic adventure, yet a glorious beginning for the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Endgame's greatest filmic achievement though, lies in its steady pace and indulgent narrative; taking things slow but never wasting time, yet speeding along whilst never rushing, everything fits perfectly into place in this 3-hour work of genius with a sophistication indicative of a Francis Ford Coppola paragon. Sure, it's a high-budget superhero blockbuster featuring spectacular special effects, but as Marvel has proven before, that doesn't mean a superhero film cannot tackle tones and styles not necessarily affiliated with the genre. In the realisation of its ambition, Endgame catapults the superhero genre to an unprecedented spectrum of film accomplishment; it is quite frankly a piece of cinematic art, encapsulating yet conquering all that has come before it with majesty and self-assuredness.But as noted by Stark, ""part of the journey is the end"", and now the curtain draws on this dazzling superhero adventure. Though the encore of 'Phase Three' is yet to be seen in Spider-Man: Far From Home (releasing this July), Avengers: Endgame is a magnificent finale which allows The Avengers we so know and love the opportunity to sign off in remarkable fashion, leaving behind a Hulk-sized stamp on Hollywood history which will remain for 'infinity'.Avengers... Assemble. And take a bow."
1397,It's just one big mess and I fell asleep. I kept wondering what was even happening??
1398,"Thor became an idiot (constant comic relief), the Hulk became a wimp. Most characters had very little parts. The story line was jumbled. I had really high expectations and perhaps that is the reason for my disappointment."
1399,"Firstly, let me start off by saying that I know it must be difficult to get the balance right for a film with so many characters.One of the reasons the original 'Avengers Assemble' movie was so good, was because they did just that. They had different tiers of bad guys, so Thor & The Incredible Hulk (class 100 characters in the Marvel Universe), were fighting the big guns (Loki and the biggest flying aliens), whilst Captain America & Iron Man dealt with the smaller guys and stopped the nuke.This unfortunately didn't happen in Age of Ultron where you had Hulk and Thor fighting exactly the same enemies Black Widow & Hawkeye, but they seemed to get back on track in ""infinity Wars' with Hulk fighting (briefly) and losing to Thanos, as did Thor & Loki.That's okay though, Hulk would surely get his revenge in End Game... right?WRONG!The hulk doesn't even have a fight!!!! Arguably THE strongest being in the marvel universe with immeasurable strength and the 'strongest there is' and he doesn't even throw a punch... not once in the entire film!!!!Everything he does Banner could have done and even Ant Man had to save him from drowning...I mean ffs!!!Marvel have totally undervalued the Hulk and he may as well have not been in the last 2 films.Captain America picks up Thor's Mjolnir and not only that but can all of a sudden summon Thunder & Lightening too.Thanos is able to fight and defeat Thor, Iron Man, Captain America and Captain Marvel... even WITHOUT the infinity stone glove.There's not one memorable fight scene in the entire film and the person who gives Thanos the longest fight is (class 10 rated) Captain America.The only memorable scene is with Black Widow & Hawkeye which is well done, but that aside this movie really offered little of substance and is totally forgettable.The story was like something you get watching a cartoon for young children on morning TV.The Banner/Hulk thing was fine, but if there was a comic called the Incredible Banner, no one would buy it.It's the HULK who is 'incredible' and he's totally marginalized for the entire movie, just to make Mark Ruffalow's acting 'shine'.A really, really disappointing film and that there are so many 10/10 reviews on here is baffling and I can only assume they have been written by the children this film was aimed at.A real shame as infinity Wars had set this up perfectly.Avengers Assemble 9/10
Age Of Ultron 6/10
Infinity Wars 8/10
End Game 4/10"
1400,"You wont miss anything entertaining. I didnt know what to expect from this final film, but I certainly wasnt expecting to watch arguably the slowest moving Marvel movie ever made. Does it make up for it in that one epic fight scene? not really. So many other movies have done epic battles far better than this. Now I cant sleep properly cuz I got so much rest during Endgame!"
1401,"A movie with a great closing, but that has many plot holes the truth is not on par with its predecessor Infiniti war, you should not let yourself be carried away by fanaticism is a good movie but leaves much to be desired"
1402,"I won't spoil the movie....Endgame is terribly paced with actions that exist only to further the plot. Most character development is told to the audience instead of experienced. The movie breaks its own stated rules and character scaling makes no sense.If you turn off your brain and stop asking questions of what is transpiring on screen, then yes you will enjoy the movie.But if you ask even one question, you will become terribly frustrated and taken out of the movie. A film, no matter how fanciful, should suspend disbelief speaking to either real world logic or the logic it establishes in its own narrative. There is none of that, characters survive and perform actions only for spectacle and because it serves the whims of the writer not the story.Fans frankly deserve better."
1403,"Infinity war was very good, had solid direction, acting from Brolin, and many genuinely moving moments. There was also plenty of comedy, but also plenty of awesome scenes, mainly involving Thor. There was also lots of great character moments.Endgame ruins everything from Infinity war from the opening bell. It seems they have forgotten how to make movies. The direction and acting is awful, attempting to be serious and have drama, but failing miserably. On almost every technical category I would give this movie a C, direction, acting, editing, score, cinematography, etc.The battle scenes are just so awful, boring, ugly, lacking an weight, or pace, or anything. The only American director I have seen pull off large battles well is Mel Gibson in The Patriot, We Were Soldiers, and Hacksaw Ridge.The central plot of this movie is a huge derivative mess, with the plot to get the infinity stones to bring people back lifted whole cloth from Dragon Ball Z (gather those dragon balls and make a wish), and the time travel... Where to begin.The time travel plot they attempt to be clever by saying time travel doesn't work this way or that, but then go on to make a huge mess of any kind of logic or consistency. They basically just use multiverse theory (ala dragon ball) but then have huge holes throughout. Having seen quite a few excellent takes on time travel, this has to be the most lazy.Speaking of time travel, that whole section of the movie is just a huge waste of time revisiting the events of past movies, which I see what they were attempting, but just because you have lofty reasons in your head for doing something doesn't make it any less of a poor decision. They thought they were being poetic by heavy handily reminding the audience of the past and tying it together, but that is the most brute force way you could possibly tie the past to the future, by having the characters go back there. Was there nostalgia? Was there warm feelings of seeing those things again? honestly not for me. I don't work like that. I just saw the heavy handedness of it, and it turned me off.As far as characters go, no one here was used well, and none of the characters had time to really do anything. I was so impressed by how so many characters were handled so well in Infinity War, but this was the complete opposite. Then characters were outright destroyed, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Iron Man, actually I will stop because I realized they actually ruined all that I can think of, except perhaps for Ant-man. Almost no one here was their character, every single one just about was the same, a cynical, cruel, angry, bad person. Just genuinely bad people, virtue less, nothing good. There was no heroism, none of the good qualities that make you like being around people. I didn't want to spend one minute more with these people.So to sum it up, this is a bad movie in execution and fundamental story telling. It also fails me personally because I go to a movie about heroes to see heroes, flawed, but with some shred of goodness that makes me like them. No one in this movie is likeable. Maybe Ant-man comes through unscathed."
1404,"I love Marvel Movies, I thought Infinity war was the best superhero movie ever and Thanos the best villain ever. I rated Infinity War with an absolute 10.But lets talk about this one. The expectations were very high of course, thanks to the first masterpiece.But this one has so many plot holes that it is ridiculous. I ll start with the movie itself first though.The pacing of the movie is slow and what I saw in the theaters does not justify 3 hours. They dragged it so muchThe fight scene happens in the end and there is no time to showcase each hero efficiently. Infinity was great because there was correct pacing and enough screen time for most heroesThey destroyed Thor's character. Thor is willing to sacrifice his life to avenge the deaths of his loved ones in Infinity War and he is so powerful with Stormbreaker that he nearly succeeds in killing Thanos. Yet when 2014 Thanos comes in, bearing no stones, Thor with BOTH Stormbreaker and Mjolnir is nothing for him. Man, how can you not consider this when making the movie?Hulk 100% sidelined once again. He is the original, strongest Avenger (or among the 2). Disappointing.Time traveling scenes are nothing more than references and fan service, no substanceCaptain marvel strong arms Thanos! Really? He might not be able to snap his fingers but he still has the power of the stones running through his body. He doesn't have to grab a stone with his left hand!Natasha's death was not dramatic. It was brushed off as humor! Terrible, just terrible.How anti-climatic to end the movie with a snap from Stark. I get it, contracts are over and stuff but that was weak for my tasteNow the many plot holes that sucked me out of the movie:The traveling back in time is an epiphany that they suddenly all inherently know the rules. Effortlessly. It doesn't feel earned. But lets forget that for a moment.The pim particle is used to timetravel 1 person. They were traveling in groups to the same timeline so, if it was possible to timetravel a whole gigantic ship with 1 particle like 2014 Nebula did, you would think that our heroes would use just 1 per group. Bu no. Our heroes use 1 per person. Thanos uses 1 for a freaking army.2014 Nebula can teleport that whole army with her hands doing that magic. So, 2019 Nebula could not? She is a better enhanced version of her 2014 self by definition!!!Nebula never tells them before hand that Thanos might be there BEFORE they go thereThe Soul Stone. Oh boy. Nebula knows what needs to be done to get it. She once again tells no one! Plus, the whole point is that you have to sacrifice your true love to get it! Not race with your friend on who gets to kill himself first! Clint didn't kill Natasha. He tried to save her. And she was not his true love, like Gamora was to Thanos.They do not want to create different timelines but they do. Thanos no longer exists in that past timeline as he gets killed prematurely, 5 years earlier. This means that he is not there to take those same actions as before, go after the stones, send people for the stones, do the snap. Nothing.Captain Marvel can fly in space. Yet, she takes the gauntlet and tries to fly through the battlefield! Just take it and fly away damn it! Fly over them!They send Captain America back with all the infinity stones, in a briefcase, all by himself!! Do you know how many villain can take a briefcase from Captain America????!!! IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSECaptain America goes back once for all stones. These were taken from different timelines. He should have traveled 4 distinct times, not 1. This in not 1 timeline from which all the stones are missing. These are 4 distinct timelines.Captain America doesn't use the pim particle to come back. It is implied that he ends up near the lake naturally, he stayed back, leaved his life and aged. So, this means that he ended up in this timeline, which can't happen! He is in a different timeline, in the past!!!!!! This definitely wont lead to the same events, nothing as we know it. He can't just jump between timelines without the particle so that he meets Hulk and the others here! Just think about it for a sec!In this timeline the snap has happened. In Captain's new timeline, there are 2 captain America's first of all! But we are not meddling with time lines and stuff.I have more but I think I made my point."
1405,"For a standalone movie, I give it a 7/10. Sadly, this is not a standalone movie because it just happens to follow up one of the best action movies ever - for that I give it a 3/10 to balance things out, so a total of 5/10.What I really don't get, even for people that only think of how to pocket more cash, is why they show such disrespect for their customers from whom they expect recurring revenues. I mean Marvel and in general franchise movies totally count on coming back viewers, so the previous movie literally pays the next.In Endgame's case they spent $400 million expecting to gross $2 (at least) billion, and they felt sorry for the few dollars more they would have spent to hire a decent writer to come up with a decent script - the single thing that pushed Infinity War to break away from the pack. That's a cheap attitude, which will eventually backfire.Where to start?The story is a disconnected, incoherent mess. Think of Infinity War script? Well think of the exact opposite for Endgame. There is absolutely no story connection whatsoever and it clearly shows in the way the actors perform on screen. The confidence everyone had in Infinity War simply is not here; it's like they don't really get what they are up to.The humor that flows naturally through to discharge the intense moments in Infinity War is tried to be copied here, only in a bad manner. I don't want to spoil things, but having Cap commenting on his butt, I mean, come on people..Time travel? Seriously? That was the best you could come up with to get over it? What a brilliant, original idea! Only a couple of hundred other movies and TV series have already thought of that, only to come up with a messy mindjob, regardless. Putting RDJ mumbling mumbo-jumbo quantum stuff to explain how time travel works (btw quantum mechanics has absolutely nothing to do with time in general), just left everybody in awe of what the heck he is talking about. Having watched the trailers, and the theories that crawled through the Internet, I was ready to go there and watch that, but somehow I was hoping otherwise - that was an absolute letdown, especially the way it was delivered.Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans managed to save some of it in their own way - nothing spectacular though. Others like Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo were totally crashed under the burden of the ridiculous script. As for the rest of the crew, well, ok, let's get paid and get outta here..Thanos, the more complex character of all, and the one that made Infinity War a success, appeared here just like all the other villains before him - think of Loki and Ultron and you get the idea of what Thanos has been reduced here to.All in all, Infinity War was truly hard to match and for that it made Endgame truly hard to watch. Infinity War, for its own reasons, set the bar really high. We have seen that coming in other sequels as well. What comes in mind as an example is The Matrix followed by Matrix Reloaded; the kind of standout movie that is plagued by its own successor.Infinity War followed by Endgame is not an exception. Many of us already knew that before walking into the theater. Sad to say though, Endgame eventually turned out as another example of what you get if you only do it for the money."
1406,"I want to begin by saying that had this been a standalone movie I would have probably given it a 4 or 5, but for this particular movie, the movie of the decade, the big conclusion everything was leading up to, mediocre-ness is worse than complete failure. We were promised a masterpiece and we received something that what so-so at best.
I'll break down what I think went wrong, so spoilers ahead:
The biggest issue with this movie is the ever-paradoxical use of time travel. Unless you are making a silly comedy like ""Back to the Future"" it always messes with continuity and no matter how well you try to explain that the canon reality does not just collapse under the paradox, it is always going to feel like the lazy way out, and so it did in this one. Steve deciding to go rogue back to the 40s, thus ignoring all the character development he went through and irreparably messing with every timeline is not exactly the extremely satisfying closure we were promised in interviews with directors and actors. Overall I suppose the expectations were just so high that nothing could have lived up to it, but with the amounts of money and the access to great creators Marvel has I really would have expected something else- something as creative and mind-blowing as they promised instead of the honestly mediocre at best time-travel flick we got. Messing with timelines and essentially de-canonizing large chunks of the MCU just was not what I was hoping for.
Another thing I had a problem with is that this movie was supposed to perfectly conclude every character's arc so far. We were promised a suitable ending of some journeys and at least a crucial point in everyone else's. Instead, Black Widow was killed without ever even allowing her to develop a character. Thor, who could have been the ideal king of Asgard was turned into a fatphobic joke by equating his chubbiness with sloppiness (personally, I liked his new look. Thor looked rather like a man who is strong from physical labour than planned workouts and diet plans, but the way they dressed him in dirty clothes, made him lazy and greasy is just so terrible), while the lessons he learned in Ragnarok and the sacrifices he made did not seem to have any effect at all; the loyalty he felt to his people completely disappeared. Iron Man was ripped of his peaceful retirement, where for the first time he was allowed to try to heal, just because someone had to die dramatically.
Don't misunderstand me, I am not bitter that they killed off beloved characters, in fact I understand that it had to happen, however I would have loved to see them take the characters' arcs into account. In my opinion, Steve should have died because he has no place in either the future or the past, and his mission is completed. Tony, on the other hand, should have lived because he finally made an effort to heal and overcome his trauma. I don't mean to suggest that one or another character should or should not have died, I only think I might have been able to accept the way things turned out if there was a reasonable plot leading up to it that made their death a logical conclusion. The Marvel movies are fictional and everyone who goes to watch them is very aware of the fact that there is a team of writers and creators who crafted everyone's arc and worked on it for a long time. I would have appreciated to watch the outcome reflect the amount of work and time I am sure many people put into this project.
Ultimately I have to admit that the messages we get to take away from this film are what really made me sad: People with trauma don't deserve to heal, people's actions and experiences have seemingly no consequences, and friendship and found family mean nothing against the ideal of a romantic relationship.This is a very long movie and so there are many more things I could address, for example the ""Hail Hydra"" scene, Steve wielding Mjolnir, how similar this movie was to the last one, Loki's unexplained disappearance in the past timeline, the cheap attempt of making up for the lack of lgbt heroes by showing a mlm extra in one scene, the list goes on. But all those things seem somehow related to the major issues I addressed earlier. Perhaps the hype was too big, perhaps the team did get lazy and rested on the success of the franchise or perhaps it is just me expecting too much from a superhero movie.
Regardless, if you loved this movie, I see your point, it is in many ways what we were expecting, but what I was hoping for was something new, something revolutionary that would surprise and amaze me. Maybe in another ten or twenty years we will get that movie I thought this was going to be, but I am afraid that by then I will not be interested anymore."
1407,"Try as did to like Endgame , the pace was poor, script nonsensical and apart from a few laughs, won't be going to watch it again like Infinity War. At times it was embarrassing to sit through it. Especially the ending. One to forget."
1408,"If you're a fan of the MCU, this movie most likely maxes out at about an 8/10. If you're a fan of superhero movies, this movie is not for you. Slow drama scenes fill the better part of a very long run time, leading to a 3 hour long superhero movie with only a handful of fight scenes and minimal action.Rather predictable for the most part. Very hit-or-miss: either a dream come true or quite mediocre. For the ""movie of the century"", it sure was a let down, that's for sure."
1409,"As a devoted Thor and Marvel fan I just have to say they ruined him for a bunch of jokes. They turned the king of Asgard into a fat fortnite player, immensly decreased his power level and renounced Asgard. I hate that I need to see this movie as cannon.They wasted Captain Marvel and made her real life attitude of a devoted feminist appear in the movie and that's a minus.Professor Hulk is absolutly hillarious but he wasn't really used except for some jokes and one quantum missionThat Captain America ending felt like an excuse for a finished contract.They streched out the movie a lotAnd now to the good thingsCGI was goodThank god for Doctor StrangeThe death of Tony was really sad and beautyful at the same time."
1410,"Praise the movie all they want this is a messy mesh mash of multiple time travel movies with superheroes .
Time travel is really messy.
The movie is not following the rules made forth by the movies before this. I.e If Captain Marvel power comes from the Tesseract and Thanos destroyed it or disable it then CM powers should be in logic cut off until reformed or enabled."
1411,"There was so many plot holes in this movie and was so far off what I expected it would be. And what's with this growing trend of killing off fan favorite characters? Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, and of the x-men from some unknown source that probably won't get explained until Dark Phoenix. 11 years of anticipation only to be hugely let down buy this movie. It seems to be a habit of Disney to take what is loved and ruin it. I'm tired of it and the bottom line is that Hollywood hasn't had an original thought in so long, they're only left with destroying all the things that we the fans love.Why didn't Dr. Strong use the stone to bring back Tony Stark just like he did with the apple in the first movie. He was able to manipulate time to one object (the apple) but couldn't do that to Tony without reversing Tony snapping his fingers? And what about Vision or Karen (Carter's niece that Captain America was involved with at some point. And what about Loki? He just disappears forever? There are many plot wholes left with a disappointing end to an 11 build up.Marvel, you failed. This is not a product worthy of creator who recently passed away."
1412,"I enjoyed Infinity War. Out of the 8 or so MCU Films, Infinity War was my 2nd favorite just behind Guardians of the Galaxy. I had issues with some of the editing, colors, and some bland moments. However, I thought Infinity War did a great job of writing a story that focuses on so many different plot lines each with its slew of characters. Although some groups were better than others, putting Thanos at the center of the film was a great idea. Watching all the plot lines converge was satisfying. The pacing was damn near perfect. Going into Infinity War, I had concerns. How were they going to have all of these characters involved in the story at once?
Infinity War addressed those concerns and put them to rest. Endgame, however, had all the concerns that I had with Infinity War even with less characters. For one, the pacing in this film is really rough. It's sort of all over the place. Having a time skip and time travel be such an integral part of the film was a good idea on paper, but the execution was weak. For starters, fighting Thanos over again, but the Thanos from Infinity War felt as if they were really stretching. It also feels like a less-evolved and less interesting Thanos. His goal just switches to erasing the universe and starting over which felt to betray his character a bit. Going back to old films was cute at first, but it lost its novelty really quick. I expect fan-service in these films, but the fan-service here overshadowed the whole film. Big moments, like Black Widow's death, didn't feel thought out. It also didn't have the emotion like the deaths from Infinity War did. The payoffs in this film really fell flat. Anticlimactic is a word I would use to describe this whole film. The huge battle at the end, again, appeared awesome on paper. But, the action was a little all over the place and hard to follow. It was also probably one of the stupidest things I've seen on screen, which is a good thing, trust me. Watching all these bizarre characters fight against these bizarre minions was fun to watch. It's just that the editing felt really rushed. I know this was the climax of the film, but it could have been slowed down a bit. There's also a lot that could have been cut from this film. There was a lot of moments where they tried to explain how this whole time-travel act makes sense, but it clearly doesn't. Their film's explanation was ""Eh, it makes sense. Here's why. Just, trust us."" There were a lot of these scenes and it felt unnecessary. This is a stupid comic book film, not everything has to be explained for me to enjoy the film. A story about men and women in suits fighting a giant purple boy doesn't have to be grounded. The suspension of disbelief is built into the film naturally, but the film spends way too much time trying to explain itself through spoken lines, and it really takes away from the film.
Lastly, I wasn't too invested in the characters. Iron Man's death and Captain America's ""retirement"" didn't feel too powerful to me. Granted, I'm not too connected to these characters. To be fair, I wasn't too connected to Gamora going into Infinity War, but her death had weight to it. They focused on really developing Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor throughout the film, but Thor's development was the only one that was somewhat enjoyable and believable. Captain America, especially, didn't appear to have any real growth and his ending was just...eh. The structure of this film was a mess compared to Infinity War which had an unconventional structure, but it worked mostly. This was just a mess. Also the colors in this film were, like most Marvel movies, excluding Galaxy of the Guardians, pretty bland. I just didn't really love this film. It wasn't awful, and I did enjoy it over something like Captain America: Civil War or Age of Ultron. Still, it was just alright."
1413,"Infinity wars felt much more balanced, and Thanos a much better villain. This one is very long, too epic for belief, the emotions less believable, and most of all, the storyline got too messy. Unfortunate as I loved Infinity wars and was looking for a great ending."
1414,"Agreed with the fact of overhype but the logic, the un necessary humor during time travel sequences, the almost no reason of captain marvel introduction before end game release, giving that shape to super smart Thor, .
..All these events tell you that at the end it's just the Russo's wish to do whatever they want...With out the mind applied to end game logic .....Why should I believe the Russo's.They are just ordinary film makers"
1415,"After what happened in Infinity war, the only question I had was ""how can they top that?"" That question was answered, no other superhero movie will be able to beat Endgame. The movie just gets better and better and the huge finale is done spectacularly and has everything you want to see and much, much more. The set up for this was perfect, the build up to this was perfect, and the pay off was perfect. Avengers: Endgame is done flawlessly and perfectly."
1416,Worst film in MCU so far! Totally missed the expectations after Avengers:Infinity War was so great.
1417,"Oh boy, let´s go, then: Avengers: Endgame was one of the movie I was REALLY anxious to see. After IW, the bar was really high. So, I though the bar would be as high or even higher. Unfortunately I was wrong. I´ll make my opinion this way:POSITIVES:Acting was superb, in general, but RDJ's was top.CGISoundtrack
NEGATIVES:First one and simply put...this is not an action movie, it´s a drama with some scenes of action. When you go to an action movie you don´t hear many people crying during the movie, do you?Pace too slow. The first 2 hours are quite boring. Then you get some 20 minutes of good action;So, the villain that was unbeatable in the first movie is killed in the first minutes of the movie? Right...Time travel usually gives some headaches after. That are several in this movie, like future Nebula killing the past Nebula and still, being able to exist all the same;The way they treated Hulk again was a joke. In the last movie it was offensive. In this, you have a nice smart Hulk, that barely fights;The way they treated Thor. Now his beard is massive, he doesn´t take bath and mostly, he´s a fat drunk;Too much time was spent on Haweye. Who cares about him?Remember how hard was to beat Thanos with IG? Forget it, know Thor, Cap (with Thor´s Mjolnir) and Iron Man can´t beat him, even with Thanos not having the IG. In fact, not even the OP Captain Marvel can do it. The only one was SW;Captain Marvel, every time she appears, shows how much powerful she is. But, forget it, she´s out about 97% of the movie;The gathering of the team was forced and lame;Quill has little time. Just some few minutes;Dr. Strange and SW have even less time;Cap. and Stark interaction was short, as usual;Pepper now is kind of a Iron Woman. She appears in the final battle...! What???;Hulk could handle the IG, but they had to put Iron Man due it in order to kill him. Sorry, that´s too much for me.Such a massive of opportunity they had here. They could even given us a better movie than IW..."
1418,"Too many cringe worthy moments.
Too much talking not enough action.
This is superhero movie, not looking for bloodly oscar performance.
Time travel thing was silly nonsense. I felt like walking out."
1419,"I still cannot believe, that they screwed this part that much!
Thor fights so many movies to become a strong hero.. and then they simply destroy him in one movie. It wasnt even funny. Playing Fortnite... really now ?
Also with Hulk... Very bad decision here. a joke on my eyes. He felt so useless the whole movie and the explanation about his new look, was.. one sentence ?But there is so much more bad on this movie. Captain America just gets the ability to use Thor´Hammer. Without an explanation.
Captain Marvel is the whole movie not there. Sure! There is a very big chance that the Avenger will fight vs the guy that killed 1/2 people of the univers, but she has much more important things to do. Sure !Infinity Wars was much better on my opinion. Endgame is just embarrassing bad...."
1420,"Avengers Endgame is the epic conclusion to infinity saga and the final chapter to a 22 movie franchise. We of course have to give credit to the Russo Brothers for directed not only this movie but also Avengers Infinity War (2018) , Captain America the Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America Civil War (2016). After the snap by the Mad Titan Thanos who is perfectly played by Josh Brolin and the Avengers must restore the damage and defeat Thanos once and for all. This movie also wrapped up some character arcs like Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr). But with all of these Pros there are Cons. One of them is how they handled the character Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) who has no personality no character arc or development. All we know about her is that she is overpowered and gives a little smirk when she give a clever remark. I get it they just introduced her but come on at least give her some more screen, she was in the first ten minutes and then doesn't show up until the last 20 minutes to beat the crap out of thanos and his army. Another issue is how they handled Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Like I understand that Thor is depressed and blames himself for the snap but seriously that doesn't mean he becomes an alcoholic, lazy,fat guy who plays Fortnite. It ruins how they portrayed Thor in Thor Ragnarok (2017) and in Infinity War (2018). One good good thing about Endgame is the fan service in the movie such as all the references to the other MCU movies such as the first Avengers (2012), Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the galaxy (2014), Thor the Dark World (2013), Avengers Infinity War (2018), Captain America the first Avengers (2011) and Captain America the Winter Soldier (2014). I also enjoyed how they gave the underdeveloped character such as Nebula, War Machine and Hawkeye, especially Nebula who develops a friendship with War Machine and we feel for her as she used to be a minor character but now played a important role and has the spotlight in some scenes. We now we finally get to best scene in not only this movie but also the entire MCU. The final battle with all the heroes vs Thanos army where everyone has their moment to shine like when Scarlet Witch fight Thanos and breaks his sword, when spiderman activate instant kill, when Iron man and Pepper Fight together and of course when Captain America finally wields Mjolnir and absolutely beats thanos down and all of this leads to the saddest scene in all of the MCU, Iron Man's death scene which made even the toughest of men cry. This movie is will go down as the best movie of the decade and any more years to come."
1421,"The fact that this movies exists is insulting.
Paradox to the max.
They ignore every warning and go out of their way to screw everything up.
They ignore their own time travel rules.
They break EVERY version of EVERY timeline multiple times, by the end of it there was no reason to take the stones back because no version of what they remember would have happened. If they did take them all back loki still got away so last few movies didn't even happen.
How is it that when they go back the past becomes their future when at every turn they are all surprised and don't remember or realize its already happened while creating an ad-nauseam of new timelines.
In fact they create so many new timelines and paradoxes that a rift in space should have swallowed the earth's of all timeless into nothingness.
Hero's?
So where has captain marvel been throughout all of the old movies?
It took all of the guardians to wield one stone, but iron man can wield all 6 with his magical nanotech? so spiderman, ANYONE from wakanda, war machine, his wife, captain marvel, could have used it.
Used the stones, so sorcerer supreme removed the stone why and the hulk can just hold the time stone no problem?
Wait hold up, iron man can make a kings weapon out of nanotech now? so wakanda could too right...
Captain can now use thors hammer AND stormbreaker, after hes been cursing and whining the whole movie."
1422,"Not what it was pumped up to be. Captain Marvel, useless. Thor, broken. Stark, hitting well above his weight. Captain America annoying as ever. Ant-Man, completely left out of the loop. Hulk, not incredible at all."
1423,"A messed up past, present, and future time continuum. If Thanos was not able to click his finger to make 50% of the people disappear since he did not get the stones in the first place, then why there's a need for another click from Hulk?Thanos, who travels around the universe, doesn't know how to build a time machine but iron man can?At least my kids love movie, I'm happy already."
1424,Overabundant. Excessive. Confused. Too long. Flat. Even boring.
1425,"It's long, and I don't mean in time length, but plot. It FEELS loooooong. The LOTR trilogy flew by. This...did not. And I'd love to know why Cpt. Marvel was in there at all. The climax is amazing. It is truly the climax of climaxes, but that's not surprising. Any superhero movie with its salt, is going to have a badass battle against good and evil."
1426,"The starting scene with Hawk Eye was absolutely great, we were all wondering about questions how would post apocalyptic universe of Marvel looks like, what happened after the slick? We got those answer by a stunning, realistic, dramatic starting scene.However, devolopment phase of the movie is a SCANDAL. Too many boring staff going on, trying to find a solution for the making the world nice again (I should say that post apocalyptic scenes are really illogical, people still sorrow after 5 years later and there is nothing going on the world except japan mafia. LOL) and they come up with a idea of TIME MACHINE.Top level of creativity showed itself around here. Thanks to script writers nice job!Two geniuses, Mark Ruffalo and Robert D. Jr. figures out quickly principles of time travel and team gathers up together for the ENDGAME. Wow.Conclusion phase of the movie was a disaster as well. Not gonna get into too much detail but everything should be ended differently if you consider all knowledge we gathered from Doctor Strange and Thanos.Captain Marvel wouldn't showed up in the Infinity Wars Thanos Fight last time because she was busy with ""Universe Problems"" while half of all living being destroyed, Thanks for the OP character to getting involved to that case in the second time, and all is well again. Movie finishes just like my review finishes.People are not evaluating the movie, they are just here to applause everything that were made from Marvel. They think this movie is the last Avengers movie. Thanks to those DUMBS (Sorry for my real opinion) economics of the Avengers movies will always be profitable."
1427,"As the film starts, we still have the events of Infinity War in mind, all the loss and confusion, and the beautiful final scene : Thanos in his farm, and his face split between the satisfaction of a mission accomplished and the sorrow of what it cost him (""everything""). It was really an exciting finish, but all for none.Everything they did well in Infinity War was thrown to the garbage can in Endgame : in the first hour only they managed to destroy all the emotional implication of the viewers by throwing all the jokes they could think of to our faces. Want to see a fat Thor play Fortnite ? Here you go. What about Hulk taking selfies and making dabs ? We got you pal. Shameful, to the point that when they finally decide to gather the remaining Avengers and try to reverse the course of things (by going back to the past), you already don't care anymore.They sucked all the epicness of the previous film to serve you this final product, a massive fan-service film of 3 hours, where each hero has their ""heroic"" moment just to remind the viewers they're still here (at least physically, most are of no use in the story). We got it, your contracts are done with Marvel, no need to stretch it for that long.And what about Thanos, the biggest accomplishment of the last film ? What they did to him is also a disgrace : all the beauty of the character that was imposed to us, the viewers, as the villain of the story was coming from the ambiguity of where he stands, and the fact that lots of us could believed in what he was willing to sacrifice to reach his final goal. He taught us how to feel and care for an antagonist like never before in a Marvel movie. But here, his personality is suddenly turned into the one of a heartless monster, ready to slaughter the entire universe just to create a new one to his image (which was not his goal in Infinity War). What is the point of the last film and all its well-done build-up if it's to impose us now that the Avengers are the only ones to be right and that automatically Thanos is wrong ? What makes them believe their opinion must be everyone else's opinion and if we disagree with them we must die ?The film has some nice moments (some beautiful shots), but they sacrificed all the logic and integrity of Infinity War to serve us with easy, poor nostalgia and sentiments. Was Infinity War an anomaly in the Marvel universe ? And Endgame made to finally correct the course of the story, toward a more conservative ending, celebrating its heroes and the actors that play them more than its potential wisdom ?"
1428,"It was very slow at many parts of the movie, many of them unnecessary and there were many things that was left unexplained. I felt they the movie was directed to the new marvel fans and didn't give us marvel veterans the fan service we wanted. It was a rather good comedy, but the action that I was expecting was lacking. The was put out to be appealing towards society and media, and not to us fans of the series.I feel betrayed, but understand why it ended up like this. I get why people would enjoy it, but I didn't. This is the avengers, and therefore it is definitely a must-see, just not as great as it was expected.."
1429,I dont know why but this move very dull for me.Many gaps. So much potential but they dont use itIm really MCU fans but this just soo far below my expectation.4 stars for the saga not the movie
1430,"***Warning...possible spoilers***
This movie was fine, but it was not great. It did a somewhat satisfactory job of bringing together all of the previous MCU movies...certainly no easy task. However, there was very little action, most of the jokes fell flat, and the emotional scenes didn't reverberate. Also, there were just too many obvious plot holes, both within the whole time-travel theme and in general. It just wasn't a great story or a great job of storytelling. I'll admit that I'm not an emotional person, but anyone who said they cried (especially some of the critics who said they cried, cried, laughed, cried, cheered, and cried some more) has never seen an actual well-made movie with a great story. I didn't cry at the end of Infinity War, and I certainly didn't get even the slightest bit emotional in Endgame. I also saw critics who said everyone stood and cheered when it was over. I definitely didn't experience that. Our theater just sat pretty quietly with quite a few conversations about the gaping plot holes. Again, not a bad movie, but it certainly didn't live up to what I was hoping for."
1431,"I've loved every Marvel movie multiple times over, and by far, my biggest complaint with this movie is that Endgame doesn't follow one main Arc, with my favorite Superhero, happiness.
Ever since the events of Avengers, Tony has wanted happiness and to be done with the whole Superhero gig. Tony does get this in Endgame, but it's taken away from him by Steve Rogers showing up proposing a plan to defeat Thanos.
My whole problem is that my favorite Superhero found happiness only to have it ripped from him.Awful movie towards the end.
I didn't cry at my grandfathers funeral, but when Tony died I had to hold back tears."
1432,"They got so many things right... then turned around and got so many things wrong.If I had to guess there were many disagreements about how to go about this movie and it shows both in the writing, but also the pacing.Im sure this movie will go down in the record books both in money made and ratings, but there are so many movies in the MCU that are better written and better executed.Ill watch it again once it comes out on dvd and see if a second viewing changes my opinion."
1433,"Badly made. First hour felt like thrown together in few minutes. Some jokes just went out too far, I was really hoping them to go away towards the end... But no. Many characters simply ruined forever, which makes no sense. I did not enjoy the movie
Most of the people will say this is good because of the Fan hype. I'm a Marvel fan all the way, but this just wasn't it."
1434,"After seeing Infinity War i was so excited to see this movie. I must say i was rather disappointed. This movie was not awful, there are some really good scenes but there were so many things that annoyed me.
Thor - he was literally turned into a joke. Ruined his entire character and back story,.
Hulk - did he actually do anything? No! absolutely ruined his character. After being useless in the last movie i honestly thought he would redeem himself in this one. It does not happen.
Captain Marvel - Why create such a powerful character then miss her out of 90% of the movie? When she does finally appear i was expecting an epic fight scene between her and Thanos...... no! nothing. They literally have a little scuffle and that's the end of it. Then you don't see her again until the very end of the movie.
The time travel story made no sense - i can't even begin to type about that.you'll see if/when you watch. I will just say this - The Thanos the Avengers were fighting was based before all of the Avengers movies - which means after killing him, the first movies would never have happened. thats just one.
The first half of the movie was a little slow paced, i was thinking ""is something going to happen"". The end battle was good but it was WAY too short and there was so much going on that I couldn't concentrate on one thing. Plus i do not understand how Thanos was so powerful without the infinity stones.
The weapon Thor created in Infinity war was capable of killing Thanos but, for some reason Thor couldn't defeat him with not one, but 2 weapons. Speaking of weapons, I hated the fact that Captain America was able/worthy of wielding Thor's hammer - NO! its Thor's weapon. I felt like it took power away from the characters.
Like i said - not awful, but nowhere near as good as Infinity War (which i would rate a 9). I rated this movie a 6 because that's an average rating, and i think this movie is average."
1435,"Well, the magnificent saga ends with a such great and satisfying conclusion which gives you the best cinematic experience of your life. Unexpected, brilliant and an all together masterpiece."
1436,"Infinity War was amazing movie but after what they did in it and how they ended it, it was obvious for me that it was gonna be hard to come back in Endgame. Endgame plot unfolded just as I expected it would. They used jail free card with time travel to save everyone where they don't have to explain a single thing. It was happy and almost perfect ending, disregarding Tony's and Black Widow's death but considering that Tony did everything he wanted (saved Parker and his family), it wasn't such bad ending even for him. In Infinity War, Thanos was not just classic villain who wants to destroy the world. Instead he had a point and his cause. In Endgame his motives changed pretty quickly. Now he is just as generic villain as Steppenwolf from Justice League who wants to end the world. Yeah sure, he wants to create new and better world after where he will be God but we couldn't know what would happen later since everyone would be dead. Thanos was ridiculously strong without Gauntlet and stones. Thor was joke and pretty much useless since now we got 'new God of Thunder' Captain America who is suddenly worthy and knows how to cast Thunder Strikes and stuff. I mean Thor (who is God of Thunder by the way) needed like 3 movies to master his thunder abilities but Cap (who is human on steroids and not God of Thunder) did it in 15 seconds. In Infinity War, the gauntlet that could contain the power of all stones could be forged only from heart of the dying star and now everyone has one. Scarlet Witch is low-key alone stronger than Thanos. Comedy was on point. There was perfect amount of it. Thor trash talking the kid over the phone because of Fortnite was pretty funny. Hulk-Banner jokes were great. CGI was amazing as always. I probably forgot to mention something but overall, maybe I was just hyped too much and I expected too much from the movie so it just disappointed me with it's medium quality."
1437,"Blockbuster movies are made to entertain people and we mustn't expect logic, I fully agree with that. I had great fun watching MI: Fallout and Alita Battle Angel this year but Endgame turns out to be like every other superhero movie that came out this decade. The opening scene features Jeremy Renner losing his family after Thanos' actions in the last film, after that scene to till the end the movie just bombards us with video game like action sequences and unfunny jokes.The plot of the movie is much better most superhero films to its credit but the dialogue and screenplay was no different. While I don't want to spoil the plot, this film has bought back all characters associated with the MCU and is a reunion delight for many hardcore fans. The final battle sequence is my least favorite part of the film, it features random action sequences and right from the very start you would know how its gonna end. If you are expecting it to be like the ones you saw in The Lord of The Rings or Harry potter you are gonna end up disappointed.If this is Robert Downey Jr.'s last film as Iron Man as per reports its a great news for all movie buffs, a talented actor like him has wasted his last 5 years acting only in MCU franchise movies which didn't fully utilize his potential. Finally, this movie is going to be the biggest blockbuster of the year without any doubt but its only the beginning of end of the superhero genre."
1438,"This movie is average. Worth a seeing, but that's it!!So many things are wrong, I don't even know were to starttimeline concept is really stupidTo much Hawkeye and totally o.pHulk has become a sissy, and won't really fightThor has become a fat drunk, but a fun comedian.Hawkeye can wield an infinity stone with his bare hands...wtf??!This is more a slapstick comedy, with drunk jokes, Fortnite jokes and other stupid jokes, than it is an epic conclusion to the Avengers / MCU, and with only around 20 min of action in total, the movie is wayyyyyy to long.End battle was so stupid, that many in the theater began to laugh and 'buuhhhh'. Was that really it? Was that what we've been waiting so long for?!
Dr Strange was just standing around doing nothing else than play with water.
Hulk didn't get to fight Thanos. Would have been awesome endbattle, so he could get revenge from Infinity Wars!
Several other things was stupid too, but I've almost already forgot the movie.Seems like the producers ran out of ideas, how to het the stones back from Thanos, so in the end, even though he hasn't fully working armor, Tony Stark just sissy-slap Thanos, and then suddenly he has the stones?!So many powerful charaters, and it could have been an epic battle..but then it end like this!!I was disapointed, but still...it's a Marvel movie, so it deserve a 7/10 😀"
1439,Super cheesy... hulk struggles to control the infinity gauntlet but iron man with no enhanced powers is able to do so... captian marvel is way more powerful than thanos even with the infinity stones... thor and captain America could not defeat thanos with no stones... this movie was only made to please the audience not to introduce a developed plot... side note... also watching the movie opening weekend will be a mistake because the audience will cheer for no reason.
1440,"I was expecting something much better. The movie is way too long, it has a lot of unnecessary scenes. Some parts were actually boring. Captain Marvel is really annoying."
1441,"Here is my spoiler free review, I often like to discuss the negatives of a movie before the positives so here goes.I didn't quite enjoy Endgame as much the first time around since I had been spoiled about significant events in the film and it does suffer from quite a few plot holes. Some events aren't explained quite enough and require a good bit of mental gymnastics to hurdle. My main complaint like many others, despite not having much screen time, is Brie Larson (more on that later). Captain Marvel's movie, of which I do share the popular dislike for, was released barely over a month before Endgame. This is important because she is quite arrogant and emotionless in Endgame, a popular argument being Tony Stark is quite arrogant also, however we have had over a decade and 10 movies to watch and understand Stark's backstory and why he is this way, Captain Marvel not so much. I do however give Brie Larson the benefit of the doubt, after seeing how she is in interviews and such, I do believe the blame here lies with the directors. Larson and Marvel seem like completely different people. Her appearance is downgraded later in the movie too. There's also a scene with Fortnite.. which of course speaks for itself.All of the above is why I simply cannot give it a 10, one may think how can so many negatives only deduct 1 from a perfect score? Well, staying true to a spoiler free review that is quite the task to explain of course.As with any avid fan like myself and having watched Iron Man in cinemas 11 years ago, here we are 22 movies later and there isn't much more I could've asked for. Lot's of previous questions answered, closure brought to many story-lines, many epic moments and surprises. Had the franchise not been so long until this point, my rating most likely would've been 7.5. Somebody that has watched all previous instalments will appreciate Endgames nods at it's predecessors, lots of rewards for longtime fans. Is it as good as Infinity War? Not quite, it does shortly follow however, up there with my favourites IW, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man. A must watch for any Marvel fan. There are however still unanswered questions as with any MCU movie, which will most likely be answered in the upcoming titles.TLDR: Slightly political, plot holes and an undesirable character that ultimately get's trumped by the excellence of the other 95%"
1442,"Great closure, amazing movie. Just the right ending for a 22 movie saga."
1443,"Though it has been repeated time and time again, it is still quite insane to think about an end to 11 years and 22 movies. A cinematic universe that for quite a few of us, we have grown up with. A universe that despite all the bad that may have gone on in one's life or in the world, we could always look forward to one day out of the year where we could escape that and enjoy 2 hours of watching our childhood heroes kick butt on the silver screen. A cinematic universe, that I quite frankly thought was impossible to successfully conclude, until the Russo Brothers proved me wrong.
Any way you slice it, Avengers Endgame should go down as one of the toughest movies to write. Bringing a true and satisfying ending to 11 years of stories in a universe where the death is never truly accepted, the cast size seems never-ending, and an overabundance of story arcs could drive any writer insane should prove a near impossible task. Yet here we are as smart, conscious decisions are made throughout the movie. The reduced team size allows for a focus both character and story wise that makes it a movie easy to follow (for the most part) despite still being among the most ambitious Marvel movies. Surprise callbacks and fan-service moments act like a Greatest Hits album giving fans a true appreciation for the greatness of the Infinity Saga. Despite the temptation to just rely on these callbacks, where the film truly shines like any other Marvel movie is with its characters. Through the course of the 4,5, and 6 movies the Original Six Avengers have appeared in, several decisions have been made that not only affected each character but changed their overall perspectives. The Russo Brothers dedication to these characters is seen in the masterfully crafted scenes that continue or conclude the appropriate arcs. All while still producing shots, scenes, and moments that created the best cinematic experience I have ever had. To put it simply, for 3 hours I simply got to be a 10-year-old cheering, laughing, and crying with the heroes that I have grown up with, idolized, and loved for my whole life. For that I thank the entire Marvel family!"
1444,"It worth the hype, the movie was simply amazing and it had a strong emotional impact, I was diving from laughing to tension and sadness, but after all it was a great movie! All the 1 star reviews are wired in my opinion, those people just throw away with hate without even watching the whole MCU or just because they didn t understand the hype."
1445,"This superhero epic is totally worth watching ten or more times.What I can say about this movie is... It really blew me, my friends and everyone else who saw this movie away as it delivered what we as Marvel fans expected from the release date premiere. A holy grail of awesomeness.The fight between every MCU character possible and 2014 Thanos' army of bad guys was the most exciting part of this movie and when Cap said ""Avengers Assemble"" we all cheered and gone crazy like savage apes in the wildlife as what we just witnessed is the greatest fight scene in all of cinematic history.The deaths of both Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) and Tony Stark (Iron Man) were real heart-breaking to even look at and they almost made me cry with melancholy inside of me.I was expecting a post or mid-credits scene during the credit roll of this movie as it ended. But in surprise, it turned out there was no post or mid-credits scene as it is the first MCU movie not to have any.Great acting from Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and Jeremy Renner, etc. Astonishing visual effects, cinematography, musical score from Alan Silvestri, amazing direction from the Russo brothers and an overall excellent script from Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely.10/10"
1446,"As someone who spent almost every waking moment leading up to this movie theorizing, rewatching past movies, and talking with others about anything Marvel. I was satisfied. I found every character arc to be fulfilled except possibly Widow, but with a solo movie to come I hope that will be wrapped up nicely. Overall, this movie moved me and brought me an immense amount of closure. Look forward to the future"
1447,For me Endgame was emotional saga and the journey of our generation came to and end and yes it was not action packed as Infinity War but I feel every violence comes to and end with piece and the ENDGAME could not have better journey then to have established the storyline the way they did.
1448,"How in the hell did Marvel Studios pull this off. A epic conclusion to 11 years of films and the epic follow up to Infinity War. Some how the 3 hours long movie does not get boring at any point. I love seeing the world after the snap and the time heist is fun look back to other MCU movies. Plus the final hour of the movie is what I am just going to say has the best movie scene of all time. The most epic battle from Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man vs Thanos and all Avengers characters against Thanos and his forces. Love it!!!!!!!!!"
1449,"What a monumental movie & wonderful closure for a 11yrs Odyssey that is gonna be remembered as a legendary achievement on a cinematic standpoint. It is a magnificent love letter to all these emblematic characters & for us all, passionate fans of these universes."
1450,"This movie is a complete masterpiece! It is excellently acted, directed, and animated. It is an amazing payoff of all the previous marvel movies coming together."
1451,"Endgame does have a few minor plot holes, but overall, it is an incredible culmination of the MCU. I was terribly afraid they were going to easily reset all of the damage done in Infinity War, but that was not the case here. This film revisited many of the past installments via the time traveling aspect. I thought this was going to be terrible but they honestly did it very well. The whole MCU is tied together quite well. We are also treated with some meaningful and sacrificial character deaths that will likely be permanent. The final battle is a true masterpiece and honestly made me tear up a little bit (I am not one to cry). When Cap lifts and wields Mjolnir, I wanted to stand up and cheer. Truly an incredible scene. We also finally get to see Thanos full combat ability without the boost of the Infinity Gauntlet which is a nice treat.
Now, there are a couple issues here. First of all, Captain Marvel is off doing who knows what while the rest of the Avengers are fighting for the survival of the universe. What could she possibly be doing that is more important? She finally shows up at the end out of nowhere, similar to her entire existence in this universe. Honestly, they should've saved her for the next phase. She is too powerful a character to throw in at the end of all this with minimal development.I also disliked how the heroes' base is utterly annihilated by Thanos' ship with all of them in it. I understand those like Thor, Cap, Hulk, and Iron Man surviving, but Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Rocket are totally unharmed? A little unrealistic even in this universe.All that said, I absolutely loved this film and really couldn't be happier with this conclusion. Yes, they could've worked out a couple bumps in the plot, but hey, no movie is perfect."
1452,This is a amazing movie which is easy to track the story point and the charters the only fault i can give is the story line its has can get quite confusing other then that amazing story non the less and a good sequence of fight scenes and other emotional scene.
1453,"Endgame is an epic adventure , emotional roller-coaster with full of plot twists and conclusion to all that 11 years of storytelling. while watching #endgame I was laughing so loud, clapping so hard and got emotional in the end.
What an experience!
Sooo Goood."
1454,I have seen this couple of time but still I can watch over and over again.
1455,"It was Great ending but also emotional.
When I remember the first avengers film and now the ending of the avengers, I was very emotional
Especially, when Two Avengers die (Iron Man and Black Widow).
At the ending of the film, It was like 3rd world war.I LOVE YOU 3000"
1456,"Much like I did for Infinity War, I was caught up a little bit on the hype, but mostly I think I prioritized seeing this so that I could browse Reddit again, since so many popular posts are memes from the final two Avengers films. Unsurprisingly perhaps, I found that it was very much the overall picture I found with Infinity War, which is that it is far from perfect, a blockbuster pure and simple, but that it is quite a piece of work in terms of how well put together it all is.In terms of that structure, at time of writing this there are quite a few comments comparing it to the final season of Game of Thrones (which right now just has 2 episodes left) in the way that it has to bring everything together. The comparison is unfavorable, partly because GoT continues it very rushed approach to writing, but mainly because Endgame does it very well. The detail of the plotting is of course filled with holes that are best just to ignore, but the structure allows for a very nice conclusion as we retouch on moments from within the existing films, allowing nostalgia, references, and a sense of winding it up (although of course it will continue as long as the films make money). As with Infinity War, the writing somehow gives characters enough time despite there being so many of them; it hits several tones but none undercuts or takes away from another; and it mixes humor and action into a plot that takes itself seriously enough so it feels like it has weight.Of course it is still a blockbuster film, and far from perfect, but it is impressively done and very easy to enjoy if you go with what it is doing."
1457,"Let's get this straight from the start: Infinity War is far more entertaining and a better film overall.Endgame is a nice way to send off the storyline with a fan service movie, giving some nice nostalgia for the previous Marvel films in the series and the characters we've come to know and love, but there are many problems with the overall plot and film itself.It would take quite a while to go in to it in too much detail, but to put it simply: Infinity War was also a long movie, but never felt long. I check my watch after what turned out to be 1 hour of Endgame and couldn't believe there was still another 2 hours to go.It's possible I'd hyped it up to myself too much beforehand, but even then, plot points would have annoyed me regardless. I'd say the overall feelings afterwards were: nostalgic, sad (I admit to some tears), happy, ""it was alright""... but ultimately a little disappointing and frustrating."
1458,"Is the film underwhelming? Yes. It is still good? Yes. With all of the hype i saw on social media and my friend's conversations I had extremely great high hopes for this film however I was left slightly dissatisfied.At 3 hours, the film is way too long and it can drag sometimes, especially in the tedious build up of the first half of the film.Whilst the second half of the film is quicker paced and more enjoyable, including a very well choreographed, action packed end fight scene, I had felt i has seen it all before when thinking about the fight scene in Wakanda in Infinity War and so this wasn't anything special to me. The only thing I did really enjoy about this scene was the return of the fallen soldiers through Dr. Strange's portals. For me, this was one of the best sequences of the entire film.Similarly, the payoff for the culmination of the fight scene- the Avengers defeating Thanos- was anticlimactic. The writers of the film were not going
to have the Avengers lose their final outing and so I fully expected this to happen. Contrast this with last year's infinity war, where I was left utterly shocked at the fact the Avengers, who had been built up as an unstoppable force over the previous 2 films, had lost. My jaw was at the floor in the cinema at the time. It was this complete unexpectedness of the climax of Infinity War that makes me believe, however unpopular this may be, that Infinity War was better than Endgame.This film is still however very good. The cast are, as always, great in their roles and the production value is fantastic, which makes for some beautiful looking scenes. All of the jokes (bar Korg playing Fortnite and Hulk dabbing) land, as does equally the action sequences. The addition of new characters in the Avengers series, such as Captain Marvel, are a welcomed addition and inject some fresh blood into the already solid cast, even with their minute amount of screen time (seriously, Captain Marvel had more haircuts than minutes on screen).The plot is solid, although the time travel aspect is confusing at times. Similarly, the plot does open some gaping plot holes. Why are the Guardians of the Galaxy searching for Gamora when they ran into her in the fight scene? (I will admit I'm not a hardcore Marvel fan and so maybe missing something) and how can Captain America suddenly pick up Thor's hammer? (I definitely AM missing something there). Thirdly, there are continuity errors. Thanos tears Iron Man, Captain America and Thor and their respective weaponry apart all at the same time WITHOUT the gauntlet. Thanos is strong, but not that strong.The ending however was the perfect culmination of 22 films over the last 11 years. It tied everything together nicely and gave almost every character a satisfying ending, especially Captain America. Even the end credits with each actors signature were damn beautiful. It didn't bring me to tears but it did make me feel emotional.The Avengers films have been some of my favourite films over the last few years and so to see it end is saddening. This film could have been much better but I am not disappointed with the way the ended it. It really is the end of an era."
1459,"First things first - I would call myself a moderate Marvel fan. I have watched most of the movies and know enough about the plot and general lore to be able to watch the movies without going ""who the hell is this"" every minute.Having said that I think that the movie was average. Not bad. Not good. Just a film you watch and then forget about two days later. When I watched Infinity War in cinema I was pretty impressed - I wasn't dying over it, but for a superhero movie it introduced a lot of new ideas to the table.Endgame on the other hand just feels like a chinese takeover from two days ago you stumble upon in your fridge. Most of the plot is just boring. There is little to no tension, the action jumps all over the place, the actions of the heroes often make no sense at all. I am not a fan of time travel because it takes a lot of skill and precision to write a story that isn't chaotic. And Endgame didn't manage to convey a good time travel story - which is like what the whole movie is about basically.All in all I think Endgame might have been released a bit to early. They should have put some more time, thought and effort into it, especially when this movie was supposed to be the grand, spectacular finale of such a huge scale saga. A bit dissapointing."
1460,"Fanboys are ruining the movie industry. 9,1? Really? This movie is far from the best movie of all times. It's insane and sad. Disney is cancer."
1461,"Overall the movie wasn't bad. Some of the hulk cgi was ordinary coupled with unusual gravity on other cgi fight scenes. In other words some of the fight scenes lacked proper rag doll graphics.The start was so miserably slow.Some of the heroism was so ott usa crap full of genuine brings moments. Totally unbelievable character portrayal taking on roles far beyond their capabilities.Captain Marvel disappointed me. Considering the success of her own franchise film she played a very small role only to get smashed and never returned. Considering she was the most powerful avenger I was expecting way more.Tony Starks death along with high kick girls death, were in my view great scenes. Pulled at the heart strings and for once they didn't employ the sappy use of cringy red white and blue dual pistols firing into the sky macho crap.Overall it was just worth 3 hours of my time, but not a movie I would see again. From all the hype I expected way more."
1462,"I liked ''Infinity war'' very much . In fact , it was a motivation for me to see the other superhero movies in order to understand the entire plot of the series .
'' End Game ''is a total disaster . I was sitting in my chair waiting two hours for the movie to actually begin . While ''Infinity war '' was an almost non stop combat with mind blowing CGIs , ''Endgame'' is far from it . I am just wondering what's in the mind of those who gave between 7 - 10 stars .There are two posibilities : the lack of critical rationality or , perhaps, they are first class fans who swallow everything Marvel releases . I was being indulgent by offering 3 stars . And I think many of you will share my point of view ."
1463,"Not a full review cause I don't feel like doing one.Endgame was fine. It's riddled with far too many plot holes, cringy humor and weird character choices for me to give it anything over a 5. Hulk and Thor are completely butchered here as characters imo. The 2nd act is boring and does every time travel cliché you could think of, third act however, although blatant fan service is fun and exciting to watch. 3rd act basically saves the movie. The main reason I saw this was to see how Captain America's arc ends since he is one of the few characters I care about in the mcu. Unfortunately Iron Man's arc is done way better here compared to Cap's. No spoilers but Captain America's ending is shoehorned in at the last second and makes no sense. It felt completely unnatural . Oh yeah and hulk dabs, in the year 2023."
1464,"Don't know what all the hype was about! The film is one hour too long because there just wasn't enough action. The Hulk was not so ""Incredible"" & Thor was not much of a ""God"" I was rather perplexed by how underutilised some of the characters were given the powers they have. The ending had potential, but unfortunately it failed to deliver. It's good but not great."
1465,"Enjoyable movie that takes to long to get into the action and doesn't make any sense once you step back and think about what they've done. Even their explanations on what they were going to do, what they did do, and the final outcomes make no sense. I believe the world would be an even bigger mess when they were done, and Steve broke all the rules!"
1466,"One word deus ex machinaCaptain Marvel saves the day randomly 2-3 times ?Thor is fat
Hulk gets powned
Iron man gets a child then is powned
And Captain America grows old...Save your money, watch it on DVD or streamingsad..."
1467,"The movie drags on at points and the beginning and goes into some tropes that create problems.Feels like a clear step back in character writing for the villains, excellent final act and epilogue.Infinity war is ultimately the superior movie."
1468,"I went to go watch this movie on 04/27 and wanted to think on it before I decided to leave a review. I've never done a review, but I had to for this movie. This review will contain some spoilers.Pro's:The opening scene was great in my opinion. We pick up from where we left off, the survivors feel guilty for what happened and decide to go find Thanos.The moment between Thor and Captain Marvel was fitting. Two powerful beings recognizing one another.The emotional toll the audience feels from the aftermath of the snap 5 years later.Tony finally getting the family he always wanted.I am one of the few that thought that Nat's death was a satisfying conclusion. In the first Avengers she describes the way her and Barton met, and how she owed him a debt. She sacrificed her life because she knew Clint was going to get his family back.Tony seeing his dad.A few moments in the final fight scene. There were parts I did not like (Cap summoning lightning after Thor had restored his worthieness)Tony's death. I felt this was the only way that Marvel could continue without him. They couldn't just retire Tony because that is not who he is. It was fitting how Peter apologized and Pepper told him that it was okay to finally rest.Sam becoming Captain America. I know Bucky becomes the new Cap first, but with his Winter Soilder past, I think it is more appropriate for Sam to wear the stars and stripes.Con's:Fat Thor. I read up on it and apparently Chris Hemsworth and the directors really wanted to do this. I was not a fan of it. To me it just doesn't feel like something Thor would do. That's not the man that Odin raised him to be. I can understand being depressed and feeling guilty, but he wouldn't have turned his back on his people. I was expecting Thor to have a dream where he would talk to Odin and snap out of it and become the Thor from infinity war. Any time that Thor has ever felt unworthy, Odin had always been there to reassure him of his worth and power. I thought Thor was going to turn down Hulk and Rocket, have a dream about Odin, then show up at the Avengers facility looking like his old self. They built up Thor and finally did him justice in Infinity War. But then completely diluted his power from start to finish all for a few ""laughs"".Hulk. I thought the Professor Hulk had so much potential. He had the best of both worlds. Banner's intelligence and Hulk's strength, but instead they made him a pacifist. Ever since Avengers, they have slowly diluted his power and made him more of a joke.Cap. There is no way that Captain America abandons his duty and goes back to the past in order to hide. Wouldn't that mean that Bucky is still the Winter Soilder? Sam Wilsom never becomes the Falcon? Tony is still selfish and arrogant? Does he just watch all of the chaos from the past movies and shrug his shoulders and go back to his new life? It does not make sense to me. Marvel set up the perfect way to give Cap a chance at a family life with Sharron Carter.Thanos. Infinity War finally gave us a villain that we could understand and empathize with. There was a valid reason to his madness, however in Endgame they kill that Thanos and give us a one dimensional blood thirsty murderous Thanos. It was like a fleshy Ultron. Infinity War Thanos gave us emotion that no other villain gave us.Time heist. I am not going to even try explaining this. I tried to follow and once the movie comes out on DVD, then I will rewatch it and try to focus on the reasoning behind it. It left a lot of plot holes to me.Tony's funeral. I felt like it was rushed and I was really expecting to see a statue of Tony like Thanos hoped they would build for him.All in all I thought the movie had some really good moments and some really bad moments. I gave it 6/10 stars because I felt the good moments slightly outweighed the bad. I personally do not think it was a good enough wrap up to all of the films that came before it. I felt it was rushed and was made for the generation of fans that started watching the movies about 5 years ago. The fortnite scene made that pretty evident. I felt like they should have gone back and rewatched every movie in a weekend before even attempting to write a script. I felt like the energy that made those movies was not present in this movie. I know a lot of people will initially disagree with me, but go back watch all of Phase 1, 2, 3, especially Avengers, AoU, Infinity War, and then watch this movie. I promise you will not feel like it deserves 10/10."
1469,"It s a joke after another joke. No pathos. No Drama. I m a diehard fan from comics, and they kill all my dreams and expectations. It was impossibile to fail the movie after the masterpiece of IW...but Disney is Disney: they must follow specific political choiches without really caring about it (race and sexual politics), and it s all a mess. What a miss opportunity..."
1470,"Boring, predictable and corny. Thor was the only good thing. Absolute trash"
1471,"I saw this with my entire family in a theater.
It was house full with too much clapping n whistling n some of the dialogues went bouncer. Will watch it again but I feel it is not on par with Infinity War.
In Infinity War, the war sequence n the fight scenes were all shot in broad daylight n that too in an open field of Wakanda without the fast paced camera tricks. It was visible who was fighting who but Endgame's war sequence is shot in the dark with too much fast paced camera tricks. At times it became hectic to make out who is fighting who.
The entry of Thor during the war in Infinity was epic but in Endgame it was duds.
The entry of Captain America with the background sound to save Vision in Infinity War was again epic but in Endgame it is not at all exciting.
Rocket's one liners were good though."
1472,"For a Marvel movie it was ok, better than most. However this has no place being higher ranked than Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, Every Kubrick movie ever made and many more. People should take of their Marvel fanboy hats and stop shoving these movies to the top. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy them, but stop inflating the reviews just based on the fact that you grew up with the characters and judge them on the movie itself."
1473,"Far too many issues with this film, I'm not sure where to begin...A halfwit could have predicted the plot, to me it seemed lazy. I was really hoping for better fluidity between emotional/dialogue scenes and action packed moments. The pacing was entirely wrong, with the first 2/3 of the movie dedicated to mourning, confusion and Tony Stark's miraculous time travel discovery (which took him about two minutes to figure out). Now, I understand they needed to set some things up for later, but when you're making a three hour film and only allocate about 45 minutes to pure action in one block, it can get stale very quickly.Why give less substantial characters like Hawkeye an absurd amount of screen time? and expect us to 'feel' something when they lose their family to the snap.Couldn't help but feel bad for Thor throughout the film, they truly butchered his character, especially after such a success with Ragnarok. Storm breaker was essentially useless, and apparently had zero power the second time round (even though Thanos lacked the gauntlet). Oh, Captain America can use Thor's hammer......let's just imagine that's a thing. Inconsistencies like this make it truly difficult to appreciate this film. It seems as though they have twisted the plot in many cases for convenience.Thanos wasn't Thanos. Knowing that he hasn't lived through the snap and the journey that he went through in the first film, it's hard to see him as the menace that was established in Infinity war. His character development in infinity war is what made him such a captivating villain, we sort of forget this in Endgame.The final fight was Wakanda 2.0, not much changed here. Again, this felt lazy (and convenient)Don't get me started on that female empowerment scene (you know the one I'm talking about), it's just cringe. Nobody has an issue with the concept, but the delivery was poor and forced.I can only imagine how hard of a task the Russo brothers had with this film, but after all the hype and anticipation, it did not deliver.I'm also quite baffled by the amount of 10/10 reviews i'm seeing, hence why i've decided to give this a rating of 1, to help balance it out (as all things should be)"
1474,"As the only, UNIQUE, AND BIGGEST REAL FAN OF MARVEL, who loved every sigle movie, character, and comic from them, I have to give this movie a 1/10, so maybe they could delete it and make it again, but RIGHT this time... and let's pretend ENDGAME NEVER EXISTED...COME ON! BAN RUSSO'S BROTHERS FROM HOLLYWOOD FOREVER!! PLEASE!! DONT MAKE THEM DIRECT MORE MOVIES! THEY RUINED IT! the writers gave them a GOLDEN script, and Russo's TURNED IT INTO DUST! they ruined it totally!! where was vision??? hulk??? anyone??? cap lifting thor hammer?? really?? that's not any surprise, that's OBVIOUS! cap was even more worth than thor since the beginning!!!!! HULK should have lifted the hammer, that would have been epic!! and a surprise! but, where was him?? he didnt even fight... the strongest and original avenger... and he didn't even show up end in the last 2 movies of this era.... NO, NO AND NO! I should give these guys a lesson of how to write, produce and direct a movie, HUGE MISTAKES that even a 5 years old kid would have avoided!"
1475,"A movie review must be without desire or force.
This is the first film of Avengers Saga in which I found about 10 mistakes and so I am disappointed and very dissatisfied.
1. ) What would happen if Winston Churchill or Hitler of 1930 come to 2019 and got killed by someone ? Certainly the past will be charged, but the movie says nothing will change.
What would happen if you go to the past of year 1930 and killed Hitler ? Of course the the past will be charged but the movie says nothing will change.
2.) Caption America is a man, then how could he able to successfully and permanently use the hammer -🔨 Mjolnir ?
3.) Do you know the name of the place which created the 🔨 Mjolnir or weapons of Asgardians ? How can Avengers's laboratory more capable than that place (Nidavellir). In the Endgame there was no harm to Infinity Gruntlet of Avengers even after 2 times use. But the Gruntlet of Infinity War movie, created at Nidavellir, was destroyed only after 1 time use.
4. ) How was it possible for Iron Man to hold and successfully use all the six Infinity Stones. He is simply a man or half robot.
5. ) In Endgame, Thor went to his past and got his hammer and returned to his future with that hammer. Then, what would happen with the Thor of the past ? Suppose we went to 6 August 1945 and returned to the future after stealing atomic bombs, then what would happen with Japan ? Suppose we went to 1940 and kidnapped Stalin and returned to the future with him. Then what would happen with WW2 and the USSR ?
6. ) A man can create more capable weapon than God ? A man can handle a powerful weapon of God ? We can change our past without changing our present or future ?Avengers Endgame is a highly exaggerated and superfluous movie trying to please and satiate 100 percent audiences."
1476,"I went and saw this movie on premier night with my friends. It was unfortunately not the movie it was meant to be.Instead of the end result of an 11 year buildup what we were served was a steaming pile of garbage.The Adam Warlock tie in at the end of Guardians 2? Trashed. Instead we get dead faced Captain Marvel with a Rachel Maddow haircut (she goes through three haircuts in one film).In the name of social justice and inclusivity Adam Warlock gets benched so we can get the Women's Power Hour after 2/3rd of the movie being a comedic time travel romp down memory lane. Yes, that's right, you're paying to see movies you've already seen. Congrats. But hey, great re-use of those intellectual property rights. There's also plenty of inconsistency like mortals can touch infinity stones now and the end twist allows for them to break their own rules about time travel.The movie is overwhelmingly disappointing. It could have been, should have been, so much better. This isn't the movie we deserved. I won't give another dollar to Disney."
1477,Really good first half. Dreadful second half. Really boring. About 50% as good as infinity war. Very disappointing
1478,"Honestly I cannot believe how many fanboys are calling this perfection.My review is unpopular but I'm sure many will agree.1. Fat Thor is pathetic, why ruin the strongest coolest of them and turn him into Lebowski ?2. Hulk..... What do I say.... So much Hulk screentime yet sooo disappointing.
Geek, soft and calm Hulk ! Seriously !!!!3. So much time waisted on time travelling, omg the first 1.5 hours was just a bore.4. Captain Marvel was just pointless, why even bother introducing her at the 11th hour ?5. Cap America all of a sudden uses Thor's hammer, come on !!!!6. Beating Thanos was just too easy, too quick too easy.7. Only Nat and Stark die, it's Thanos what the hell !!!Anyways if the rest loved it good for them, but 7 disappointments at 3am without thinking too hard, it's 3 out of 10 from me.If you're wondering the first half was a 10 from me."
1479,"Real shame this movie didn't stick the landing as I'm a big fan. Enjoyed the first 20 minutes or so but after that the movie can't decide on a tone, many of the jokes fall completely flat and many character decisions are made purely for fan service instead of servicing the story. By the end I was left with a movie confused about its identity."
1480,"NO SPOILERS AHEAD, just an honest review from someone who makes a living working in the film and television industry.ENDGAME had a daunting task of following up arguably the greatest MCU film of all time so I can appreciate the Russo's even attempting it but that being said this film's master plan was poorly executed. Ranging from poor character development to lazy writing along with multiple plot holes and obvious continuity errors that should not have gone unnoticed (shame on you, scripty) the film was just..... A let down. A tremendous let down.Things to do instead of watch this movie:
1.) Rearrange your sock drawer
2.) Call that aunt that used to gift you batteries as a kid but no toys to put them in
3.) Mow your lawn. Even if it's freshly cut you would still be better off mowing it again than going to see this nonsense."
1481,"Infinity War is possibly one of the greatest movies there ever was. It has superheroes, comedy and suspense in spades and has you on the edge of your seat for two and a half hours. If you're not laughing you are biting your fingernails.Endgame is not half the film of its predecessor. It could have been a masterpiece if the writers had only continued the same formula. Instead they turned it into something resembling an Ironman and Captain America tribute.One of the most appealing things about Infinity War was that all of the heroes had major parts, had amusing lines and were in situations that made you care about them. Endgame features appearances of about 1 minute for the majority of the Avengers except Ironman, Captain America, Antman and Hawkeye. Even Thor who had a lot of screentime is diminished and for no particular reason. I mean, this god nearly killed Thanos, yet in the next movie is reduced to a comedy sideshow?In all honesty the movie feels rushed, it's like they had a timeline to get it finished and went with the script that was the best of a poor bunch. I mean, what was the point of Captain Marvel and the major movie before? She featured for about 30 seconds in 3 hours. Infinity War insinuated she would have a major say in the outcome yet her screentime was barely worth a credit which was the same for most of the other Avengers. In fact, why market this movie as Avengers at all?After all of the hype and the absolute triumph that is Infinity War, two and a half hours with little more than talking, then one fight scene resembling, but not a patch on, the Wakanda fight does not give this movie a right to a good rating. MCU phase 3 should have finished with Infinity War, on a high at the end of a rollercoaster with questions that need to be answered. Endgame leaves the questions answered, but does it in a tame, humourless way.Instead of moving to phase four with a bang, Marvel have gone with a fingersnap...Saying that, at least I can now say I have a body like Thor!"
1482,"When looking past previous Avengers movies and solo films respectively that included Black Widow, you wonder if she ever was part of the team, an Avenger. A woman whose past was never taken serious, her narrative taken away from her by the egocentric male heroes who treated her like their secretary rather than a teammate. Romanov did NOT deserve such a crude and dismissive ending. I will say the same thing for the rest of the female characters that were alive and could've gotten more spotlight than the ""boys"" fighting about their little toys and reminiscing about past times. I saw no true Avengers in Endgame; it was dull, slow, and it felt like a movie re-run of past events. Hulk was irrelevant, no rage, no epic fight against Thanos; Thor was more of a broken human than a superior alien who possessed far more experience in battle, far more powerful, yet he was just a lamentable junkie missing his mommy; that's not how a king rules. ""Sore-Eye"" was such a butt-hole to look at, a criminal by choice; murdering people that had nothing to do with his family's demise, but the Russo's felt like he deserved the redemption just to keep the plot going, frankly, this character was quite insufferable and useless, and in my opinion: he should've had die instead of Natasha. Captain Marvel's introduction was hostile and dense; the woman looked like she had no idea what was going on and not appropriately welcomed by her new teammates, so it felt like a high school newbie who just entered the classroom being introduced to bullies, and I think this character could've worked better being introduced after Endgame. The chemistry between the characters that Infinity War provided was lost in Endgame with its useless plots and predictable outcomes. Thank the force this is over."
1483,"So the Avengers attempt to redress the wrongs of Infinity War. The try to head Thanos off at the pass with a nifty piece of time travel thanks to the return of Antman from the Quantum Realm. It seems to take an age to get that point and then it becomes very messy. It doesn't really get much better. The finale battle is a re-run of the battle of Wakanda with some missing fighters showing up this time.
There are some nice touches, but it's a real drag. Anyone hoping that this would be Captain Marvel's show will be disappointed."
1484,"Completely overrated movie, infinity wars was a great and bold movie, it built a lot of expectations on an interesting and smart sequel but End game was quite disappointing, I was really expecting a more interesting movie with some twists, but nothing, it was predictable and bland and it didn't make a lot of sense either."
1485,"A movie I feel like I've been waiting an eternity only for it to be a mild disappointment. I'm a huge fan of Marvel comics and have followed the movies with anticipation without any real misses. This was suppose to be the ultimate climax and while there were some nice twists it was in danger of unraveling, but they did just manage to hold it together. The final scenes are very good and ties up the story nicely, but it doesn't excuse the previous 3 hours of ass-numbing tedium"
1486,Hoszú unalmas vontazotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttvontazotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttvontazotttttttttttttttttttttttttttttvontazottttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
1487,"1. Time travel is a joke not time travel
2. Thor huge flop! Why?
3. Hulk. Laughable. Strongest with ZERO Punches
4. Producer cameo is a vomit. No need!
5. 3 hours is wasted
6. Captain America picks up Thor's hammer. How? Why? With lighting! New king of Asgard.
7. Final battle joke! Infinity war light years better
8. Plot. As a stand alone movie doesnt deserve 1.
9. Multiple other timelines created which ruins the existing that was built up since day 1
10. Thanos. Greatest villain. To the drain. Out of character. Flop.
Bloody over the top hyped with no weight at ALL.
MASSSIVE disappointment.
Infinity war 100X better movie!"
1488,Not one time did the scene after a scene make sense or have anything to do with the previous scene. I know this was a kids movie really but wow. I wish luck to all that come after me. The future is not bright. Maybe one of you can stop this. I feel like I watched 4 different movies all just settiny up movies to suck more moneu from my wallet but im done. Chris Pratts likeability will no longer fool me into beliveing this film series has a heart. It does not. It is evil personified. Hollywoods sins on a silver platter. Hope you have hot sauce to choke down this garbage.
1489,Definitely the end of an era...Figure the studio will reboot at this point.
1490,Thank you Stuart Little for saving the universe. I'm excited for the next Stuart Little movie which I'm guessing is a prequel to this movie.
1491,"What did they do to Thor? My Favourite Character?What did they do to the Hulk? Hardly an ExplanationSold out Black Widow..This was one of the worst ways to wrap to the end of an era, They destroyed the characters so much that i had no reaction to the climax for each of them.Also the scene where all the women get together #Cringe If you want to highlight how powerful the women are how about show them working with the guys in that scene?It was awkward that actually Thanos was right and there was no need to try and right things..Very disappointed and will not watch Marvel again"
1492,Just saw Avengers Endgame and I feel disappointed. I loved Infinity War and seeing this makes me want to just end the story with Thanos winning in the last film. The humor was entertaining but severely misplaced. Many characters did not feel like themselves and even with all the references to past marvel films I feel cheated. I don't want to spoil anything for you guys so i'm just gonna leave it there.
1493,"I really wanted this to be the best ending ever but I was so disappointed. The other Avenger movies were very enjoyable but this one was different. Like Dr Strange said there are so many ways this could have ended. Unfortunately, in order to close the many arcs the story just felt forced, poorly paced with many many liberties taken that should not have been like the ""storm trooper wielding a light saber moment"" with Captain America. They also manage to get every woman in the film in the frame at the same time looking real tough. Do we really expect that 3.5 seconds of supposed girl power to inspire anyone? Give me a break! It's very condescending IMO. Also I felt like other characters were not properly utilized. Technically the film looked really good and the acting was great. I'll watch it at home once and probably never again. It will still make tons of cash and a lot of people seem to be satisfied."
1494,"We already knew the story, the avengers trying to un-do what Thanos did in infinity war, for me this movie lacked of personality, I would have loved to see more relationship between characters, i liked the changes they did with some of them (Hulk), but there were characters that had insignificant appearances also.
The pace was not that bad for the runtime, but in the middle of the film I was hoping to see more challenges for the characters, and more drama, it looked like the movie lacked of effort. For the budget they had, they should've done a very great movie. This one didn't surprised me, infinity war was way much better. Disappointing movie really."
1495,"Unoriginal, way too long, more comedy than action, outstanding special effects as usual but the story was so lame. Expected way more out of this. I wish I would have waited to watch on dvd or TBS for free!! Waste of money and time"
1496,Unfortunately the cast and characters were not enough to carry this three hours of dribble. Once they decided to take on the time travel theme it really spelt the start of the end. The movie is horrible overcooked and confusing and makes many of the fatal errors shared by other time travel horrors
1497,"Infinity War was fantastic, I expected End Game to top it but it was.... very disappointing to say the least. Thor a beer drinking slob. Hulk a teddy bear. Ant-Man accidentally saved by a rat walking over some buttons. Iron Man figuring out time travel in a single day.The movie was obviously promoting woman as the heroes, the men were weak and emotional wussies overall.Lesbian captain Marvel could have ended everything in the blink of an eye but she just left in the beginning of the movie only to return to take down the entire alien force spaceship in 3 seconds yet she couldn't take on Thanos who knocked her out with one blow. Thanos who was killed without any effort in the beginning of the movie mind you. Thanos from before Infinity War was killed in the future yet everything still happened. Nebula killed her past self yet still existed. Captain America deciding to stay in the past yet reappearing in the same timeline. Thor taking the hammer from his past leaving his original self without one? People picking up infinity stones like they were regular stones. It made no sense at all.The death of the two avengers triggered no emotional response with me and it's pretty easy to make me cry with emotional scenes, this did nothing to me. I found myself sympathizing more with Thanos, the villain in this story who actually seemed like a pretty nice guy trying to cleanup the mess in the universe than these ""heroes"" who only wanted to get their family members and friends back."
1498,"Avengers: Endgame (2019)
BROKE MY SCALE 20/10""A finale so masterfully constructed, Avengers: Endgame proves to us that a finale WILL do whatever it takes to treat the fans with an emotionally moving, action-packed masterpiece.""I am just blown away by how well Endgame does for itself. My expectations were stacked, and the film somehow managed to surpass those expectations. Like Infinity War, Endgame manages to strategically balance the humor with the seriousness of specific aspects, you'll either be laughing or crying, or both at certain points. The action still stands out as a fair product of entertainment, going to the extremity of any situation, no matter how impossible it may have seemed; taking risky moves to get the film's point across the table. Lastly, the characters are so well written in this, sometimes its just hard to believe that our original heroes conclude their stories in this tearjerking finale; it really is hard to say goodbye sometimes when we've grown on these characters since day one. I can even say that Thanos' character is basically given the upgrade in sociopathic motive, making him somewhat unpredictable just like the predecessor. The film does have its minimalistic flaws (like any other film) but I felt that these flaws are completely ineffective towards the the whole idea of what points the film intends to display.Verdict: Avengers: Endgame marks the end of an era that lasted 11 years. It concludes a story so fashionably well, its safe to say to bring the tissue and bring the applause, because there's no way in hell anyone was prepared for this epic finale.
One more thing, I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in the making of Endgame (especially the Russo Brothers), and anyone who contributed to the build up to this conclusion we've all waited for. And a final thank you to the man himself, Stan Lee, for showing us that the real heroes are the fans because WE made it happen. May he rest in peace, thank you for reading folks."
1499,"I wanted to like this, but it's tough ask when it recycles so much it felt almost parody like. A key character's death is dealt with almost flippantly on two occasions, the main story action is not great and feels re-hashed. It felt like a lukewarm follow up film so in hopes no-one notices it just throws every character at it in the closing section going for epic but it just felt a bloated mess.In the battle for screen time ego it's clear who comes out on top but this isn't an Iron Man film and shouldn't have been. Concentrating on the wrong characters led this down the wrong path. It should have been called Avengers: Inevitable."
1500,"I am still trying to put together what I truly felt about this movie. It is so long, large and grand that everytime I focus on some aspect I realise new elements I like or dislike.To some extent this is key to the problem. I found the first part of the movie enjoyable, both on entertainment but also in regards to the expectations one has to ""the end of an era"".It tries so hard to cover every aspect of the world that I felt that it was waaaaay to obvious in the story. Regarding this I truly feel like the movie would be better with two parts of equal length.Throughout the entire movie I felt like it took every expected turn it could. Sure it tries to throw you curve balls, but when you on hindsight think about it you never really get surprised. At least not to the scale and seriousness they delivered in the last movie.But as the second part of the movie hit and the final showdown started I immediately felt wronged. And what a downfall it would be.I know that marvel is a moneygrabbing greed machine that does its best to stay within the largest group of viewers expectations. They cater to the easy masses at EVERY turn and never does anything that would trigger a person.Captain Marvell was bodyshaming in her movie? Let's make her look like an angry feminist at a rally.To many men? Let's take every woman in the marvel universe and desperately focus on them. Even when it is forced, unneeded and strained. Cram it into the same shot and just do it.Are the white men to powerfull and good-looking? Just wait until you see what they do to Thor.Need army able to take on any enemy possible, without any superpower? Just add wakanda..But what brave strong nordic warrior should take up the mantles of king of Asgard? Sure as hell not a nordic warrior..The list goes on and trust me.. every incel triggered ""man*, WOMEN or attack helicopter must be catered to."
1501,"Characters getting to little screentime, one of the biggeste heroes reduced to comic relief. Former build-ups waisted. No clever twists. Loong wait while the heroes reminisce. A great bad guy turned stereotypical.
Meh... for me the line best ended with Infinty War. That was a great movie"
1502,The Infinity War was 10 times better. The end game is just way to long and boring
1503,"IW was way better, this movie did not deliver, I actually even preferred Capt Marvel."
1504,"This movie was a proper letdown for me, mainly due to it being made in service of the characters and not in service of the movie, unlike Infinity War.I think this movie could've been great or even a masterpiece, because Infinity War certainly was, but for people that aren't invested in the characters and don't like that same old corny comedy and totally predictable outcomes (and major plot holes), it was definitely a letdown.I'm not saying it's a bad film, how could it? It's a good film that could've been great, that's all I'm saying."
1505,"I like those superhero movies and I watched all the Avengers movies, some of them better some of them worse...
Guardians of the Galaxy number one, would be the best for me, so I am looking for some action and a lot of humor.
We were waiting for this one with my family and then we all find out that the movie is too long and ... quite boring...
It was half into the movie when I felt that the movie didn't start yet.
There are some over cooked scenes, not enough humor and too much drama.
Why the heck Captain America can hold hammer....:?)
Going into past movies always have for me the problem, of going into past again and again... ok, it's just a fantasy movie and we all knew that after last one, all those great characters needed to reappear...
Overall: overcooked, too much drama,a bit boring and disappointing... as the last Avengers raised the bar quite high."
1506,"First of all, visually this is amazing movie. I saw it in Imax 3d and i feared i will not enjoy it , because action movies with fast scenes dont feel so good in 3d, but because of its slower pace, one could really enjoy the scenery, especially the space scenes. I generally liked the plot(going back in time etc), although there are serious holes in the plot but whatever, its a comic book fantasy movie so anything goes, right. Going back and revisiting crucial moments was also done very well,funny and reminding of all the other great MCU movies, it really tied up everything well. There was not so many obvious jokes, but still few good funny moments.
The downside for me is how I never can understand how this superheros match their powers - like in the beginning, Captain Marvel grabs Thanos, Thor slices him up like a chunk of butter,. but on the end fight, she cannot get to him, and Thor fights him both with his axe and hammer, plus Captain America and Iron-man and they cannot do anything to him. Thanos has some strange looking blade which is obviously much stronger than all their weapons , and Captain Marvel. So this really bothers me even in the previous movies, is like the script writers can write whatever they want and anything goes, right. Again you can see, I can tolerate so much BS until i start to get bored and feel like i dont have an IQ less then 80 or im 12 years old.
I dont see why it had to be 3 hour long, they could easily cut down the drama BS and make it 2.5h. Also, I am really really sad that Black Widow is gone - she was the best for me, a true hero without any gadgets, super powers or powerful weapons. And finally, its sad that all american series and movies put a lot of point on the characters making a drama , fuss and blaming each other - adults and especially super heroes should be more balanced - and that was Natasha's part in the MCU, she was always so rational and calm .
I will watch this once more it comes out on Bluray but i dont i will be coming back more then that. Unlike the first Avangers, or even Infinity war.."
1507,"I thought that Endgame will blow me away, I was wrong. Infinity Ward was an amazing movie, it got 10 out off stars and it just a flawless masterpiece with no errors just pure art. Endgame is full off meaningless crap like the awful humor with cheesy one liners that just destroys the entire movie. It's not funny please stop it I thought while the movie just keep going with these lame and embarrassing jokes that just bored and got me mad at the movie to the point that I wanted it to end but it never did. Another bad thing is that Endgame is so predictable that its just a joke, you don't even have to watch the movie to know how it ends. But the movie did entertain me and it really got tearing up scenes that left me emotional and great character ark, acting and action scenes, but the problem is that there isn't enough of these elements to save the movie, and what's left is a big letdown. Good dammit."
1508,All 6 stones took from various positions at time line and collected at 2019. Also Thanos came to 2019 from 2014. After the fight Cap returned all 6 stones to where the brought. ( It should be teseract and Loki's wand. Not the stones. ) But Thanos vanished at 2019 means no return of Thanos to 2014. It means there is no effect from Thanos after 2014. No first snap from Thanos. It means no endgame at all.Okay then. If changing past doesn't change the present then why the hell Tony and Natasha can't bring back.
1509,"Just came back from my viewing and wow, what a bitter taste in my mouth. This 3 hour flick was supposed to be the biggest one yet and there was so little. The fun finally kicks in after 2 hours and 15 minutes. Everything before that was pretty boring. It's honestly not as ""amazing"" as people made it out to be. It was genuinely a one-and-done movie. Don't get me wrong I like some of the MCU movies, but I had a better time with Infinity War than with this installment. I don't think I could see myself paying for this movie again any time soon."
1510,"I just love how the people hate it when the Youtube rewind comes out, and swallow the same agenda in a Marvel outfit. The whole plot is non existent, spiked with some fanboy pleasing absurdity and the compulsory fake sciense which doesn't make sense at all. The main contradiction is in the overall mood of the movie. In one second they emphasize how terrible everything is, then next minute they come up with at best a nose exhaling joke. The only good thing was that Captain Marvel barely appears on screen.
Huge missed opportunity of adding a Fortnite dance to the end of the great brawl, would have fit the spirit of the whole movie."
1511,"All those who give good rating for this movie are school children and paid reviewers. The whole story are insensible, predictable and too shallow. At the beginning, they (remaining of avengers) easily chop thanos hand and behead him afterward. But at the final battle, they are too soft and then beaten by the purple guy. And then came a red girl (wanda) who almost kill thanos easily. To make it worst, how could cap. Marvel make it too difficult to hold thanos' fingers with both her hands? This doesnt make sense. Some other incident also plague the movie, such as, there would be two zamora after hulk use the stones; where is captain marvel in the story? The writer seems to be unconfident and has no idea how to fit her in the story; dr. Strange come only to play with water; they want to end iron man career coz r. Downey has getting too old for the franchise. Infinity has been much better than endgame. Etc... Endgame is a total flop which best suit for a noob."
1512,"Never in my life have I left a review on here however I felt obligated to after sitting through three hours of absolute nonsense. The film began an I was just at a loss for words, it felt like a practical joke. However I held out hope that it would get better, it didn't, it got worse. The way some of these beloved characters have been portrayed in this film literally made my toes curl up in embarrassment, it's absolutely shocking. Lazy writing, and beyond anti climactic. I've seen so many 10/10 reviews on here I'm half convinced the film I seen was actually a joke and all these other people got to see a completely different film than I did.
I had so much hope for the Russo Brothers to make this a truly spectacular film and I didn't think it would be possible for them to mess up this bad. I had tickets to go and see it a second time later on today however I'd rather lose the money and not go than sit through it again. So dissappointed."
1513,After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .
1514,I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!
1515,"The first 30 minutes were almost all talk, so boring. They finally got to some action and humor but with too many characters to keep track of and an over the top storyline in ridiculousness, it was still just not that engaging, not to mention way too damn long. The first Avengers movie rocked. Every one since has been a disappointment unfortunately. Marvel and Disney need to recognize less is more still applies as a storytelling principle of great value."
1516,"Really, people think this is like 8.9?This means i am really getting old. I love Infitinty war and i went to the theater like super-hyped. During the movie i wanted to like everything, then when it was over I thought, man it was bad. I am sad, how is this possible?I am ok that this is being bad. But why people think it is ~8-9?
it is a good 6 max 7, but noooo..."
1517,"I was bored throughout this movie.
1. Nothing really happens for most of the movie and there are so many unnecessary long scenes.
2.There is one really good fight/ action sequence.
3. THEY DID THOR SO WRONG.
I watched Infinity war the night before and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. With endgame I was looking at my phone the whole time hoping something would happen."
1518,"It's like Marvel is just trying to kill itself, I was literally laughing so hard when I saw this stuff in the movies, I'm going to list it out instead of type it. (obviously, this is not everything that I saw but it's enough to prove my point.)
1. Captain Marvel, need I say no more (that haircut too LOL)
2. Male cast almost entirely removed, white males down to under 5
3. Ending scene where all the females stand up and fight together
4. Captain Marvel vs Thanos"
1519,"I hoped for more. It was very well done, acting and special affects but storylines were hard to keep straight. A true fan may need to watch it several times to pull things together. Didnt like what they did to Thor at all! Loved the new Hulk though! So incredibly heartbroken that Stark lost his life. So now what? End of the Avengers movies? Hmm!"
1520,"There's a moment in one of Scream franchise openings that a girl makes a comment about the Stab franchise (the movie series within the movie). She says that even Stab series used time traveling because that's what they do when there's nothing else to tell.Funny enough, some of the Avengers makes a quite similar observation when Ant Man comes with this cliche idea. That was exactly the moment that I did remember that quote from Scream. And I couldn't expect anything different from that on.Infinity War was an amazing movie, first because it gave us all the feeling that heroes can fall, and villains can be more than just bad guys without purpose.Thanos is a villain because he was created that way, but his vision about the world and universe are unique and makes sense in his mind. When he snap his fingers and random people start disappearing, Infinity War made its point.At first, Infinity War was to be a movie divided in two parts, and the second part being the consequences and resolutions about the world after Thanos. A new era was about to be born, but suddenly it was stated that the 4th movie wouldn't be that way anymore.After finally watching Endgame, the reasons for that changes are very clear to me.First thing is that most of the fans couldn't stand the fact that some heroes have died, so writers had to think about a differet resolution to please them. Second is that Marvel failed to use it as an element of surprise to Endgame.What we see during 3 hours is an empty movie struggling to keep the pace of an entire cinematic universe created throughout a decade.As a whole, Endgame is only a redone version of Infinity War, and not exactly a follow up as it might seems. The consequences and resolutions are redundant when compared to the tragic ending of previous one. And yes, the time travelling plot was nothing else but a comfort zone to retell a story in a simpler way for the sake of a true ending.So, the clueless girl from Scream was right.Endgame had much more to tell than the way it was done. The plot development could have had dozen of different paths, and each one would have been much more interesting and still satisfying.I really don't understand how this movie became the biggest box office in history, because together with Age Of Ultron, is the weakest movie of the entire saga and entire MCU."
1521,I don't understand their logic it is so stupid. There are so many plot holes like when captain america did not return the future should change that is what they also stated if the the past is changed the future will also change.
1522,Avengers endgame might be long but it feels like the fastest 3 hour movie I've seen. Everything works even with the few plot holes. The action is evenly paced and works where they put it and all leads up to the greatest climatic battle scene in a long long time.
1523,"Actually, I can't understand why that many people enjoyed this movie so much. It's boring, illogical, predictable etc. Just an average movie about superheroes. The first part was much better in any aspect.Perhaps it's worth watching one time, but no more."
1524,"Was not expecting anything like that from marvel
so weak"
1525,"I'll start out by saying that overall the film was enjoyable and I did leave the theater with a certain sense of satisfaction. However, when you recap films in your head afterward and reminisce in your favorite moments I found myself going, wait....that doesn't make any sense...why did they do that????They completely trashed Thor and Hulk. They turned the Hulk into a geeky professor that could barely smash anything anymore They turned Thor into a self pitying drunk. Why? Thor has been through worse than this and yet now he's all of the sudden feeling so down on luck and depressed with life? This makes no sense. He's lost his mother, father, brother, home planet for pete's sake...he's been through worse! Why did they need to destroy Thor's character? And Hulk. I really enjoying seeing Hulk smash things. They turned him into more of a geeky old man than a brute.What the heck was the point of Captain Marvel in this movie? She had what....10 minutes screen time in the entire movie? It felt like the Captain Marvel movie was a 1 billion dollar GOTCHA from Marvel after watching this film. I was thoroughly dissapointed that we didn't get to see some sort of blockbuster fight scene between Captain Marvel and Thanos. At first she completely slaughters the mother ship in two quick flights. Then all the sudden she gets slapped across the screen like a tiny child? Seriously? She's more powerful than that! You gave yourself a powerful character with the Captain Marvel movie...do something with it!I am dissapointed that I won't get to replay happy film memories in the coming years. Overall, I think I got my money's worth with the film but I do feel like the directors royally dropped the ball. It felt like they did a really good job with Infinity War and then they realized that they dug themselves into a really deep hole that they couldn't direct themselves out of so they pieced this film together at the last second...."
1526,"Time traveling cliché... At the end of the last part I wished that this part would not be a ""Back to the future"" kind of plot. I mean, it could be more... Um.. Coherent. In addition, the unexpected quick pace of events. The time traveling plot is so controversial, you can't just make your own theory of time traveling and shove it down our throats. In conclusion, it was a fun movie but as a fan, sorry, you could've done it better."
1527,"I read a review earlier and it was spot on to what I was thinking.First off, with the demise of Black Widow and the upcoming solo film. Who would even care to go see it?Secondly and most importantly. Knowing what we know about Captain America. Are we honestly to beleive that he went back in time and just lived out his life with Agent Carter? I am sure that would have been his preference but sincenhe knows of all the goings on that are about to occur and with his sense of duty, honor, and justice he just sits back and doesnt lend a hand?Wouldn't the events that unfolded in The Avengers adventures have changed since Cap would not habe been there to help?This is not a bad movie by any stretch but all the rave reviews are unwarranted."
1528,Where was captain marvel and why is Thor fat? If I thought I had been responsible for half of all living creatures dying I would be pissed and use that anger to stay sharp and continue the fight. Like Hawkeye does. But no that make him a fat drunk. What a waste of money. Should have just waiting for it to be on Netflix
1529,"This truly was worth every second of the wait. Heartbreaking, brilliant, triumphant, every emotion possible hit me at different points in the film. The chemistry between the actors was amazing as always. Almost 3 hours and it felt like 5 minutes. Its 2 days since i seen it and 8 still feel like ive been hit with a brick. Spectacular end to a fantastic set of movies. Heartbroken that its over."
1530,"1st of all, how was the story, after they cut thanors head, first 40 minute of the movie is talking, talking, talking, then few action, then talk again for another 20 minute. Then time travel time. Then more talking. Only at 2 hour mark, you can see the fight scene, but only last for 22 minute, then talking again.. Boring boring boring.Now in detail. First 20 minute, after tony come back to earth by Captain Marvel help, then they search thanos, then thor cut his head easily.. This at least should have some action where thanos show his still strong. But instead boring opening.Then the movie goes after 5 years. Here, all Avengers are going others places either to help the remaining people or going quite and mourn. Why the hell it take so many minute of talking and asking for tony stark to join back and to go to time travel. His family life story is consuming the time and it is not necessary. And then to persuade thor to rejoin to go for time travel during his mourn, also talking so long.. Boring duration. It is also not necessary.Then some action from 1 hour mark during time travel to take all the stone before even thanos have any of the stone. Also so many talking scene. Black widow need to sacrifice her life for the soul stone, also talking somuch.Then the big action come at 2.08 hour marks when 2014 thanos manage to steal time travel things from Nebula and enter to 2019 with his war ship. Then its finish at 2.30 mark, Tony stark die after taking the stone from thanos so easily which is strange, and died because he snap his finger, then thanos died.Then the balanced of 30 minute is also boring, tony stark funeral was taking so long time, then talking again between hawkeye to scarlet witch.. Then Captain America go back to the past to send all infinity back to it original location alone, then he stayed in the past with his 1940's girlfriend.. Then he come back at old age just to tell falcon to hold the shield.. wth.. lame..Dont believe the hype, honestly from me that you will be yawning in the cinema for this movie.. Incomparable to infinity war which is by far the best Marvel movie ever.. I give only 1 star because great action scene."
1531,"Another fun movie to watch
4/10 for sure (imdb makes us compare this movie to godfather)
I just don't see any difference between this nice popcorn movie and others like ninja turtles, transformers and GI joe!
fun to watch but plz don't give it an oscar!!!!"
1532,The movie was enjoyable but it has way too many plot holes.I personally think Avengers Infinity War is better than this.It felt like this movie is too much of a try hard to impress the fans...rushing the plot in the end.It left a bitter taste.
1533,"Marvel keeps raising the stakes to impossibly huge proportions, catering to fans with winks and nods because they know they're guaranteed ticket sales from fanboys/girls who just want to catch every Easter egg. This isn't good storytelling at all. The bigger the villains are, the bigger and more overpowered the heroes have to be (Vision, Captain Marvel, Cap swinging Mjolnir, etc) or the more characters they have to cram into the film. Endgame did both! Wow! I'm done seeing Marvel movies.Things I genuinely enjoyed:Hawkeye. I would've watched this movie if it was JUST a Hawkeye movie. Badass. In fact, I think that would've been a really cool way to handle the Decimation aftermath and Endgame in general. Challenging, maybe impossible, but cool.Black Widow. A female character who's somewhat complex and doesn't have unexplainably magical powers to conveniently save the day (looking at you, Danvers). Also, somehow her relationship with Clint is just platonic (or is it, because of the implications of the sacrifice? But honestly, Clint's already lost everything else so it's a moot point). This is cool, since the bombshell is normally ""required"" to have a romantic relationship in every movie, and here she doesn't.Lebowski Thor. Especially his sweaters, and the fact that Tony Stark actually made a joke that adults like myself find funny. Wow. It's been a running joke that Hemsworth's contract includes a shirtless scene clause as the stereotypical hunk. This was delightfully subverted."
1534,"Summary: A terrible movie that should go down in history as the worst Marvel movie of all time. For me personally, the Marvel journey ended with Infinity War, and what the Russo Brothers tried to do with End Game is an insult to all the Fans.----Spoilers ahead----
The Plot/Script: with 3 hours you would expected a well structured story, yet the movie was rushed. As soon as the movie starts you will notice that the flow is not right, they skipped through Tony and Nebula's situation way too fast, going after Thanos the first time, figuring out time travel, obtaining the soul stone...so many Plot holes, from time travelling, to heroes powers, EVERYTHING just seemed chaotic and wrongly put together.Hulk: they introduce Professor Hulk which at first you would think would be a great idea, but the execution was terrible. From one of the strongest Super Heroes to a Shrek look a like character, who basically did nothing for 3 hoursThor: They disrespected this character...it was just sad to see what they did to him. Thor set the bar high in Ragnarok and Infinity War as probably the greatest Marvel character yet, they destroyed him in this movie...Iron Man: The one who started it all, and for poetic justice they wanted it to end with him, and it seems only fair....how it was executed though was plain ridiculous and didn't make sense. First of all creating a gauntlet in Infinity War showcased how hard it is to do so, yet the Avengers did it so easily with Stark's technology. Secondly, Tony stealing the stones right out of Thanos arms was .....and to top it all of, Iron Man being able to actually put on all the stones and be able to withstand the power of what most creatures cannot...(Hulk being able to do that could make sense)Forced comedy: Marvel did not learn from Justice League, when you try to force comedy to what should have been a serious movie, you will end up with a really...bad movie."
1535,This movie was more boring than all the other avengers. Its way too long. There's no action until the 3rd hour. Hated the force seens to push current agendas.
1536,Overlong and cheesy in the extreme. As a massive Avengers fan I was disappointed in the film. Who on earth decided to portray Thor as an overweight bloated drunkard?..That person should be hit with Thor's hammer. In a way I am glad that it has come to an end. It had become a money making machine at the expense of high octane adventure. Yes I will miss it but maybe not as much as I should!!!
1537,"Endgame was a big disappointment for me and my wife. Too long, it belaboured the storyline unnecessarily, Iron Man (RDJ) was the saving grace, the action was NOT impressive, THOR has been totally wasted and destroyed and so was his charisma, too much time was wasted on Time Travel research. Scarlet Witch wasted as before (Olsen was good in her scenes though) and the worst part Thor's belly and his hammers were being lifted by everybody - first Hela, then Groot, Vision, Captain America and then Thanos?? This was stupid. And Vision the most powerful and a real leader of the Avengers has been given a very weak personality and was nowhere to be seen in the Endgame. This was a stupid end to a good phase. Infinity War was much superior as a movie."
1538,"I honestly think all these reason make no sense, EVEN within the Avengers world:Captain Marvel can negate the desperation of Stark and Nebula's situation and fly an entire spaceship to earth without any effort.Captain Marvel explains she has to attend to other matters. What is more important than Avengers' mission? She should have been summoned immediately when there was even the slightest opportunity to undo Thanos' snap. Why not give the Avengers a new pager?Thanos is almost immediately destroyed when they find him. A cool battle scene would have gotten the movie off to a better start.5 years later....Ant man is brought back by a rat.Ant man's daughter seems to have aged more than 5 years.Thor is a beer belly de-masculined moron and never gets back in shape. Such a waste. It would be like watching a Rocky movie where Rocky never really fights.Tony Stark can invent a time machine in a few minutes but still does his own dishes. Why not use the 5 year time gap to explain this more logically even within the suspend your believes Avengers world.We now are in an MCU where time travel (without an infinity stone) was invented.Time Travel also means instant space wherever you want to go travel. So many opportunities to get the infinity stones straight from Thanos surely. Why not get them just before he destroyed them instead since they know the date and they know he is alone? Their first mission in the movie was based on going there with the knowledge he still had the working stones AND they had Captain Marvel on their side. Why not try this for real first when time travel is available instead of big problems they will inevitably run into (running into themselves etc)?Weird Time Travel rules to explain why they can't destroy Thanos as a baby but a lot of these rules make no sense considering what happens (old Captain America).Nebula doesn't tell Hawkeye and Black Widow about the soul stone sacrifice.The second soul stone ""sacrifice"" is nowhere near as dramatic as in the first movie. Even the same music is used though.The Hulk/Banner is still useless and never gets his revenge fight with Thanos. What a waste.Time travel is not like Back To The Future at all .... but it is. But Back To The Future 2 handles past events from the previous movie better. It shows the highlights, here we get some background stuff (elevator ride in 2012 etc). There was a better movie I reckon if they had to collect 6 stones from major events from the previous movies and get involved in these more.Thanos is a bumbling idiot who now wants to destroy the entire universe and start again rather than his far more reasoned mission in IW.Thanos doesn't need the stones to be immensely powerful.Captain America brings the infinity stones back (also the soul stone?) with a briefcase.Stark can place all the stones in his nano suit without anything happening to him (compare to Thanos getting each stone). But yet it destroys Stark if he uses all the stones.Gomaro knees Quill in the nuts. So stupid and heartless. Quill - Gamora relationship is erased. It feels like the Data 2 approach in Stark Trek.Gamora is mostly absent from the movie even though she played probably one of the most major parts in IW after Thanos. She's not even at Stark's funeral. No one cares.Captain America can use Mjolnir.Even with both Mjolnir and Stormbreaker Thor is of not much good even though he almost single handedly destroyed Thanos' army with Stormbreaker in IW.Seeing the snapped superheroes come back was cool but was left very late. Also we didn't really see the implications of normal humans coming back.Peter Parker and all his classmates (some unsnapped I assume) still in high school 5 years later.The 5 year time gap would cause so many problems. Where did people snap back? At their homes if they were in a plane? What if their unsnapped loved one was living with someone else by then? I really think the only way to have gone with this movie is if the unsnap happened straight away or the original unsnap was prevented.Younger Nebula can use the time machine to get Thanos and his army into the Future. Why can't older Nebula immediately send them billions years into the past where they would burn up in a young universe.Many individuals without physical power were on the battlefield including Mantis I believe. So weird.With the time infinity stone Dr. Strange surely could reverse Stark's death."
1539,"Before i doubted that ratings were bought. But now am sure of it. I was expecting alot of this movie , all i can say that the 1st 2 hours were really boring. Even the fighting part at the end was not as expected. What happened to hulk? Thor? Captin america some how carries thor's axe, howwww!. They just reuined this movie."
1540,"I can't even find the words to describe how dissappointed I am... All these years, all these movies, and all this build up of excitement - all for nothing.. I'll just watch ""Infinity War"" over and over again, until I forget they ruined it all like this.."
1541,"Whilst the visual effects are the highlight, this film did not delight or live up to the fantastic setup from Infinity War.The pace is off, the characters are painfully not funny or behave in ways which have been set out in the previous 21 movies.I have enjoyed TV series finales more than this. It was a huge undertaking to get to this point and generally the previous films were good, this for missed the mark.In Infinity War when Spiderman met his demise - that was a touching moment, this film cannot recreate that at all, I found the emotional scenes more amusing than sad or emotive.I do not want to write spoilers for the movie so that is all I can say but this for me was the worst MCU movie to date."
1542,The movie slowed right down and the old generic plot came into life because of the dialogue and acting. The movie turned heads and it became infinity war again but the feeling I had in infinity war was lost when the avengers came out going against the cgi mess which could be compared to gods vs humans. The movie had ups and downs but the highs were high and the downs didnt leave a bad taste in your mouth to make this a solid film
1543,"Infinity war was better than this garbage. 3hrs
Seriously"
1544,"I love the Marvel Universe and even though not every Marvel movie was fantastic I really enjoyed all of them. After reading many good reviews I expected a lot from this finale. But it was the first Marvel movie where I left the cinema feeling like 'I don't know if I really enjoyed this movie'.It's just way, way too much crammed in one single movie. A huge number of characters, some just came flying in out of nowhere not giving the viewer time to remember which character it is they're seeing. Combined with an enormous amount of locations, an enormous amount of story lines which went all over the place time-wise as a result of time travel. It was just too much. I really struggled during the movie to keep up with things.
So after all this time, all these great Marvel movies I expected to be blown away. But I'm actually just really disappointed... For me this finale is Marvel unworthy. Shame."
1545,"Too slow. Too boring. Way too long. Too much drama. Seriously did we have to delve into everyone's past? And every team that went back for the stones encountered universe shattering difficulty. Wow so original. What was Marvel thinking? I had high hopes for this finale but it definitely did not deliver. The actors delivered respectable performances. Unfortunately they were hampered by a 2nd rate script. And where was the humor of Ant-Man and Ragnarok that endeared us all to these famous characters? Dullsville. It was almost shameful the way Hulk was marginalized. Yeah I know all the legal garbage behind him not getting a solo film. But here was a chance to show us what he can do and you failed, Marvel. Speaking of Marvel, she was about as inspiring as Ben Stein. I did not care for Larson's rendendtion of the character anyway so her minimal impact was Ok by me. Sorry but this movie was very underwhelming. Too bad."
1546,"I really tried to like it but it was a cheesy movie. They really downgraded vs infinity war which was unique and cool. This was 90% scenes of superhero's crying and moaning about how life is so hard and 10% was actual action. Like the battle scene was the only cool scene in the whole film along with one or 2 funny moments like with drunk fat Thor and stuff and the cast being good. Storyline was rushed and stolen from other greater movies. Seemed like they wanted to wrap things up and go home. This was a sleeper and 3 hours is way too long they could've easily cut out many of those crying scenes and made it a 1 hour thing. Very cliche and cheesy movie, not worth the hype at all. I feel like most people only voted highly because the name is ""Avengers"" not because of the content it presents."
1547,"If they gave me a couple of free tickets to watch this movie for a second time, I would prefer to throw the tickets in the trash than waste more time with this. The time-travel story is a mess, and the whole thing is too long and boring. Infinity war was so much better..."
1548,"Endgame is a fun movie to go see, it has its problems but is a fun movie. These reviews on here giving it 10 out of 10 and saying that is the first perfect movie are 100% wrong. Dont go in expecting this movie to be better than godfather or citizen kane as these reviews describe. It's a fun movie with fun action, no it's not an oscar contender, no it's not a ground breaking never before been done movie, and no it is not a 10 out of 10 perfect movie. Go in expecting a fun watch with some cringy comedy and you will enjoy the experience. But dont listen to the people saying that this is a perfect movie, or the best ever made."
1549,A movie which was not expected but a movie which was truly deserved.
1550,"This movie is 3 hours of fanservice, but it all comes from the best place possible: from the love of this franchise, it's characters and to reward the fans such as myself. So I can't rate it like I wasn't a fan. Sorry.Visually it's always the best you can imagine. The final fight is jaw-dropping, with some really ""must use as wallpaper material"" shots like Cap standing against Thanos and his army and such.
The cinematography is stunning and more stylish than ever. Like the blurred image of Thor leaving Thanos' farm house with that beautiful music at the end of the first chapter of the film.
The IMAX 3D really comlimented the visuals here and there, but it's not needed.
The music is most likely the best from all Avengers movies here, even if it's not memorable like it's always tend to be, it really helps the tone.
People tend to say this is not acting what these people do in the Avengers movies but try to talk with green screen or while your colleague has some weird bubbles on him/herself and make it believeable for the audience. Don't underestimate these movies people like Thanos did with the Avengers.
The characters are all at their best here, at least who are in the meat of the movie. And all the bring back characters has their very little, but effective moments. The tragic moments will shock you, the funny moments will make you laugh your ass off, and all the in-between moments will entertain you. A lot of encounters and re-connetions happen in this film and all of them varies to heartwarming to wholesome to touching. Tony's daughter's line that Tony gives her back at the end is wholesomely touching. There are no dull or unwanted scenes I could think of. Even if you disagree with some choices the directors made they still great ideas, and show a new side of the characters. There are so many callbacks to scenes or lines that will make you smile, warm your heart or even cry that I couldn't count. The story is more interesting than Infinity War and never sits down for a moment, but gives some breathing moments for you to buckle up for the next big one. The twists and turns are mostly unpredictable, even if you thought who will die, they die in a surprising way.And with the previous statement we came to the really spoilery part of the review:HUGE SPOILERS:
The 4 best parts of the movie were for me all about to give the best farewells to Cap and Tony.
1. Cap uses Mjölnir in maybe the best coreographed and most heavy fight with Thanos is just a scene were you can't do anything else just cheer and be happy to live in this age.
2. Tony dies with the most memorable fashion, saying ""I am Iron Man"" to Thanos after we've seen the most satisfying scene ever: Thanos tries to snap but nothing happens, becasue Tony has the gauntlet he made with all the stones. And Pepper telling Tony at his final moments that everyone is safe and he can rest now made me genuinely cry the first time sitting in a movie theater.
3. Tony's funeral on the river where his house stands, with all his friends watching and the audience reading the text stating that there's the proof Tony Stark had a heart with his iconic chest plate is made me cry even more.
4. Cap finally goes back to Peggy to compliance his promise and dance with her is the perfect ending scene to his arc, and to this Golden Age of Marvel Cinema.
SPOILERS END!The only negative is that you didn't had to watch Captain Marvel for this movie, but that's not the movie's fault, but the false advertisement's. She doesn't contributes much, really dull and uninteresting but at least has really few screen time. And she does her job, being powerful and not stealing the show from the older characters who deserve the spotlights. Her hair is ultra lame tho, even if it was a reference to her late mentor. I could've be picky and say some characters could live if they used the stones and qauntum realm, butt that would've just destroy their character arcs in an instant. It works in movies like Deadpool where there are no rules, but not here. And for some of the characters really needed to die, and fulfill their purpose in the grand story.I could just go on and on what I loved about this movie, but that would be just boring and you will watch this movie even if you don't read a random 22 year old guy's review on the internet. So there are my closing thoughts on the movie and the Avengers franchsie in general.The Avengers in 2012 showed us something new and never done before, Age of Ultron with it's problems was a likeable and entertaining movie that had some great groundwork for later movies, Infinity War made the impossible come true, and Endgame complimented the fans of the series the best way possible that everyone will remember as the next decades come. Thank you Russo Brothers, the Avengers cast, everyone worked on these movies (even the weaker ones) and especially for Stan Lee to made my childhood dream possible... f.u.c.k. I'm crying even while writing this review. So it's time to END it here. Thanks for reading."
1551,"3 hours of absolute drag, cheesy predictable ending and so many God damn plotholes the entire time travel bs wack as hell"
1552,"(Caution minor spoilers) I have been a fan of every marvel movie to date but left the theatre feeling sadness ... and not because of emotion brought on by the film. This sadness was because of a variety of holes in the plot and our most powerful avengers (in the comics and previous movies) being reduced to a fat drunk god of thunder , and a not so Incredible but intelligent non-aggressive Hulk. And some how captain America gains the ability to shoot lightning? For this reason Thor (arguably the strongest avenger ever in the comics and also portrayed that way in the previous film Infinity War ) could have been completely removed from the end game because he is made out to be helpless and his abilities (which used to be those of a god) can now be possessed by humans. While all other marvel films remain true to the characters and there unrelenting will to save the universe, this film seems to take some of the strongest hero's in the MCU and reduce them to zeros. It left more questions then answers in an ending unfit for Marvels ""biggest"" film to date ."
1553,"It did its job at providing a satisfying conclusion for the quadrilogy. I don't think that it does anything exceptional or bad. Actually, that's not true. It does one thing exceptionally: It's three hours but I never felt the runtime. And it does something bad: The fat suit for Thor looked soooo fake.And I personally thought what they did with the Hulk was hilarious.But I'm honestly sick of Marvel at this point. I'm sick of superheroes and supervillains and the whole interrupting the plot to make a joke thing. And I can only see myself watching this again if someone else wants to watch it. I'm glad The Boys is a thing!"
1554,That is the sign of a good movie. From start to finish your basically glued to it. And the humor in it is better than expected. The action and special effects are above avg. Good story line to follow the previous movie.
1555,"I am not going to spoil too much. I just got disappointed with the storyline..
I believe superhero origins were missing in this movie. Character was developed with the lowest priority. And the ending was specially disappointing..
I expected a power punch of the superheroes what I missed specially of Thor.
This movie just gave me an example of highest hype with lower result."
1556,"People won't agree with me because they are blinded by the hype and grandeur of the movie and the way it has been marketed. But this is one movie that has dozen of flaws, stupidity and unnecessary forced humour scenes.
1. How on earth did Tony figure out time-travel is possible and perfectly safe in just a night, without any failures. Just for the sake of argument, he had help from Ant-man(which isn't shown in the movie), but let's just assume it, why a mind like Tony, the smartest on earth didn't figure it out earlier, why the avengers didn't even discuss time travel earlier during those 5 years ?2. Captain Marvel has disappeared from the entire movie, honestly Rocket had x3 times more screen appearance than the strongest marvel character. The avengers don't even speak her name or call out for help when going back in time to collect the stones. The director didn't even talk about it so the people watching it completely forget about her. And then she suddenly appears in the end scene.3. The entire plot is very mediocre, quite stupid and hastily made.4. Why o why did you ruin Thor, what was the reason behind it ? Don't tell me that he was depressed and defeated so he became a like ginger. Because 5 years of beer drinking and getting fat and all it took was 5 minutes of absolutely no convincing to get back into the game. Highly stupid and unnecessary.6. So much of time and effort and some amazing scenes are put into Infinity war to get Thor his new axe. And now the hammer is suddenly just back. Because the present Thor goes back to past and just takes the hammer and returns back. So what does the past Thor uses now ? And why put so much effort to create an awesome axe when you again brought back hammer. Absolutely no sense.8. A very minute but noticeable point. Apparently normal humans(clint and natasha) can breathe on the other planets without any issues, they all have same atmosphere and gravity like earth. For someone who is a fan of space and galaxy genre, finds it really stupid.9. When you go back and take infinity stones , and disturb that past reality it creates problems, okay that's standard time travel issue, so the solution is to put back infinity stones and everything is good. That's fine.
But the hammer was taken from the past Thor and wasn't returned. But no body cares about that. Apparently magically a new hammer will appear on its own somehow. From such a large scale franchise, one of the ugliest time travel stuff.
I can go on and on and on about the bad points in the movie because it has no end.
The emotional content of the movie is pretty good, especially the scenes involving Tony, pepper and spiderman.
Yes there are mistakes in every movie. But one can't expect such stupid stuff from Endgame. The largest movie ever in past two decades after having a runtime of over 180 minutes.
HIGHLY DISAPPOINTING.
Infinity War was the end to me. This is just unacceptable."
1557,"Perhaps some fans expecting a colossal/great war between thanos against the remaining avengers. But what endgame provide is simply an unlogical storytelling. First, they really dont know how to put captain marvel in the story. Second, there should be 2 gamora after hulk use the stones. Third, is that really hard to beat thanos while in the beginning the rest of the avengers easily chop thanos' head. Fourth, captain marvel make it too difficult to hold thanos' fingers for flicking? All of those issues are not sensibly accepted. The plot is too shallow, and they try to force the story to be realistic which absolutely uninteresting and rubbish."
1558,"I thought the mcu was going to change after infinity war but this garbage proved me wrong. I thought they would stop doing the same generic garbage crap after infinity war but nope. Tbh it still hurts that's they reversed infinity war, infinity war would still be a 10/10 if they didn't reverse it and I'd be a marvel fan boy but nope, they just had to turn to this garbage again."
1559,"Didn't live up to the hype even a little bit, and DEFINITELY didn't need to be 3 hours long. Ignoring the fact that as a writer I think time travel is a lazy plot device, it made no sense. You can't have the Ancient One lay out that by taking the Stones they create alternate timelines, and then create 2 alternate timelines, one where Tony had a heart attack and Loki got loose (which I know was to give the Disney+ show footing, but there were other ways to do it. Like, say, reverse one of the weakest deaths in the MCU. Just a thought.), and where Steve went back to Peggy. Which, I might add, makes end of the movie make NO sense. If by changing the past creates alternate timeline, how did Steve get back into our timeline to give Sam the shield?I haven't talked about Thor yet because I need to keep my blood pressure level but I'll try to be quick. Thor had an excellent storyline coming out of Ragnarok and Infinity War, about grief and power and I was really excited to see what would happen with his storyline in Endgame. So imagine how disappointed I was to see this Noble, fantastic character get turned into a running fat joke. And moreover, to see how his storyline was shattered so that he could be made into a joke. Marvel had the beginnings of a great storyline about grief and recovery and men's mental health (which is WHOLLY over looked in media), and threw it away to do that. Coming from the way they handled Tony Stark and PTSD, I really expected more from Marvel (and that scene with Rocket slapping Thor out of a panic attack? Not cool Marvel, not cool at all.)I will say that the ONLY reason I didn't give this movie a worse rating is because of that final battle scene. Absolutely gorgeous and without a doubt one of my favorite Marvel moments, especially Cap wielding Mjolnir.In conclusion, I read this fan fiction back in 2012, I didn't like it then and I don't like its filmed version any better. Watch the battle scene and the scenes with Tony and his daughter and then call it a day. Don't waste 3 hours."
1560,"I enjoyed watching the previous ones.Now this one is too long, 3 Hrs."
1561,"Endgame's here! We waited for it and it came fast as well. Just a year. Enough to generate the kind of buzz, MARVEL wanted. Because in front of Infinity War, This stands nowhere. It's my personal opinion so just relax. At the run time of more than 3+ hr, we waited for 2 hour just to realize it's all actually happened which was already there in the fan theories. Yet a fan has a patience to grant his left patience towards a climax which should have been better or more powerful than Infinity War. Honestly I felt more bad seeing those superheroes turning to dust in Infinity War rather than seeing the main Avengers dying in Endgame. And the time travel. So easy for them to make it happen right. An easy plan which was well executed by our Avengers. And they did get the stones back, all of them. Without any complications! Well this didn't worked for me. We have seen Avengers thriving to fight Thanos in Infinity War. But here, well I would just say poor Thanos! At our climax, everybody's a superhero. Literally everybody. Like they were just waiting to show up in the end somewhere behind the Avengers office. Emotionally, that's good but cinematically that's weak! No fear we had like the 'what if' moment in Infinity War. And honestly Infinity War stays over the top than Endgame in terms of action, plot lines, music, vfx. So here's my rating. 6. And by the way it's a one time watch, to fulfill the curiosity of the hype!"
1562,"A lot in Endgame was great but there were more than a few sub-par moments. There were numerous plotholes, including in relation to the major plot in the middle of the movie, they ruined several of the characters, and the final resolution was lame. And yes, there are about a dozen undeserved ""woke"" moments..."
1563,"The 22nd film in Marvel Cinema Universe has an end of term feel about it. This shows with the lack of post credit scenes.With the population of the universe halved, Thanos has completed his task.The remainder of Earth superheroes try to retrieve the Infinity Gauntlet but Thanos destroyed it.It is the appearance of Ant Man who escapes from the Quantum Realm and shows up on Earth after five years that leads to a plan and it involves a Time Heist.What is left of the team go back to different time zones and different parts of the universe to collect the infinity gems. This means re-enacting scenes from previous Marvel films such as Captain America 2: The Winter Soldier. It leads to a moment where Robert Downey Jr, Tom Hiddleston, Chris Hemsworth all vie to be in the same shot with a particular superstar actor who supposedly called time on his acting career last year.It is a big spectacle, there is a major battle that comes across as flat when it needed to be better choreographed. There are some emotional scenes with some characters among the fallen.However this is one long movie. It needed to cut at least 45 minutes from its running time. The time travel elements might make sense in comics but not here. At one point, I thought the Russo Brothers were going to outdo Peter Jackson by dragging the film's ending on and on."
1564,"The only word I could muster after the screen cut to black was ""Unbelievable.""The Marvel Cinematic Universe is an achievement in film like we've never seen before, and Avengers: Endgame is the perfect culmination of this journey we have been on over the last decade. I genuinely cannot comprehend a more perfect way to end this story along with several character arcs.Endgame takes all of the best things from the previous 21 films and packs them seamlessly into the 3-hour runtime that still somehow leaves you wanting more.
All of the main characters give pinnacle performances here (one in particular, which you might have a guess but I will refrain from saying here).Hours later, I am still mostly speechless. Nothing else I can put into words will be able to do this film justice. You simply have to experience it for yourself.If you're a lifelong Marvel fan, you will swoon over this film. It will touch your heart. It will go down in history. Now stop what you're doing and go experience Avengers: Endgame."
1565,This was a great movie but Thanos just battling everyone without the stones and somehow winning just annoyed me.
1566,"Well, just got back from watching this movie. I'm a long time fan of all the MCU movies since the very first Iron Man, seen each one of those 20+ movies 3 or more times each. I was in awe after watching Infinity War (IW) and I had the highest of expectations for the EndGame. The joy I felt watching Thor with his new blueish glowing axe and sparking eyes in IW was something imprinted in my mind. Yes, I really expected some glorified battle at least between Thor and IW did gave me the impression Thor is now the mighty superhero, the strongest at least to guide everyone else to whatever was planned to reverse the damage of Thanos in EndGame. Within the 15 first minutes instead of a mighty Thor, we get that laughable drunk guy??? WTF Marvel.Time travel? Ok... it may work or it may not in a movie. But honestly didn't feel like a suitable mechanism for the MCU universe. It felt like the ""easy to get back mechanism"" trick to restore whatever we have shown so far to the fans. I would rather prefer somehow an arcane ancient relic to be searched and found that would do the trick rather than this ""seen so many times"" approach of time travel. Honestly, didn't like the whole time-travel thing.The final battle... not even close to what we have seen in IW. Despite having every hero in there, it was very flat. Thanos was presented as just a bad guy, not that smart impressive genius and ""correct"" in his own mind"". He didn't had the stones, still he looked like he is indestructible. How come this guy has such strength??????? I could say ok if he had the stones, without them, he still is an impossible-to-beat hero.Captain Marvel... well I hope MCU does not expect this character to be the new superhero to stand up and carry the whole thing to phase 4. One major issue is she is much more powerful than anyone else. I can't connect with that easily. Even Thor which I believe is the strongest among all superheroes had to go through a lot of pain and suffering all these years to reach at least his maximum potential (to watch him ruined by the authors in the most disgusting way... but let's put that aside). Captain Marvel? No, right at the start she can fly, needs no air, spits fireballs and can bring down a whole spaceship in seconds. So, why the heck she wasn't there in the front line to finish this battlse right away?? Utter crap.Finally, deaths of superheroes. Why why why why why? If you want to retire a character, there are dozen other ways to do that. I felt like these were forced deaths. Ok, I can understand some could die one way or another but all deaths seem to be rediculous; the whole point was just to eliminate them from the future MCU. Ok, just retire the characters in a memorable manner, no need to kill them. It felt like a part of my heart was ripped away in the worst manner; completely unjustified deaths. Other reviewers explained that much better than me and I completely agree with them.Overall, it was of course visually brilliant but lacked in what matters, the story and this makes it an average film really. Not completely disappointing but didn't feel it made justice to the whole MCU phase 3 or as a worthy IW sequel."
1567,"My rating for this one is a 5.
I almost fell asleep at the first half of the movie.
The storytelling is poor, acting is so so, fight sequences are not what I expected. I liked Infinity War much better.
My expectation from a 9.1 score movie was pretty high and I was very excited to see this one. But what a disappointment."
1568,"I personally preferred infinity wars. This movies was so preditable and had so much feminist propaganda that it didn't feel natural at all. A balanced group of characters usually goes best. There was some funny moments to be fair and some few action scenes, but in general this movies just feels very commercial and does not manage to get my attention at any moment. The vilains were not great either!"
1569,"I'm going to break this film into 3 parts.
Part 1 - 10/10
Part 2 - 7/10
Part 3 - 4/10Part 1:
It starts off perfect - the scenes with Hawkeye, Nebula and Tony, and the twist with Thanos destroying the stones are all top notch.The perfection continues as we jump ahead 5 years. The emotional weight of the snap is still felt in our characters, and you really get a sense of the dread and despair.Then Tony discovers time travel in about 11 seconds.Part 2:
We get to the meat of the film, and some odd choices are made. The first are the drastic changes in two characters: Thor and Hulk. They are now pure comic relief. I am not a particularly big fan of either of them, and I thought Thor's transformation into The Big Lebowski was very funny at times; but boy do I feel bad if you're fans of these characters.The time travel scenes themselves are a mixed bag. Tony, Captain America and Ant Man stealing the Mind and Space stones is fantastic. Tony and Cap going back further in time, not so much. I know Tony has daddy issues - we dealt with this back in Iron Man 2 - and I know Cap likes the lady he knew for a few days back in the 40s. This is the bathroom break scene.Hulk retrieves the Time Stone by making up an absurd promise he can't possibly know he'll keep. The entire Thor and Rocket scene could've been cut without losing anything except Cap getting the hammer later in the film I guess.The Soul Stone scene with Black Widow's death didn't work for me. It's one thing if the person getting the stone has to sacrifice that which he loves. It's another if the thing you love makes the choice for you. It didn't work for me. Which is unfortunate because I like Black Widow and was disappointed to see her die.Nebula (who might be my favorite character in this film) sets up the return of Thanos. Really liked how this was handled, even if it is a bit far fetched and doesn't make a ton of sense how Thanos got to the future.Part 3:
Here's where the film gets sloppy and makes poor choices. Hulk snaps his fingers, Thanos arrives, and we get the cool action scene of our original 3 heroes vs Thanos. Cap becomes worthy and gets the hammer (and...can also summon lightening?), but still gets his ass kicked. All good stuff.And then...Sigh.The ""epic"" ending to this film is the equivalent of an 11 year old dumping 3 bins of Marvel action figures onto the floor and playing with them for what seems like 9 hours. I didn't mind what some people lament as ""fan service"" up until this point, because we were focused on a few characters we really care about, that have been with us for about a decade.So many characters do so many things that I stopped caring, when the previous fight between Captain America, Iron Man and Thor vs Thanos was so much better. Go back to that! But you know, instead they have to cram every single character into this scene - including Pepper Pots in an Iron Man suit. Captain ""Cheat Codes"" Marvel comes in and does her thing. Spiderman activates ""instant kill."" Dr. Strange stops a flood or something.My mind starts wandering and I think ""what is the point of the Space Stone if every wizard can open portals between worlds?"" And ""where were half these people in the last movie?"" And ""is Pepper in the Iron Man suit just so the scene with all the women looks more full, especially since they killed off the main one I care about?"" And ""why isn't anyone saying 'Hulk, wtf do you mean we have to return these stones?!?!?!'""Tony's death is unfortunately so predictable and crammed into this mess that it doesn't register as strongly as it should. Intimate fight scenes, like in the end of Civil War or Black Panther, are always much better than massive battle scenes. At the least, you need to separate the two.What should've happened is Tony and Cap decide to take the Gauntlet as far away as possible from the battle. Thor and Hulk try to hold off Thanos. Hulk succeeds in holding off Thanos long enough for them to escape, redeeming himself from his last fight with Thanos. But Thanos manages to catch up with Tony and Cap. They fight him, but Thanos is clearly too powerful. Realizing they can't beat Thanos, Cap puts on the Gauntlet and sacrifices himself (yes - Cap should've died, not Tony). This way, even if there is a still massive CGI fest for the kids, at least there's this more intimate battle between our main characters. That's why Infinity Wars worked so well IMO. You had the big battle in Wakanda, and the more intimate fight with Thanos.The very end is pure schmaltz. I'm not sure what went on with Cap - if that's a contradiction to how time travel works, or for some reason he was beamed back outside the portal? Either way, didn't like it.If they put the Stones back in the other universes, aren't there still no stones in theirs, meaning their universe is threatened by all the dark forces or whatever? I think I would've just screwed over those other universes, but that's me.Wouldn't mind seeing a spinoff movie where Loki has the Space Stone."
1570,"No spoilers but it was hyped up too much, and a lot of things just felt off in this movie the jokes and circumstances. It's gonna be one of those films where you're gonna love or just feel eh"
1571,"Let's face it, the movie is good and entertaining, well made with a few holes. Currently the score is that high ( more than 9) due to the hype, but the real score is around 7.I was expecting more dramatic ending and more deaths to be honest, but Marvel are too kind, so they would never do that.There were a few holes, like how the f did they discover the time travel within a few minutes? Something so complicated and impossible was discovered within a few minutes movie time. They should have spent more time on that.Thor was funny indeed but they really ruined the character, made him a monkey-like troll.A big ship was teleported and broke the entire building's ceiling , but nobody heard that? What?There are other details that were neglected, but I am not Rotten Tomatoe , I won't bash on the movie just because of a few things.As I said , the movie is well-made, good, entertaining, enjoy it.My score : 7/10"
1572,"My First movie review ever and thats because I love Marvel absolutely love it to core and the expectations I had from this movie were just way too much, and after watching I am so disappointed.
Infinity wars was just so much better, End Game has way too many plot holes and some very lazy writing.
I wish I liked it after such a long wait but unfortunately I just couldnt"
1573,"The movie is not very good, special effects at the limit of viewable, iron girl and hulk that are really horrible at timesAn actor's mess misorder throughout the film, script facilities or the fact that the film does not even respect the rules he may have laid on his world, the script is extremely predictable, the jokes are not very funny, thor will still remain a nice surprise, but unfortunately no one in the room could take him seriously afterwards for more serious scenes, people began to laugh during sad scenes or wanted serious scenes.Captain marvel is unbearable and is only there to serve as a deus ex machina, or a ridiculous feminist scenes that cut in the middle of an action scene, really misplaced, even seems like the scene was shot after the fact.Characters who literally have 5min of screentime.And the end fight, the end fight is so much of a disappointment, can you imagine an incredible scene that will decide the fate of the earth?No just a scene trying to put as much marvel characters possible on screen and 90% of the time you'll just see them running.The movie clearly doesn't deserve 9 out of 10 and 3 hours to tell its story? Infinity war had surprised me despite some mistakes that can be found on this one, but endgame is even less well written and ordered than infinity war.Anyway, if this movie should end this rather average movie series, well, it will end up on a bad note."
1574,It's good I really do think that it's good but people over huped it
1575,"It was absolutely terrible. Thor beat thanos when thanos had all the infinity stones, so when they fight again without the infinity stones thor alone should be able to beat him, specially that he has STONE BREAKER and his old hammer, plus he is full of rage and anger which apparently makes him even mightier. Iron man as well fought againt thanos with infinite stones and actually gave him a good fight, yet when he doesnt have them he can barely win, iron man is much stronger than that. Dr.strange as well gave him a great fight last time, why was he just wasting time. Why was captin marvel didn't contribute. The list goes on of messed up parts, in my opinion stonebreaker was the strongest weapon ever made, and it was equivalent to the infinity stones power almost, why didnt thor just take thanos out. As a marvel fan am highly disappointed."
1576,"Where Avengers 3 excelled in action, this one excels in boredom.
The two are like day and night, the Ying and Yang of movies.Infinity Wars:15 minutes of talk, the rest action.
Endgame: 15 minutes of action the rest talk and selfpitty.See this because you have to, not because of the inflated ratings.Avengers 3: 10/10
Avengers 4: 4/10"
1577,"A a stand off movie this one would have been a average one time watch with usual super hero stuff. But actually to conclude a franchise of this magnum, this is definitely not the way to do it. Maybe it because the crew and the directors got too much on their plate to handle. Unlike the previous MCU movies this movie took on a near to impossible task of connecting the dots from all the 22 movies and then bring it to a conclusion, which unfortunately just didn't happen. I would say personally as a fan this was a great disappointment as none of my favorite characters got enough screen time which they deserve and also it was like a dump yard all those who went missing being dumped in one place and suddenly they do their thing and its all done. Come on man its Tony and the send off is totally not worth it. Thor, maybe in the beginning I find it funny but once the story progress it just didn't go with the kinda of personality as we know. Capt. Marvel don't even know why she is in the movie first place, it would've made no difference even without her. The solution to bring ppl back it just happened over night and it was not convincing at all, except it involved Tony. Same goes with Hulk, happened just like that. it was just too much mess and they didn't do enough to clean it up. Two parts is seriously inadequate, could've been a trilogy...."
1578,"I always thought it was going to be almost impossible to improve on Infinity War... and I think I've been proved right.
This was always going to be a film all about how the good guys could return to winning ways after getting their proverbial @as kicked in infinity war.
Yes we probably wanted to see some of the aftermath of half the universe being wiped out....but it didn't need to play out for so long.
To be honest I dislike most films when time travel becomes involved...I just think it all becomes a bit ""well nothing really matters as we'll just go back in time and change it"".
I've watched infinity war 8 times already... but i just can't imagine ever sitting through this that many times.
My honest opinion is it's too long....some of the main characters are just either disappointing or none existent.
Another issue..if you have a character as powerful as Captain Marvel the rest of the squad become a bit redundant...unless you a again decide to send her to the other side of the universe.
Some people will kid themselves that this is the peak of the whole journey.....its not...it already happened in infinity war."
1579,Disney is destroying MCU with this movie... story is not that good...very slow in the first 2 hours...and then 30mn if action very intense ending with the death of the main hero...wow...good job Disney.... Experts in how to kill what they were not the creator...same thing will happen with Star Wars...3 hours wasted.
1580,"But I can't really tell if that's a good thing or not.I appreciate that Marvel is trying something different with this movie, that they changed their working formular to create something new, but for me it sadly didn't work out.In comparison to Infinity War, Endgame is just.....nh. Disappointing.
If you've seen all the other MCU movies you might get a kick out of all the references and jokes based on those, that's the stuff I greatly enjoyed. Endgame didn't take itself and it's characters too seriously and at times this worked out really well. But regretfully, there are others parts where this change of plans destroyed the movie for me.
I don't know, turning Thor into an alcoholic, lazy dude who does nothing besides playing Fortnite (yes, Fortnite is in this movie) all day just isn't funny at all and ruins the hard work Taika Waititi has put into him. I also hate what they did to Hulk/Banner, I always thought Banner was an extremly likeable and interesting character, but in this movie I couldn't stand him.
Most of the other characters are just _fine_, Tony and Steve being the only ones who really stand out. Endgame gives either of those characters important decisions to make and their dynamic is absolutely entertaining.
Steve's ending though was just awful. Not only was it predictable ever since we knew time travel would be part of the plot, it wasn't satisfying at all. Steve leaving his two best friends behind, who he hadn't seen in f i v e years, just to hang with the girl he met for a few weeks eighty years ago AFTER he already made out with her niece is just unbearable. Awful. Why would you do that.I liked the ending they gave Tony, it was fitting for his character and regarding his importance for the whole MCU he deserved a big goodbye.
To be honest, I would've liked it more if they gave Steve the big, heroic death and let Tony live in retirement with his family but hey, whatever.So in conclusion, after first watching it I really expected more. This just wasn't the big ending I was promised, it was weird at times and overall fine at best. I don't think it was necessary to make it three hours long. The Russo Brothers directed all of my favourite MCU movies so far, but this one was a total miss.
Wouldn't recommend if you're not a fan."
1581,This movie is only made for Marvel fans. Not like the other 21 Marvel movies. They were entertaining every moviegoer.But Endgame will entertain especially Marvel fans.
1582,"I had a huge disappointment with this movie. I can't share the excitement for this Avengers movie. Sooo much hype and soo much people where excited to see this movie. The Cinema was sold out. But to be really honest it's just simply not worthy to be a Avengers movie. Really flat story and just disappointment how the characters evolved. Sadly that people just will see the ""good comments"" and ignore that this was one of the most disappointing movie ever...."
1583,"Of course it couldnt be as good as Infinity War. And to be fair it could be terrible, wich it isnt. But it is still not great in any way. 1 good joke and just a bunch of revisiting past episodes, thats it. Thats End Game. They sure leaned on tear jerking hard, and it did get me a little with Nebula reaching out. but overall it just shows that going into time travel paradoxes can be funny or stupid. And here it is second one i am afraid. Not a waste of time, but far from Infinity war. They would get so ,much respect if they actually ended it with IW))"
1584,"Marvel lost me in a suicide mission. The ending sucked big time, they ruined the hero's that made the marvel universe what it is.
Plot sucked, execution was boring, ending horrifying, And for no reason!!!
That's it no more marvel for me.
I AM DONE WITH THIS NONESENSE TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED."
1585,"Nearly 1000 reviews two days after the release, so you just need the basic information without spoilers.It's in my opinion the worst marvel movie I've seen and I've seen all except for the captian marvel movie. I loved the previous avengers movie, which I rated 8 out of 10. I was looking forward to the movie and got disappointed big time.Endgame is slow. I mean really slow. The first 2,5 h you barley see a action scene. It's full of plot holes, which make the movie unbelieveable. I know its fiction but that doesn't mean you can cut all the logic and get away with it. The plot itself was very predictable but there was not much plot left when you take the jokes and the fanservice away. The antagonist was reduced to the absolute minimum. Infinity War build Thanos as the best and complex villain in the MCU, just to turn him into a one dimensional world destroyer. They alter their characters in parodic ways. Some may find it funny but not me. The humor is also a big factor. Infinity War had funny moments but this was a absolute gatling gun fire of unnecessary jokes and none of them hit. The jokes were overdone and they rode the dead horse many times which lead me to hide my face behind my hands for most of the time. Maybe it's just not my kind of humor.Sooooo...3h of my lifetime I can't get back. It felt wasted. I was bored, angry and torn between sleeping in the chair or just walking out the cinema."
1586,"What a boring long movie.
OK special effects are great. But the story line is boring. Nothing happens in first 90 minutes. The rest of the movie is a lot of fuss about some stones. Boooooooooring! I was happy the long sit was over.
I read the reviews here and I honestly do not understand why people are so enthusiastic about this movie."
1587,"I wanted to see a MCU movie not a comedy movie with a lot of motivational speech. At one point it seemed they just wanted to make a competition of motivational speeches. The worst movie of the whole MCU saga. It really did ended my whole interest with superhero movies, such an endgame for me. Don't loose your precious time by watching this boring motivational comedy movie without any surprises."
1588,"Could have done lot better
It was a movie of hulk , cap and iron man talking a loooooooooot and just talking"
1589,"Good god what were the writers thinking. back to the future meets avengers?
they made it so advanced that the story is hard to follow. they were only going for jokes. like hulk running down stairs saying "" so many stairs "" why the heck would Hulk run down the stairs? they were going for cheap laughs. nothing more.
they just cant hack out a good story."
1590,So unfair to the Thor's character. I felt the character was totally treated bad. Even the Hulk's character was wasted.
1591,"Jar Jar deserves an oscar compared to her. Her presence on screen makes you want to walk out. Not to mention the film is already filled to the brim with unncessary huge number of ""strong"" female characters to the point its absurd. And not cool, awesome strong female characters like Rene Russo's character, whom you believe is a bada5s and has depth.
So female Jar Jar aside (an insult to Jar Jar actually), the movie, the first half, is pretty darn good, with many great comical moments especially. Second half and especially the last third, it slows down and starts becoming the formulaic and typical hollywood film, full of empty fighting, streched out beyond all sensible constraints. The ending is also not very insipiring or clever.
Also at times it suffers from some quite bad writing. Like when Thor presents Valkyrie with Asgard as if it is this great gift to her. Remember Asgard, a majestic, wonderful city on a half waterfall, half clouds, with a rainbow and beautiful weather every day.
Asgard,that is NOW a small sh1thole of a fishing village, cold and damp 11 months out of the year, with pollution and just an overall miserable life. Who the F would want to be a queen of that ?
Anyway I dont see why it has such a high score, it definitely doesnt deserve it. Its not bad but its nothing special either with too many noticeable distractions that annoy you."
1592,"Excellent hype for non Marvel fans, the plot just develops too slowly for those who have actually been following the entire sage. Flat performances by all actors, Antman being the stand out this time around. Expected a huge gripping finale but was presented with an overly confident view on everything and no suspense whatsoever. Chuckled a coupe of times but couldn't wait to leave the cinema. Will
wait for the next Installment....."
1593,This movie was complicated and weird. The child friendly Barney/Thanos started attacking random hero's like iron man and other people. I found this very odd because Barney teaches us to have fun but he is ending other people's fun. This was complicated because they kept on referring to Barney as Thanos which made it difficult to understand what was happening.
1594,"The Black Widow movie is cancelledCaptain Marvel was written out, does nothing in this filmCaptain America is gay? I'm not sure about that scenethe asgardians have no reason to be revivedthere is no time travel. They visit a paralel universe."
1595,In marvel they can kill entire world with fingersnipping but in reality entire world don't know marvel. Film is too long to cover all stories background which needs knowledge of all films. But I don't know why sudden feminism. Marvel newbies find it very odd and boring and even end fight is not as great as promised and praised by few. Maybe marvel iron fans will love this but this film is not for all. It is meant and made for marvel fans and for their appreciation in which endgame succeeds
1596,I didn't like being disappointed by it but it didn't do all the years of build up and the characters justice. It has good comedy but ultimately felt like a lacklustre way to end things. Less of an Endgame more of just an ending.
1597,"I think what going on with the high score and usually it settles down a little bit lower as time goes on. But I think we're seeing what happen when the dark Knight came out. A ton of people were voting perfect or near perfect scores for the dark Knight so it could overtake the godfather.when they hadn't even seen it I think that's what's going on here yesterday there wasn't even 1000 votes at 11:30 Eastern time there's almost 11,000 votes what I mean votes are from 1 to 10 stars. I thought IMDB fix this problem but apparently not now the average matrix score is 78 that's what they should really go by now course on the worst site ever rotten tomatoes is that a 97 but the most important part is that almost 8.3 is the average score of the people they gave it a fresh review. Rotten tomato will take anybody that will review they don't care if you're a real film critic or not"
1598,"I have been watching most marvel movies since when iron man 2 came out , seen em all except hulk , but after watching this I finally had a horrible realisation : I have never felt anything while watching them , other than a few cheap laughs and some impressive action they really don't have much to offer .Why did watch them , this one didn't feel like a waste of time but it didn't feel I a use of my time either *sigh* why , what have i been doing"
1599,"A great ending, to a much loved saga. It would have been very easy for Marvel to mess this one up, but it delivered in all aspects."
1600,"Let me start by saying THIS is how you wrap a saga!!!!
I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee."
1601,Very hardwork nd very nice movie nd so smart tony stark
1602,"Pretty much 90% of the user reviews already say what I want to say so I'll keep it short. This movie was so much worse, in every way, than Infinity War. Which is a shame and it's not gonna get a low score because of how overrated it is, even though most people leave reviews saying how much they hated it. It just sucks that THIS is the ending to the decade long series we all grew up with."
1603,"I have several good reasons why i believe that Marvel made a big mistake...1) In 2012, Loki stole the tesseract. 1 minute later, the Ancient One tells that all the stones have to be returned to the exact place and time. Loki stole the space stone in 2012... Alternative time has been created here at their own universe in 2012. It does not have affect on the future avengers' universe, but for this one in 2012 yes....2) How could Rogers use the lighting? In Thor 3, Odin said to Thor, that the hammer is just to help you concentrate, you have the power. Rogers should not have used the lighting as it is not the hammer which gives the power.... Anyway, the moment was fantastic when Rogers became worthy after what happened in Cap America 3 :)3) How could Thanos came thru the hole with his ship? The key was Stark's machine on their hand to navigate in time finding the proper way to the proper time. Thanos did not have such navigator to find the proper way of time in the hole because the one that 2012 Nebula had, she used to came back with the other avengers to open the hole for Thanos.And those worries are logic related. And i did not tell anything about the ""easy"" solutions such as the rat who accidentally push the exact button which brought back Ant-man and nothing about the ""easy"" jokes which could not correctly balanced out the basic depressing feeling of the movie. The depressing feeling was very good, but the jokes are not ""worthy"" :)"
1604,After watching Infinity War I was expecting another action-packed blockbuster. Instead it was mostly a snoozefest as they tried to get everything organized for the not-so-grand finale. When it finally did get to the finale it wasn't worth the wait. If you judge it by money made it was a huge success but as a movie it was a big letdown from Infinity War.
1605,"It's down on my list of best marvel movies, I just don't feel like watching it again. Honestly, as well, if I hadn't seen it, and Infinity War was the final of the series, I might be happier with that. That said, this film is more entertaining than sitting in a dark room doing nothing, and it does actually conclude the Avengers storyline, it doesn't conclude in a great way, but it concludes.
I feel that Marvel movies have suffered since the loss of Stan Lee, and have certainly lost their neutral integrity, allowing certain political ideologies to take priority on screen, at points, over internal logic or entertainment value."
1606,Woooooooooooooow..... what did I just watched.... I was sad and happy in the same time. I really enjoyed watching it.... EPIC
1607,"This movie can actually be named as ""best movie ever"". MCU has started 11 years ago, and every movie they did before, all this work was wasted for this incredible moment - finish a work they have been done. Every ppl have to watch it, cause anyone can just try, to describe that fantastic movie."
1608,"Awesome thriller and drama,with comedy,sadness. I watch it three times and will buy on blue ray disc. I can't wait for more story continues on phrase 4."
1609,"I am not a Marvel fans so I hadn't seen many marvel movies so far . I think a good movie
especially such magnitude like avenger 4 should let most people can understand content even I didn't see other marvel movies before. As a non marvel fans moviegoer , avenger 4 is not a good movie for the audiences like me . So that why I think this movie has wild room to improve because I still think audiences like me are not the minority"
1610,"Disney has done so well in the past making movies. Using time travel seemed like an easy way out. When Paul Rudd says they only have enough of the juice for the round trip, it is hard not to think of the lazy writing lines in Deadpool 2 when Cable says the same thing. Every moment in the movie that is suppose to be emotional is ruined by the simple fact that it makes no sense how they arrived to it in the first place. In all, stay for the action and ignore the story."
1611,"The movie was ok, not willing to watch the 2nd time"
1612,"2 1/2 hours of drama 30 min of action
Best part when hammer man tells captain America you keep the small one"
1613,"I'm a little disappointed with this movie, the grand finale was not so great for me. Maybe i'm little tired about superheroes movies. Infinity War was way better than this.
I never was a big fan of Captain America or Iron Man. The first is the most boring character of the franchise, so good, so flat; the second, so hyperventilated that is exhausting to see. There's no Thor or Hulk in this one, only a pathetic versions of the great characters they are. Is not a bad movie either, thanx to Ant Man, Black Widow, Spiderman, Hawkeye, Rocket Racoon. The rest of the heroes only are cameos or just ornaments. The battle scenes not bad, but not the best. (Sorry for my english). 6/10"
1614,"Not going to go into any spoilers I just felt that overall the movie was average, it did a lot of things right and a lot of things wrong. The acting was decent, the action scenes were good if few and short and the pacing wasn't atrocious.But there were flaws, Brie Larson could have been replaced by a cardboard cut out, some of the twists made little sense and the big fight was rather unsatisfying and had a really cringy scene (you'll know it when you see it)Ultimately it's worth watching but the people rating this a 10 are overly hyped or wearing blinders because there were more than enough flaws evident throughout the movie. Basically go in expecting an alright action flick and you'll enjoy it."
1615,"Avengers Endgame is a movie I've been excited for since the end of Infinty War. I purposefully avoided any and all information about the movie, to allow myself to see it without any clear ideas of what to expect. However, while I was surprised, it wasn't of the pleasant variety. Unfortunately there seems to have been some kind of oversight with the writing of one character in particular, which causes the whole movie to fall apart, both in terms and the story and emotional weight.Without getting into spoilers, Endgame introduces rules, and not only goes on to break those rules, but completely renders them meaningless to ensure the final set piece can take place. While it was previously mentioned in the movie that resources are limited, so they can only attempt their plan once, a character then goes on to show that they were apparently capable of doing what they were planning to do, seemingly all along. Whether this character knew that or not is up for debate, but it was incredibly distracting and lowered the overall emotional weight and tension.This character, for forever reason, also doesn't reveal important information, which only serves to progress the plot. This then leads to the previously mentioned action that completely ignores all the stakes set in place, leaving those in the audience with their brain turned on feeling annoyed.Endgame attempts to build an emotional story, but due to the ability the previously mentioned character is shown to have, all emotional weight is completely lost. While this movie may have brought tears to the eyes of many, it simply left mine rolling.Endgame also has a 3 hour runtime, and for at least 2 of those hours you can feel every minute of it. It also doesn't do a great job of juggling all of the talent as a large number of characters server more of a cameo role than anything else. However, the main cast do a fantastic job from start to finish. These talented men and women understand and portray their characters so well, it's easy to forget one is watching actors at all. If I had to praise one aspect of this film it would be the performances.While the final battle is interesting, in concept it also raises its share of questions, regarding the power levels of certain characters. While most may be able to overlook these, anyone who has been paying attention well enough will start to wonder if the writers even watched the previous film.Furthermore, the story of Thanos in this film completely undermines the spectacular work the previous film did, both by the writers and Josh Brolin. This changes Thanos from one of the most compelling and three dimensional antagonists in modern cinema to a big purple CGI monster who wants to destroy the world.It may sound like I hated this film, but I do recommend that every fan of the MCU see it, as it does wrap everything up, so long as you don't think about it too hard."
1616,"It was just.. wasn't for me I guess? Avengers: Endgame is an epic tale of a closing chapter in the Marvel universe, presented as a serious movie with Marvel puns, gags and CGI heavy battles. The film tries to reinforce the fact, that what happend in IW is serious and the 3 hour long screen time makes you wander: Is this good or bad? 1 hour or so is about bragging about what happend at the end of the Infinity War, superheroes whining about their existence like ""we shouuuuuuuld doooo somethiiiiing"" but nothing happens for most of the part. I tried to like it, really but as a comic book movie, it was just pure fan service and good CGI with a lot of pointless scenes where everything is too explained. What I would like to point out that, IW was much better. It was a comic book movie, tried to be what it is and at the end it turned out to be much more. This, feels like the opposite. This film wants to be the ""much more"" part and at the end, it remembers that it is a comic book movie. There was a grand battle at this movie which reminded me to Anchorman where everyone from everywhere comes to battle along the heroes. It was so.... not serious at all? I don't know...If you are a Marvel fan, go out and watch it. You will have fun 100%. Anyone else, just try to like it, like I did..."
1617,"This is my own opinion, but so many things that didn't make sense in that movie... like so much stuff that could've been utilised in a better way and so many stupid things that were put on wrong hands. The image and the graphics are really good but the plot is weak.
Emotionally I give a 9/10
Graphics I give a 9/10
Storyline I give a 3/10"
1618,"The conclusion of phase 1 is a good movie, yet, lacks what Infinity War presented. The first flaw in the movie was the strange effort to make Thor a comedic relief. Thor has been able to persevere through the deaths of all of his family and best friend in prior movies, yet, now, he hits bottom because Thanos won and he now has a chance to defeat him and undo what Thanos accomplished, yet, he remains a fat depresso? A better play would have been for Thor to return to full strength and join the battle a ripped warrior, not a fat Lebowski. The second mistake in Endgame was not making the angry Hulk come out in the end of the movie to battle with the original Avengers against Thanos. The third mistake was why did the film focus so much on the lamest Avenger, Legolas? No one cares about the arrow shooter, come on man. The fourth mistake was making Thanos too weak without the stones. Thanos was an ultimate conqueror in Infinity War, why was he battling alone so much against the Avengers without a more intelligent battle scheme with his Order. Lastly, unless Downey Jr and Evans wanted to retire from their roles, why kill them off??? Downey Jr is the focal point of the MCU, why not keep him around for minor future roles? Plus, why not give the shield to Bucky, like the comics. Seems a little strange to deviate from the comics like that. Fifth, how Stark obtained the Guantlet was hard to see and understand, sloppy writing. Finally, why not have an end credit scene? We need a lead to phase 2? The good points are that the end battle was overall good, Stark saving the day and dying was shocking, and the scenes of going back in time, a la Back to the Future 2, was fun. Overall, the movie was a 7 out of 10, not as good as Infinity War, definitely not deserving of ranking higher than the best superhero movie of all time, the Dark Knight. Notably, I'm a huge Marvel fan."
1619,"Ever since Marvel aired the first Iron Man movie, they have been ahead in the game of superhero movies. They gave us characters we could believe in and grow to love. They showed us both the human and the hero and as audiences we started to invest in this whole franchise and their vision. Not every movie has been good or liked, but overall they were telling us a story that were leading to an end - the end that were to come in Endgame.When Infinity war aired , and we watched, we were left with sadness for the ones that were dusted and the loss that our heroes experienced. Thanos was shown as a villain but he managed to evoke sympathy in the viewer because of the loss he also experienced. Thus is was with great expectations that I went to see Endgame - for surely this was going to be huge and epic. In my first viewing, I was blown away by the emotions it managed to evoke and I thought it was great, but I walked out of the theater feeling a bit numb and reflecting back I realized why : Marvel gave us easy answers to very complex problems and questions. They went out and created a movie that paid off the fan but didn't satisfy the people that got really invested in the franchise. They made Thor a joke - Thor was epic in Ragnarok. The scene were he got his thunder is one of my favorites and even in Infinity war where he shows up is brilliant - yet here he isn't even fighting and he is a bum with jokes. To add to this, Hulk is once again played down and shown as nothing more than a bystander that doesn't even get to fight, let alone be angry.One of the strongest heroes in the universe does nothing other than pose for selfies, invents a machine and be a little ""sad"" for the sacrifice of Black Widow.
The gaping plot holes, the way they ""kill of"" Tony, Captain and Black Widow with so many unanswered questions, is sad. Captain America ""sacrifices "" himself to go put back the stones in their reality - but how does he do it? We all know the soul stone needs a sacrifice - how did he do that if he's all alone? How did he travel to all those places and do that to just then stay in the past and get his last dance with Peggy?
The final battle was messy and blah to be honest and way too short for such an ""epic"" film. I must admit, looking back now I realize I was already disappointed in the theater when every theory that has been speculated about came true in the movie. The Russos tried very hard to throw us of the scent by saying the trailers were not true or just promotional materials but it was a big let down when it turned out that most of the movie has been seen in the trailers and TV spots.
It's not a bad movie because it pays homage to its fans, but in my opinion it almost feels like they listened to those fans way to much instead of just writing it in a way that would have made more sense and maybe leave us more satisfied. I don't know what their plans are in the next phase - if we will see an Avengers movie again, but Endgame, although not bad didn't really give me the ending I was hoping for."
1620,"They tried to touch every aspect of Marvel universe in the movie, which resulted very very limited time for each of them. This made the movie very complicated, hard to follow, boring and you can not get into the movie.No great fight scenes,
No extra and creative story,
No moments to remember"
1621,"But its a pretty good film. A bit of a mess in some parts, lacking the cohesive and effortless feel infinity war somehow managed to accomplish. Some silly plot holes and characters that could've been cut (Ahem, captain marvel and thanos). The use of Captain marvel in this film was just ridiculous. Shes there at the start, bails for some reason? And then pops up at the end to serve no purpose but deux ex machina a space ship...The past thanos part wasn't necessary when you think about it, they could've done this film without a real 'villain' And it would've worked and been a original take on a super hero film without using the same formula we have seen in 10+ super hero films already. The entire final battle felt like a rehashed messy battle, with a bunch more characters against thanos - basically mixing the space battle from infinity war; iron man, spider man etc and the final battle of infinity war with captain america, thor etc.. mashing those two into one within this new film. The scenes of trying to pull the gauntlet off his hand.. it all felt like a rehash.To me the best part of the film was the first act and half of the second, when everyone is lost and trying to figure out how to continue on. really interesting themes that followed the pay off from infinity wars ending. And then the time heist part. Tho the heist part should've been much more stretched out. With only small parts of thanos within that, and not having him be the big bad again. But just a side character that gets in the way a little bit.And the setting up for 'new avengers' to replace the beloved actors and characters we have come to associate with these films.. they do not get me at all excited for the next phase in marvel films. Falcon, Valkyrie, blackpanther, cap marvel? I just dont care about them at all. And their actors lack any charisma or depth.To me this feels like a closing of marvel films that I'll really enjoy for my pop corn fix. I've given infinity war a 10/10 and some of the stand alone films 8's and 9's. But I have a sinking feeling this will not be happening in the future except the guardians of the galaxy films.It seems i maybe in the minority for my feelings towards this film, but im not sugar coating my opinion like it seems a few people are doing due to nostalgia. Its good, but not great. Had the opportunity to be better, maybe? And the setting up of new characters to come possible reflects on my score to... Because i just don't give two cents about any of them"
1622,"Believe me I wanted to love this movie. But its very ""Dull"" slow and Lengthy .It was pointless to make 2 films, They are just fooling audience and fans. And audience are falling for traps.Every situation is so predictable that it gets you out of the movie. This level of ""nothing new"" is damaging to the story as it stops you from caring about anything."
1623,"This movie had a really slow pace before moving into action.. First 1,5 hours there's nothing exciting happening... Thank God the movie had a beautiful ending with respect for all characters.Warning the next section contains spoilers...:First act is about everybody mouring over the loss of people cause the snap. No action at all and it looks like a drama movie here. Really boring in fact.The second act is the time travelling thing, also no action in here but a lot of funny moments though. Everyone in the theatre was laughing multiple times.There's only action during the third act.. Great action scenes and surprises here. But sometimes it felt like it was a little bit rushed. Thanos is also extremely (unrealistically?) powerful without the gountlet. Not a lot of screenplay for the children of Thanos. I think they could have done more with the Maw for example.If you compare the action of infinity war to this one, it looks like there wasn't enough money left for it... Maybe most of the money went to ALL the actors within MCU for reappearing all again in this movie for a couple of minutes?"
1624,I was super excited to see this movie after Infinity War ended but I left rather disappointed. It was good but I felt like the first hour or so was wasted space. I did love Thor though.
1625,If I were to see this movie in theaters again I'd have to buy 2 tickets. One for me and one for the person pointing the gun at my head.Another super hero movie. I'd give it a 0 but I can't.
1626,"All the people who have given a rating of 10 to this movie, I would ask IMDB to review if these are fake accounts. I know it's not a rating on 1/10 but then I had to balance the odds. There was simply no real wow moment (except for 1-2 minutes in the end). Week logic, poor surprise element, character mismanagement, sexist/feminist scenes, are some of the many flaws in the story line.
The directs blew it big time..."
1627,"I love superheroes. I was raised reading comic books. I watched every film since the first Iron Man. I know when the MCU gets something right. And in this film, they got some things right, and some things wrong.Don't get me wrong, this film is a spectacle. But so was Infinity War. And because Infinity War came first, it was more spectacular. It doesn't matter if you increase your numbers, at least not to the crowd I was watching it with, because we didn't have those instinct reactions I lived through and enjoyed when watching Infinity War for the first time.There's a simple explanation for that. Whenever I, as an audience member, stop and think to myself ""that doesn't look/sound right"" I lose my engagement to what's happening on screen.The truth is, you need a strong story to get the crowds to an emotional high, to remain engaged. This film did not have a strong story. The plot had lots of holes, like all films that involve time travel, and while I appreciated the character moments, it did have huge spaces where I simply lost interest. It also contradicted itself, as well as previous films, in order to serve the existing plot, which means I got to roll my eyes a lot whenever the writers were pulling stuff out of their little clown hat. All that really gets one out of the film watching experience.Also, for the first time in the MCU, there were moments when I felt the actors were not even acting. Some of the character story lines were so ill-developed that even the acting was off, especially for Cap. I was looking at Chris Evans, and seeing Chris Evans and not Steve Rogers in many occasions. I don't even blame the guy, the script he was handed was a mess.For those who don't believe me, that the writers did a sloppy job, I will give you an example. When Natasha dies, they try to pull at our heartstrings by mentioning her family. Her father's name. Ivan. Only, that's not her father's name. We know her name, it's Natalia Alianovna Romanova. Russians take the middle name from their fathers. Alianovna literally means daughter of Alian. They wrote a main character death and yet they didn't have the decency to research enough to get her name right.Anyway, I know it doesn't matter what I think. I know it doesn't matter what any of us thinks because at this point, put the Marvel logo on anything and it will sell. Which is why the writers care less and less about their stories. I'm not saying don't go to see it, I'm saying don't expect too much."
1628,Believe me when i tell you that this movie was no where near infinity war...i was so disappointed from this Movie...They destroyed Thor showed cap can wield thors hammer and make lighting?come on mavel wtf...Banner is no more hulk just banner.It had some good moments but overall it wasn't great at all.And i was so waiting much for this after infinity...
1629,Infinity war still better. Too many holes to go over. I love the MCU but this missed the mark in my opinion. I would watch infinity war over this hands down.
1630,Literally might be the dumbest movie I've ever seen. Thanos dies in the first five minutes of the movie. They fill the rest of the movie with flashbacks from the other Avenger movies. It's all recycled material and the whole production probably took five minutes.
1631,Just watch this epic final of the best Marvel movie ever!
1632,"Despite what others may say or have said this film was far from predictable. I certainly lost my bets. I both laughed and cried during this film.
I loved every minute and none of those minutes were wasted. The writers outdid themselves on this one. I just hope the next ten years can live up to the first.
Here's hoping."
1633,"Just a first impression. Minor spoilers only; not going to say who lives and who dies, though I will give a plot point or two away, so don't read on if you haven't seen it yet.I'm a big fan of Marvel's movies, so don't think I am trolling. My honest opinion is that the movie is fun, has a three hour running time that doesn't feel overlong, but doesn't really do anything we haven't seen before, in the way Infinity War did. It lacks something and does a diservice to some of the characters by making them comic buffoons.Time Travel? Really? More End Lame than End Game. At one point some of central characters reel-off time-travel movies, and they don't really come up with any variation on the standard cliches involving such movies. The redo of previous movies is enjoyable but hardly brilliant.Really like Chris Hemsworth as Thor. The writers have turned him into a joke here. Not the actor's fault, he does a fine job, as do all and sundry with what they are given. I didn't buy what they did to Hawkeye at all. The Hulk has done nothing over two huge movies. He was ruined, too. Some of the film is much too broad in its humour.So does this mean the the events of Winter Soldier and Civil War plus all the previous Avengers' movies didn't happen? Trying not to give anything away but parts of this fall into X-Men Days of Future Past territory. Or Deadpool 2. It's confusing and it feels like a rip-off. Cosmic Marvel seems to have taken over everything, and the more grounded movies feel like a thing of the past.I will have to see this again before I give my final opinon. At present I feel a bit disappointed. Much of the movie is fine; the ending is a retcon., like Brand New Day in the comics. And I hate retcons. The central theme just didn't grab me. All in all, Infinity War, Winter Soldier, Iron Man and the original Avengers film were much better for me."
1634,"The best marvel movie ever, I cannot put into words how amazing this movie was, too good!"
1635,"For many of the Marvel's fans, this will disappoint you. Let me tell you why.
The movie's lengh is overextended with too many scenes taking more time than they deserve.
The fight/ war scenes should have been more than this giving that this is the finale.
The final battle were done under poor lighting and i expected much more visual effects, the last movie final battle were conducted in so many better ways. The detailing of the battle became so pathetic with people chasing a start's arm with the stones on them.
The final battle's logic which allowed stark to finish everything is really unexplained, a man who posses the power of a god can't save his own life after wanting so much to be there for his daughter.
The concept and the handling of fhe time travel was poorly excuted.
The way captain america appeared in the final scene and the explanation of how he did so is childish.
The hulk role was so much dominished.
Fury had nothing to do with this film, just an appearance in the final scene.
Captain marvel's presence is truly sarcasitc, she appears at weird times and the justification fot this is funny.
Thor became a comic role in this movie, no what so ever strength in his character not even in the final scenes.
Dr strange role was dimished also, he is supposed to be one of the best avengers.
Again the final battle really failed to impress me, which is one of the main reseaons for disappointments.
The emotional scenes in the movie were scattered and undefined, this is sad giving the fact that the movie had all the elements required to deliver great emotional scenes where you can see each character's emotioned in a much clearer display.
I expected an epic film, a solid plot and a flying emotions, this movie didn't deliver any of those to me."
1636,This is an average one time watch.Not at all matching the hype caused due to tremendous success of it's predecessor movies.Average script and below par action sequences.You are better off rewatching GOT.A lot left to be desired out of this.
1637,"Thanos is way too strong without the infinity stones. Iron Man, Thor and Captain America together lose against him and not even Captain Marvel gets him (just after destroying a super-size starship with one blow). I just can't take this seriously - it doesn't fit into the Marvel-Universe.Furthermore, as a Thor fan I didn't like Captain America throwing around lightning with Mjolnir at all. Thor looked like a sidekick - what a shame. I would have expected a revive of Thor during the film and a demonstration of power towards the end. And Hulk, where was Hulk? No smashing of armies and no revenge against Thanos to make up for the last defeat.The expectations where just way too high..."
1638,"The visual effects are spot on, as usually.
The 6/10 ranking has to due with Captain America ending.He ended up with Peggy, meaning he did not grow at all. He was still stuck in the past and life is about dealing with new circumstances and understand some doors are closed forever. Not only that, Peggy's story as a brave independent woman who fought for a better world loses some meaning.
It is also hard to believe Steve Rogers would stay quiet during 70+ years whilst Peggy would do the hard work.
Steve Rogers's ending is lazy, incoherent and cliche.Black Widow dies, sacrificing herself, meaning any solo movie with her is meaningless. Her death as some sense, but it still feels empty.Tony Stark also dies, after having a happy ending (at the beginning of the movie). I believe this death is going to be divisive.The loopholes with time travel are there (how does Peter resume his life with the same colleagues?) and are kinda disappointing the more you think about them.Marvel really went for the pockets of the consumers and didn't put in the effort to tide things up orderly."
1639,"SPOILERS!!!Rubbish! They lost the logic track of time travel, forgot about Vision, killed 2 of the best characters of the Marvel univers and replaced another.
Idiotic! All masked with a great CGI, I admit that was well done.
You can't kill Iron Man just to give way to Iron Woman, why kill Iron Man, man? From all the character to kill you choose 2 that actually can inspire people.
Black Widow was a great character too, she was keeping the avenger together! Although I think Thor can bring her back. Hope so.So, Falcon is now Capitan America? HAHA! For real?One more thing ... Capitan America can use Thor hammer? What the hell was that about?"
1640,"""Avengers: Endgame"" is a new American movie from 2019 and well do I really need to say a lot about the basics here? Maybe only a little bit as absolutely everybody should know by now who the Avengers are. I believe it is essential that you have seen the previous Avengers movie from 2018 in order to appreciate this one here. But you don't need to have seen everything before that from the Avengers universe by any means in order to understand this one here. Directors Russo and Russo are back and they also got their screen writers on board again here, but this is really not a surprise and accurate as this is basically a duology. Also despite the ending from the previous Avengers film, all the actors are back and with that I really do mean ""all"", even some that did not show up in the last Avengers movie, but in previous films from the universe. Michael Douglas and Michelle Pfeiffer would be the best example, even if all of these really only have very brief screen time. And what was with that Robert Redford inclusion? Now that did feel a bit bizarre. Anyway, in this 3-hour(!) film the remaining Avengers are faced with the big challenge to find a way to turn things right again and when the option of time travel arises, this seems to be their only chance. Sadly, Thanos, the titan and main antagonist, who managed to erase half the universe in the previous film, finds out about the remaining Avengers' plans. It will be a tough battle. But one when there are new heroes on the horizon offering hope such as Captain Marvel Carol Danvers who just got her own movie not too long ago. That one featured a great deal of Samuel L. Jackson, who is almost unseen in this one here. But I mentioned Thanos already and would like to say a few more words about him now. I really loved him in the 2018 film, but in this one here, he was a bit underwhelming. I understand he is weakened because he destroyed the stones not too long ago and also does not really care too much because his mission is complete, but still the way we see him basically fight all Avengers at the very same time in the previous movie and here Captain Marvel alone can almost keep him under control at his neck. Or Thor out of nowhere severes his head. It just felt a bit too easy for me honestly. Now that I mentioned Thor here, he is in it pretty much for the comedy only this time as he has turned into quite a bum over the years when everybody is clueless how to bring the lost souls and friends back. And there are many other comedy-themed moments in here. You will laugh, but you will also be sad on some occasions. I will go into further detail about that statement in the next paragraph, so if you want to avoid in-depth spoilers, then now is the time to stop reading.I personally was more shocked by the death of Black Widow than by the death of Iron Man, perhaps because I have never been a huge RDJ fan in this franchise, even if I don't mind him either. And well, Scar-Jo plays in some films I quite adore, so it was sad to see her go, also because the build-up was very strong and you never knew if it was her or Jeremy Renner's character who would die. I like him too, so a loss-loss for me. Oh well I read Black Widow will get her own film soon, so I am curious how that turns out. 100% I'm gonna watch it. And at the end, when we find out about Captain America's personal decision how to spend the rest of his life, it was a bit sad and touching too, even if I think I read that Evans is finished with the franchise after this film. We'll see how his replacement does. I have a bit of a feeling by now they are really trying too hard to get African American actors in here for the sake of it. But maybe he can prove me wrong and he is actually good. Another scene I did not like very much was the female-power-centered one when we see virtually all female characters line up all of a sudden. That did feel cringeworthy and just for the sake of pleasing liberal Hollywood. But yeah, there were many really good moments that quickly make me forget about these, so it is all good. There were great moments without a doubt and I think the Avengers universe keeps going in style. But you should not expect this film to be as good as the last. I think it stays lower quality-wise. Stan Lee's final brief cameo was also rather underwhelming. May he rest in peace. Okay finally, the closing credits were kinda special this time because we also see the protagonists in a unique way and do not get the usual epilogue scene with indications to the next movie, but it makes sense as of course there is definite closure in this movie here and the Russos most likely won't return or if they will, they have no ideas yet what will come up next. It must be special to top Thanos and these two films for sure though. But yeah, the universe is restored, half of the civilization erased is back and Thanos is defeated, so time to take a breath for a little while. And pay attention to how it is those who survived the cleansing (Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America) who are eventually those who can be called fallen, well CA only to some extent. I think it is not necessary to give you a recommendation here as you probably know very well how much you like superhero films. The one thing I think is essential though is that you must absolutely watch the 2018 film before seeing this one and then you can decide for yourself if you want to sit through another 3 hours on the subject or accept evil being victorious. Make the right choice for yourself. I give Avengers: Endgame a thumbs-up, but not a too enthusiastic one as before."
1641,"After the last movie, I thought this was going to be awesome, instead, it was a time travel mess. If you take the actors that built this franchise out of the movie, this one is bad. Because we've got to watch these actors for the last 10-11 years, it was ok. I think the story was bad, and was a horrible way to end it all. It will break records I'm sure, but it's the only Marvel movie I'll watch only once. Super disappointed."
1642,"To clarify, I am not an MCU fangirl. I enjoy these movies a little more than the casual moviegoer but I definitely do not fit into the diehard category. I enjoy watching most of the films, but would only list the GOTG movies and THOR: RAGNAROK as personal favorites.So just know, this isn't coming from the perspective of some unpleasable geek. It's coming from someone who was emotionally invested in these movies, enjoys most of them, and prizes solid storytelling.And let me tell you, as a story, ENDGAME is a mess.Character development? Forget it! Thor's arc from selfish braggart to responsible king is thrown away so he can be Lebowski 2.0, complete with sunglasses and sweater. The Hulk and Peter Quill are pretty much jokes. Tony Stark gets one of the cheapest deaths in modern cinema-- it feels less like a natural culmination of the character's growth and more like RDJ wanted to make sure he wasn't shoehorned into more movies through 2050.And don't get me started on how the events of this film are going to wreck GOTG 3. Let's just say all Gamora's character development is in the trash now. I know plenty of people who love the GOTG movies but have no interest in any other Marvel property and they'll be confused as hell come 2021. (I really do not get people who claim these MCU films work as self-alone pictures. 9.5 times out of 10, they really don't at all.)ENDGAME continues the trend of CAPTAIN MARVEL in throwing continuity to the winds. What happened to Thor's hammer NOT being the source of his power? Now, Steve Rogers can use it to toss lighting everywhere like a rogue Pikachu. Peter Parker goes back to high school in 2023 and somehow Ned is still a teen attending--- even though he was one of the confirmed not-deaths after INFINITY WAR. Steve Roger's wild time travel ride at the end will also screw future timeline continuity up in ways I shudder to contemplate. I pity the screenwriters is all I gotta say.I won't say this movie is the worst. Compared to something like, say, THE LAST JEDI, which had the most formless, meandering plot, ENDGAME moves quickly and does not overstay its welcome. There are some truly fun fight scenes and one-liners. The final battle in particular is marvelous, giving me some of the most fun I've had in a theater in a while (though it could have just been the enthusiasm of the crowd working its magic on me).But I'm not going to pretend this is an epic finale. It was so unsatisfying a conclusion for the original Avengers team that it kind of taints what came before. What enthusiasm I had for the MCU to come wasn't exactly high (nothing good lasts forever, as many a former successful franchise has shown Hollywood time and time again), but now, my hopes are nil.EDIT: I found out that Thor's hammer does allow worthy wielders his power, so I rescind my ""rogue Pikachu"" complaint. The movie is still frustrating though."
1643,"If you like Iron man, Captain America or Thor do not watch this movie! Marvel has ruined everything....They will probably lose millions of fans... I will never see any of their movies anymore."
1644,I live Marvel .I love Superheroes.I love MCU and I loved Infinity War.The way I left the hall after I watched Infinity and The way I left the hall AFTER watching Endgane was completely different.So much hype and well deserved too but the ending was just not satisfactory at all.I liked bits of it but the other bit I just forced myself to like it just because I've been a fan of the creators and the actors and the characters for so long.But no It was not what I wanted not what we deserved.
1645,"First, I am a HUGE Infinity Wars fan.. I even collected expansive statues re-enacting the epic battle in my shelves (after winning infinity style war with my wife of course).As predicted, the Director made the end sappy enough for some to shed tears. I was shedding tears myself on the account I would never make the insane amount of money the actors (main casts) did. The first two hour was a total drag, it was as if the Director owes 3 hours to the audience or maybe in a more sinister manner they believe epic movie should run at least 3 hours (Hence... 3 hours 1 minute including credits).My major concern was the TIME TRAVELING plot which disregarded paradoxical continuity. Again, I am not a hater. I just found it highly inefficient if not plain stupid to have the remaining Avengers to go back in different TIMEs and PLACEs to collect each individual stone (the SOUL stone requires SACRIFICE!... duh). Would it be easier if they just went BACK in TIME (along with Captain Marvel this time) to the planet where Iron Man & friends battled Thanos and stripped him off the gauntlet which was already full of stones? If they did this, there wouldn't be any needs of casualty. Vision would be spared. Scarlet witch wouldn't need to be as traumatic then.Well, TIME HEIST damage has been done, but AGAIN:
1. Why didn't the future Nebula died instantly when she killed her PAST self? Turned out JC wasn't the only one to get resurrected afterall.
2. Why on earth did Iron Man have to conjure the gauntlet onto himself while risking DEATH? Why can't he instead put the gauntlet on Captain Marvel or HULK (who did it once and survived) or Thor and let them SNAP the hell of it? They were sorta IMMORTALS member of the Avengers with strength that most likely will withstand the impact anyway. But no, Stark had to get the end credit.
3. Finally, LOKI should've been brought to LIFE as the TIME TRAVELling thing would cancel out the event in which LOKI was killed by Thanos.I felt like this was an anticlimax to the flawless Infinity Wars... sorry Stan. If you want a better time traveling movie, go see ""Back to the future"" or even ""Hot-tub time machine"".. and ""Bill and Ted's excellent Adventure"""
1646,"I wanted to love it but the story doesnt make sense unlike the 21 movies before it that made all sense.
If hulk says you cant change the future by changing the past then you cant erase the alternate timelines too except make more alternate timelines by returning the stones.Returning the stones ,how did cap inject back in jane or dealt with red skull and the sacrifice ?It needed also more pace and action, infinity war was epic and this is like wtf happened.
No emotional involvment whatsoever."
1647,"Attention: this review contains spoilers.This is a very entertaining movie, very funny, and with many references to other movies in the franchise.But it is also a big disappointment. Since last year's snap and the reference to the time vortex in ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" it was absolutely clear that we would see a time traveling story. These are usually the best, e.g. ""Back to the Future"", ""Terminator"" (especially when we ignore the paradoxon), or ""Star Trek VI - The Voyage Home"". Still, even as the problems with causality in time travels are discussed by the Avengers team, only a few minutes later in the movie these thoughts are kind of ignored. So, actually there is not one, but several paradoxons. Being a huge fan of of well aligned time traveling stories, I really cannot take this movie serious, even from a MCU fan perspective. Here you can just take people out of their time, even let them die, and their future counterparts still exist. If it would be so easy, there would have been so many more solutions to the snap problem from the start. This was really disturbing.Further critical thoughts:
If Peter Parker's friends are back and everything is at the same age, then everyone from the Spidey movies has to have been snapped.Peter Parker is at the same funeral as Nick Fury. The trailer for the upcoming movie shows how they meet the first time. Is ""Far from home"" set in the past? Then why would Happy Hogan point out that Spidey is now on its own.Fat Thor was funny for a very short moment in the movie. Later it is just annoying. And this is not me having a problem with a fat hero. But it is much more about that senseless ending for Thor. Through Thor 1-3 we saw him evolve to be the leader who is needed as a successor of Odin. And now as his people is decimated, they just blend in as fishers, there is nothing to see from Asgardian culture or technology, he looks like Lebowski and finally just says: Well, I am off. How can that be Thor who had to evolve and show his worthiness?!? It's a terrible twist on this major character.It is no surprise that Iron Man's and Captain America's story arcs came to an end. it resembles comic story arcs from Civil War and Infinity War. And also contracts expired. Nevertheless, it was very obvious as well, because they really reached the end of their personal story arcs. I just expected Cap to be the one snapping.While we are at it: So, the snap is something very, very bad. Unless you do it against your enemy, meaning the bad guys. Then it's okay, just to erase everyone from existence.And about the stones. Do you remember when we saw in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" that hardly anyone would be able to hold them in the hand, without being destroyed by their power. Remember Starlord and the others working together for that purpose and him only being able, because he is a half-god? Well now, cheer up. It's happy stones week at McMCU. So everyone, can just take the stones and carry them around. Ehm ...Loki leaving with the Tesseract. Yes, another paradoxon. But necessary for the cash cow of Disney in order to make a Loki TV series.The death of Black Widow. Just sad. But also a little far stretched with this battle who want to die more for the other.The mind stone: Hmm, should we go back to the aftermath of the battle of New York in order to get the scepter or could we just go to some other time in the future when Vision is around, take enough time and get the stone without killing him? Let's do the first in order to free Loki and save the cash cow for Disney, as mentioned before. Yeah, that makes sense.Again the mind stone: Yes, everything has to be returned to its original place by Cap. Would have been great to see how makes a new scepter and puts the mind stone back in place. The same is true for the Tesseract and so on.The soul stone: So, Cap travels to Vormir again, returns the stone, but gets nothing in return? Just in order to keep the time line in order, which has been screwed up by many other things like killing all the bad guys from the past or Nebula?This review is now much longer than intended and actually I have many, many more points. I also liked a lot a lot about this movie, but these and further points are really killing it for me. Perhaps after time I will come to accept that this movie is the end of the Avengers, but I would have preferred a shorter version with a story that makes more sense instead of three hours overloaded with too many references and self-indulgement about the previous movies in the franchise. In the end, it felt a little bit as if I had seen one of these J J Abrams movies or series, where you are hyped until you get to the ending and just see that too many things didn't make sense after all."
1648,"To make it short (the movie was to long already): Infinity War was better, more entertaining and held up to it's expectations.This one just didn't do it for me. And I can't stress this enough: It was waaaaay to long."
1649,"After so many movies......
It seemed Thanos was more powerful and gave them a beat down without the stones. It would have been nice to see the avengers fight him with all his stones"
1650,Infinity War was much better. This movie was all over the place and lazy. They reduced Thor and Hulk to an absolute joke.
1651,"I guess they should have taken more time to create the film with good storyline,
It didn't meet the expectation which was set in Infinity war. Very slow pace and messy. Not satisfied."
1652,"The movie was like a bad dream, almost like a nightmare of a Marvel fan, full of weird things who doesn't really make sense. I mean, seying Thor fat and having both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir, only in some fan's nightmare. Seeing Hulk and Banner as one, is also different. And Captain becoming an old man after he lived his lost life..."
1653,"I really wanted to enjoy Endgame, after how amazing of a film I found Infinity War to be. It just lacked 'good vs bad' conflict that makes for dramatic tension and edge-of-seat viewing experience.Moreover, the majority of Avengers weren't brought into the film, until nearly the end. They also made the Earth free of Thanos and his minions, so there was no sense of ""quest"" in the film. The characters were more involved in convincing one another to join the battle against Thanos - but those efforts were not developed - which made the story flat.Ultimately, as a student of dramatic prose, I am disappointed. After seeing Captain Marvel and this turkey, I am back to boycotting Marvel films."
1654,"This movie was overall disappointing given the fact that there isn't really a satisfying moment. Nothing was shocking and nothing was new. Thanos no longer had any character or motive being reduced to yet another cliche marvel villain. By the second half of the movie the heroes completely had the upper hand and the suspense is withdrawn. The one ""big"" death in the movie was cheesy and lacked impact."
1655,"Although throughout the movie you kinda expect what is happening, Avengers Endgame closes out the 10+ years of MCU greatly and opens up nicely new ways for future MCU films to come, it's definitely an unforgettable experience and a must watch for every MCU Fans, Non-MCU Fans might feel lost in this one.
10/10 for MCU Fans.
7/10 for Non-MCU Fans."
1656,"Wanted to love this movie like I did infinity war, but unfortunately endgame is like Amanda Holden's face, smooth but no emotion."
1657,"Say goodbye to any semblance of a plot which is tied to character. This is not it. Bad writing and concept, probably born of corporate and committee-led ""creation teams"" has made these movies not into entertainment but just more fan service. When outrageous plot developments have no consequences because they can just be ""undone"" with time travel, the writers have no incentive to connect characters to decisions which permanently affect plot. The result is an empty but spectacular show full of glitter, movement, and noise. This is fine if that's what you wanted to see, but this is not a film about characters, despite its shallow attempts to bring it in for this or that moment (again, reversing all those character traits at a moments notice when it's convenient). It's disturbing to see fans rating this with 10's and ""best film ever"". One wonders if any kind of story is necessary at all to get the ""Wow"" reaction. Still, I applaud the filmmaker's efforts to add enough time to spotlight some of the characters, even if those efforts are in the end, transitory and a character mirage, to be forgotten, so that the big reset can take place. In this at least it is true to comics, and in that sense, this is a typical bit of bad comic plotting converted into film, so if praise is deserved for being true to mediocrity, at least they earned their 10/10 in that respect. Marvel movies are to film what Professional Wrestling is to the Olympics -- corrupt, shallow, and based on cheap thrills -- and worth watching only if that's what you came to see."
1658,Best movie ever and very good movie. My favorite movie ever when it come out on dvd I will buy it.
1659,"I didn't expect to like this movie as much as I actually did, there were some scene I didn't even see them comming.
I felt glue to the screen all the time, I even shed a tear, on thing I know for sure is that i'm a gonna miss a certain character.."
1660,"After all the hype, I expected to be extremely wowed. But I left feeling kind of meh. It was extremely long and dragged in several places. I felt like Infinity War was better overall. Good movie but seriously overhyped."
1661,Lots of unanswered plot holes where the time travel theory doesn't really make any Sense. It enjoyable as other marvel movies but as it's endgame it's lacking some ingredients.
1662,High hopes for this one but a bit of a let down Im sorry to say.
1663,"A poor finish to the avengers saga.
Too many characters with not enough to do.
The final battle was underwhelming.
Some of the main characters (Thor,hulk) reduced to buffoonery.
Some good points like cap and Starks final ending.
Thanos is probably one of the best baddies ever.
The guardian's and antman were poor.
Far too long a film and was padded in places although I can forgive it because we probably wo t be seeing the actors continuing in their roles.
Not as disappointing as game of thrones though.
Younger viewers will love it."
1664,"Personally End Game was one of the worst Marvel movies . The main reason for this was how rushed it felt , unexplainable scenarios and poor changes to characters.Rashness : at the start of the movie they killed thanos too quickly as they never showed any planning or anything it's just oh he is here and now he's dead, bye.Unexplainable Scenarios: these are just things that appear for no reason and are odd . 1 why does Pepper suddenly know how to fly a suit and fight . 2 when all the female characters show up in one place and fight with each other . 3 how did thanks go to the future with his entire army if there was a very small amount of Pym partials.Poor character changes : I will keep this short
1. I don't like fat Thor. I like labowski reference but no.
2. Thanos turns super powerful and from caring for life to just wanting to kill everyone
3. Old cap is just annoying as no more Steve Rogers fighting .In the end the only thing I liked was cap v cap fight and Tony Stark meeting his father . The rest of the film was on average OK."
1665,"Endgame and Infinity War are pretty much on the same level in terms of entertainment. And that level is not very high. Look, there's no magic. The first Avengers movie had it along with many of the other firsts in the group. But that magic has gone away. First off, please don't hit us over the head with the emotion hammer. You did this by trying to lengthen out shots where characters look into the distance... for 10 seconds OR look at each other and hug 5 times. What was 3hrs could have been easily 2.5hrs with a little slice of that here or there. Overall, you're seeing the film for the characters you love... you're almost forced to if you're a comic book fan. If you're not a fan - don't bother."
1666,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great. There were some very epic moments and some very sad moments. However, it was way too long. Without getting into spoilers, I found myself pretty bored within the first hour.80% of EndGame was really just a fan service/tribute to the MCU fans who watched all the previous MCU titles (most of which I saw). Even after the ~30 mins climatic battle (which was the best part of the film), however, the movie somehow continues to drag itself on again.I also felt there were some plot holes in the story/concepts; I had trouble understanding how it all worked.The humor was alright, but it is of typical MCU-grade comedy. Again, some jokes were good, while other jokes were just dragged on or plain cheesy.Overall I liked Infinity War better"
1667,"That part with all the women was so laughably bad. It was like all the girls against all the boys on the playground. I think that it's cool that they tried to make a feminist part, but the Russo brothers haven't talked to girls since 1st grade."
1668,"It took me a couple of viewings to finally embrace Infinity War last year, the ending divided many fans and made everyone question how Endgame would work. While I'm happy to say that it's an entertaining final movie, there are factors which stopped me from fully enjoying the movie. It's a fitting end to a colossal 22 films, although I didn't enjoy the ending, do not think that this will be the ultimate happy ending because it isn't!!There really is no need to explain the plot as many other reviewers have already done so. Instead I will mention what I liked and what I hated:Pros - The short but intense fight scene between the two Steve Rogers, excellent scene. The scene with Tony and Howard Stark, great scene. The emotional scene with Black Widow and Hawkeye, done really well. Brief scene with Loki, great as always. Loved the ending for Captain America.Cons - Professor Hulk, whoever decided this idea should never make a comic book movie again!! It gets worse; drunken and out of shape Thor, dear God, how can you turn the God of Thunder into this, I honestly didn't know if I should laugh or cry for the two of the most powerful members of the Avengers. Action scenes were decent at best, but nowhere as epic as Infinity War.Will I watch it again? Of course, but I'm in no hurry to do so."
1669,"Mild spoilers ahead.After a while watching ""Avengers: Endgame,"" the conclusion seems foregone and all notion of the unpredictable is lost. From the movie flatlines into a series of resolutions for characters I am not that invested in. I suppose the alternative wouldn't sit well with fans, but somehow the previous Avengers film ""Avengers: Infinity War"" seems like a huge feint. The characters reset to their previous lives (mostly), but without a huge sense of insight into dealing with the type of issues Thanos represented (overpopulation) going forward. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is a disappointing non-answer to serious questions which had elevated ""Infinity War"" to something beyond a hero flick. But I don't see how the film's audience could've accepted a darker vision, and overall the writers did a good job with what they had, subverting some superhero tropes (hunky Thor got fat!) and answering some expectations for meaningful deaths. ""Avengers: Endgame"" is enjoyable Marvel fun but too conventional to be rewarding for film-goers wanting something important and lasting to be said. However it is a relief that some of the Marvel heroes have finally ended their franchise potential, and have done so at a good spot. Watch the film to find out who."
1670,"The movie is overrated and just about average as compared to Civil war or infinity war. Overly melodramatic. Takes about 2 hours to for all the characters to come to terms with reality.
There is just one good fight scene where Thanos takes one on one a couple of avengers. After that the fight becomes a messed up playground and one cant make who is fighting whom. Just too many characters in fight.Infinity war was way better in way it handled the story plot and characters."
1671,"It was my least favorite Avenger movie. I've been a huge MCU fan from the beginning and it feels like this movie strayed from the core elements of previous ones. It thought they dumbed it down a bit. They were almost trying to be too funny (especially with the Thor & Hulk stories) that you lost a bit of the depth. Ultimately dissapointed compared to how hyped I was going into it. Also, they didn't need to kill that many people or finish them out so 'neatly.' Huge Captain fan, and I thought his ending didn't really fit what his character would actually choose to do. It was kind of a let down."
1672,"Marvel and Disney ambition is to become serial killers of successful ""classics"". Not because they are incapable of creating something awesome; they simply follow an agenda based on the politically correctness that requires the rewriting of every ""classical"" plot.What's wrong with the movie?
Duration. 3 hours is frankly too much.
The plot. The ""raison d'etre"" of the movie is double: to cancel out what happened in the previous episode (dead end) and write off the leading characters. There are indeed some discrepancies between what is known (half of the world population disappeared) and what we see: halving the world (pardon, the universe population) would have had negligible effects even in small town. Instead what we see (abandoned houses, scarce population) would suggest something way more devasting.
A problem in the plot is Nebula.There is no need to be a theoretical physicist to understand that ""hey, we have a big problem"". In the very same moment that the ""Nebula of the future"" (redeemed) kills the ""Nebula of the past"" (bad girl) we have a paradox and even contempling the multi-universe theory, the first Nebula should disappear.Characters.
It is quite irritating to see Thor as an obese alcoholic.
Antman makes too many useless jokes.
Captain Marvel powers are notoriously immense but here they are excessive even for a ""thor"" (synonym of God) not to raise the question of whether she was enough to do everything on her own.
Hulk is actually very nice but a jujube is not really the characteristic of an Hulk.
Thanos destroyed half of the life forms to give another possibility to the universe (it is not clear, however, why he should have destroyed even non-sentient beings, like birds, and even so, why he spared plants) ending up as a retired man dedicating his endless time to cultivate vegetables in a garden planet.But the difference between a cartoon plot, which reinvent many classical characters, and an ideological film is at the end: Thor abdicates from leader of ""new Asgard"" in favor of someone that has nothing to do with the Norse mythology; Captain America appoints his successor by giving him his ""symbol"", the Shield. Of course it isn't a mere coincidence that both successors are black. As Black Panther showed everybody, you can create ex-novo a great and successful character and every fan would be happy. On the contrary if your goal is rewrite the old character because you want to erase classics, then we are in a very different realm: ideology and brainwashing.The title is indeed correct: ENDGAME but in the sense that the classic heroes are buried because the actors are either too old or too whiteP.S. The initial reference to Disney was not accidental. They did exactly the same thing with Star Wars."
1673,"I was immensely disappointed with this film. Avengers: Infinity War was exciting, had a good solid plot and story. I couldn't wait to see the follow up after the unbearable cliff hanger we were left with.Avengers:End Game had none of these qualities. It felt like 2.5 hours of sentimental drivel and a 20 minute battle scene. I understand they wanted to wrap up the Avengers story but it just felt like it was more of a homage to the characters rather than a proper film. I was looking at my watch 2 hours in to see how long I had left before I could leave.The only exciting part was the battle scene and that was poorly designed and predictable. If you want to see how a good battle scene is performed watch Game of Thrones S7 E3. That was ten times more exciting than the Avengers battle scene.Special effects are always good in the Avengers films and this is no exception. It looks and sounds great. There were some amusing scenes especially involving Thor but they didn't save this disappointingly average attempt of finishing the franchise."
1674,"If you are going to do a two-part movie, you need to flesh out the second movie before you make the first one. Infinity Wars - why did Dr Strange give away his stone? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if to take the Soul Stone requires a soul, what happens when you return it? - Endgame - I don't know. Infinity Wars - if there was only one hope for victory, what was it? Endgame - I don't know. Dr Strange refuses to tell and obviously a few Avengers had a chance of taking and using the hand, even in Infinity. So is Dr Strange BS or what? Endgame has the biggest fight scene of the Marvel series but for the most part it was an all-in brawl. Dr Strange's group and Ebony Maw seemed to have a plan but no-one else did. To look real battle scenes do need to be choreographed.
So it's the end of an era and presumably the start of a new one. Afro-Americans did well. They have Black Panther, Cheadle stays on as War Machine (takes over the Ironman position?? )and Falcon becomes Captain America. Women fill a host of secondary positions but only Black Widow has been at the core of the Avengers and Captain Marvel was distanced from the Avengers (ie. underutilised) in Endgame. Black Widow went without any sign of a replacement so yep, we now have an all-male Avenger Squad. WTH?
As a movie Endgame was good but as a sequel and a wind-up of the series, it was lame."
1675,"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots.
I cried, lots.
I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots
I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!Fans! Assemble!"
1676,"The final chapter of the Avengers started of unexpected, but the 2 hours after that were boring, only focusing on some really cheasy jokes and there was barely a story line. They messed up a few major characters big time and only later in the film I began to enjoy the movie. The ending was of course really sad and I had a certain sympathy for the characters."
1677,"⭐ 10/10 RDJ u r awesome. Great performance by director, cinematographer. Actions is excellent. Dialogues are extremely good."
1678,"This movie was meant to be watched in an IMAX theater, especially because the sound makes up a very important part of the movie. To be honest, there were times when I felt that this movie is definitely 3 hours, but I can see why it was so necessary. This movie truly delivers what it promises it would! This movie really marks an important era in cinema."
1679,"That movie mess up way too many time lines, this Avenger title even become self convenience , when the world is half empty there is nothing to save, fight or die for. Just movie about being sad about people they lost, to eventually lost more.
I most hate Thanos change of mindset. He had plan, he think of the good for the universe. He change his mind, his turn again into pointless murdering without goals (or at least clear such). This wasn't as good as the Avenger movie before that. Seems that Marvel need a long break. AND STOP REBOOTING MOVIES ANS CHARTERS."
1680,"Tamed Hulk, traumatized Ironman, fantasy of yesterday - Cap America. what did I do with my hair - Cpt Marvel . Dr Stranger things and many more with fault of not their own were part of the final movie in one of the most successful and entertaining spectacles of the past decade.
The movie itself was a huge collection of familiar faces and scenes, from all major events in MCU, lacking cohesive structure which distorted flow of the movie. The spectacle was too long and action sequences were unevenly spaced which created over too long moments that were more about homage to the last decade of superhero bonanza and tremendous logistic achievement. After all getting all of the cameo actors from the last movies and inserting them into this plot must have been very difficult. Did they suceed ? No, they did not. The effort was admirable and gave us some really touching moments but resulted in unnecessary extending already too long movie. This was confusing the main story plot too much. There were just too much of it. Movie did not offer viewer any spectacular skirmishes in a first two hours. Thats what made IW so special. Endgage was lacking these impactful moments. It is clear that the best was saved for last but this only validates that movie did not have to be so long. If a movie would be filled with IW level of awesome than yeah, bring it on but the problem is that it was stretched too thin and these moments are just not there, not in the beginning anyway.PG-12 rating is a culprit here. If movie's rating was higher I am sure that scenes filled with nothing would be at least more electryfying but because this is a movie aimed at future and former fans, the lighter representation of after apocalypse universe was the only thing Disney corporate machine could have come up with and still get away with achieving PG-12 rating. Younger audience and older audience looked bored in the cinema though. The balance was not achieved here.The final stand off was amazing though and I will say that it is worth the price of admission. When I will be rematching Endgame on blue ray I think I will just skip to the last few chapters just to experience all this wonderfully done explosions and amazingly done fights. It was just epic and the team definitely raised the bar here.Overall the movie was ok but it did not top IW for me. This one will still be the best Avenger movie."
1681,"Having been an ardent fan of the avengers series and especially been awed by the brilliance and creativity of how Marvel managed to juxtapose the many superhero universes and crafted it cleverly to meet in the same time and space.. I was sadly disappointed by the lack of a supernova ending to culminate this epic journey. What you get instead Is the conflict within yourself wherein your mind, which is hardwired to like this movie, Is being challenged by your heart which starts to realise that you wanted more .. way more.The plot was consumed by a complex theory of time travel which seemed forced and not to mention it took most of the prime time. The remainder was more focused on the characters making peace with their past rather than the end game itself. If anything at all the actual end game is probably 45 mins long. And the plethora of superheroes in the plot made it too crowded and at times forced- especially towards the end. Out of the many superheroes whose presence you question or their portrayal.. the most notable fall from grace was Thanos himself whose part was just academic. After his epic performance and build up in the last series this was a damp squib at its very best. If you were expecting the likes of an epic battle where an immovable force meets an unstoppable object.. where you root for the good guys but respect the bad one? This ends with a complete digression and confusion and starts too late and gets over too soon.Go for it only because you are now committed.. but save money on the pop corn!"
1682,"All has been said, fanboys stop overrating your S***"
1683,"This felt like a wrap up. The acting was phoned in, the script was lazy, the cast was PACKED - but interesting characters were marginalized, mediocre characters were getting way too much light and other characters were inexplicably included.I wish someone could have explained to the Russo brothers that Thor is, literally, a god. He's the Norse God of Lightning. ""God"" being the operative word. Come on, mate.Jeremy Renner's 80's dad rendition of Hawkeye was grating.The Avengers: Marginalizing War Machine since 2010. They had almost a decade to get War Machine fleshed out and they did nothing with him. Don Cheadle is an amazing actor and he (as well as War Machine as a character) was just wasted.If Mary Sue and Gary Stu had a baby, cloned it and forced the clones to mate they'd name their baby Tony Stark. Yep, he's still solving everything using software he himself wrote to be capable of modeling EVERYTHING because genius.Their solution to the loss of half of all existing life was absolutely pathetic. The characters even mocked it when it was first brought up but eventually it got Starked. Yes. Both Tony Stark and Dr. Banner explained exactly why it was a stupid idea - then Tony ""Da Genius"" Stark gives Jarvis like TWO COMMANDS and a qualifier and boom - the problem is solved. Lazy.Tom Holland (Spider Man) was still squeaking, still bumbling his way through everything.They just touched all bases and wrapped it up. It felt like a wrap up."
1684,"As i thought the end was obvious and so expected, and that way they bring everyone's dead back to life like Dragon Balls does is very childish. Like you are certain that the heroes will never die and if somehow they die there is a way to bring them back and they always win. I thought this movie was targeted to adults, which was not at all."
1685,"This is one over hyped movie that under delivers. Marvel really is comedy and lacks the darker tone of the DC universe. Some people like the light Marvel universe but it's really lost something along the way. You need to throw common sense out the window with the this one and Captain Marvel, wtf haha. Enjoy."
1686,"It takes some time to get going. Then there is this obsession to try to be funny, that is sometimes a bit annoying. The Final Battle is way to overloaded and that not very subtile feministic scene at the end of the battle is kind of pathetic (you will get what I mean, when you see it). I love female superheros, but that particular scene doesn't make sense at all. Please stop ruining good movies, with political statements.
It's worth a watch, no doubt, but I was kind of disappointed. Its way to melodramatic for a freaking superheromovie."
1687,Wtf are you doing? Thor and hulk were amazing they look dumb and you made them look stupid. What about this damn endig?!!! What was that? Its like im watching a low B movie!! What about the action? Do you call that a movie?!?!? Ive been waiting for this for years and now i lost interest in marvels!!!
1688,"It is more of a recap of previous Marvel film. It seems to be shot across all the previous film. The thing is, I really dislike the word ""Quantum"" after watching the last ant man film. But Avengers Endgame put the last nail in the coffin."
1689,"In just ruined my entire day watching this crap,so i want to warn you,prepare to be disappointed,the movie is just a total garbage."
1690,"Predictable Boring
Nothing Thnos 😹
How stupid
🙈🙈"
1691,"My friend, who I'd taken for the movie, fell asleep during the show. Seriously.The first hour or so of the movie will do that to you. Unless you are a fanatic fan of The Avengers. Maybe even then. I am and I was checking messages on my phone almost throughout.Sad."
1692,"On first viewing you love how everything is tied up. Stop there! If you've only seen this movie once do yourself a favor and don't ever watch it again. On second viewing this is a below average overly long film in which very little happens in a bloated second act. The only thing that still stands up is the Avengers trinity of Thor, Captain America and Iron Man versus Thanos, but it real makes you question the power levels of these characters, Thanos took them all out with no stones. The time travel subplot has more holes than swiss cheese I don't care how much screen time they gave explaining it and ""joking"" about it, I quote joking because in the MCU references count as jokes. There's the soul stone, in the last movie you had to make a sacrifice, how is Black Widow's suicide a Hawkeye sacrifice? How does Thanos not feel all 5 stones leaving his glove? Why so much build up about the glove in the previous movies if Iron Man can make one in a few hours, there's more, there's so much more but, at the end of the day Disney's 3-hour infomercial manage to make billions of dollars while not anger China or SJWs in the porcess, so for that alone this was impressive."
1693,This movie was the perfect culmination of the past 10 years of story building for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The threads they have been weaving for the characters and their connections to each other. You take this journey with then and the time jump to 2023 fixes any future cinematic timeline issues moving forward lol.
1694,"For me personally this film was just too darned long. As I sat watching it I suddenly realised against all hope and expectation that I was actually a little bored - a feeling I never got from its predecessor.Visually it's stunning (as you'd expect) and I can see how to a great many people it has the ultimate wow factor but for me it doesn't quite hit the spot.Personally I'm struggling to put it in my top 3 MCU movies.I definitely prefer Infinity War and Guardians Of The Galaxy and then it's a toss up between this, Civil War, The Winter Soldier and Ragnarok."
1695,"Thor almost killed thanos in the last movie, and thanos had infinite stones with him.
In this movie Thor could not even hit a thanos without the stones.
The Marvel girl blown away thano's spaceship in 1,2seconds, but could not even hit thanos
Iron man, without his helmet, took a direct hit in the face and everything was ok.Allll right, let me stop. They could have done better"
1696,"Wow, that was a major anti climax. With a title as 'Endgame' you'd expect it to surpass every story before, not an endless get together, 1 major battle where 1 action here solves it all and then a lengthy farewell. Wished they would have spent more on a good script instead of on 1 big scene full of CGI"
1697,"The good:. The fan service was very good
It gave people what they wanted, a heroic send-off for Iron Man and sentimental ending for Captain America. The revisiting of previous movies was great overall. I almost lost my mind when Cap picked up Thor's hammer. I was glad Captain Marvel wasn't in the movie very much.The bad:. U was hoping the Russo's would give Capt Marvel a better character, more likeable. The interaction between her and Peter at the end was best bit if dialogue she has had. The biggest thing though was I just couldn't get past the time travel and creation of a multiverse. By creating this multiverse and their actions not affecting the past, it lowered the stakes. Loki gets away, no problem, we'll just ignore that and go to another point in history to get what we need. Thamos from Guardians of Galaxy dies, no problem. I know there is a certain level of suspension of disbelief in all MCU movies. These just felt like a cheap and easy way to write. So Cap creates a new timeline by living in the past apparently. Does he stop Hydra from infiltrating SHIELD? Does he prepare his timeline for Thanos?Also, it probably hurt that we had to wait a year. the build up was massive and nothing can really live up to that level of hype.I've seen it twice and I don't care to see again for awhile. I have seen Infinity War 7 times as point of reference."
1698,"Spoiler free.....
For those who have given this a 10, take that with a pinch of salt, it really isn't. There's a strong argument that suggests infinity war was an overall better film.
Endgame drags in places as it tries to cram in so much more, building up to a noteably predictable ending.
The direction some of the characters have taken this time around is polarising and didn't work for me. Some key MCU characters going forward we're also given limited screen time which, for those keen to know what the future holds.. I'm not sure anyone really knows now.Whilst the changing of the guard will be welcomed you do get a sense of, this is really the end of a great journey for marvel. Barring a series of solo follows ups and a play in the tv series space we're unlikely to see an avengers style films of this magnitude anytime soon!I've always been a fan ever since the iron man graced our screens, however for me, they have slipped up quite a few times along the way (Thor series) was poor and captain marvel was average."
1699,"This movie could of easily been 2 hours. Cant believe how close I was to falling asleep during it. Yes are there a few good actions, sure are. But there is too much stalling and 'build up"" between. There were already 22 films for build up. Enough with the fore play. It was time for a the pay off and sadly they dropped the ball."
1700,"While Infinity War was quite flawless, Endgame had a whole lot of loopholes.1. The movie runtime could've been reduced by a good 30 minutes. Hawkeye was given way too much screen time whereas Captain Marvel's involvement with the whole plan was missing. She was touted all this long that she's this great superhero that's gonna save the Avengers but her involvement was negligible in the film. Sure she did a couple of scenes that put the Avengers back in the fight but all of that was shown within a minute each time in a 180 minute movie.2. Didn't Nebula of the present warn Avengers about the sacrifice that the soul stone would need?3. Time travel wasn't handled very well as compared to similar films and shows like Dark. If Thanos of 2014 knows about Avengers plan in 2023, doesn't that create a divergent timeline? There are a lot of such moments that create several divergent timelines.4. It wasn't really necessary to bring every single one of the characters on screen. I would've been okay if Wakandan Queen or Jarvis or Joe Russo himself wouldn't have showed up.5. The references to the older films felt forced at times. While the elevator scene was perfect but some of the quips and easter eggs were not really needed.6. The final fight scene disappointed me a little due to the heavy use of CGI and dark settings. One thing I liked about Marvel was that their fight scenes felt real, most of them pictured in daylight. It was DECUs thing to film war scenes in an overwhelming CGI background. I was wondering at times during the last battle scene if it was really Earth. Titan in Infinity War felt more real than Earth itself in Endgame war scene."
1701,"To say this movie was awesome is an understatement. I'm still processing everything but OMG was it truly a masterpiece. I'm struggling to think if I've ever given a 10 before, but if I have it's only ever been one or two in my life.
This certainly was a 10... However you definitely need to see ALL the movies from 2008's Iron Man through Infinity war. And I do mean ALL of them for this movie to truly shine or even to make sense. Even given the 3 hour running time this movie makes no attempts to fill you in, and nor should it. You need to be well prepared going into thisThat said I saw the opening night fan event showing, and got a commemorative coin that is actually metal, heavy, and super cool! But it was shown in a regular theater with mediocre sound, so I also have tickets for a showing on Friday as well in a Dolby theater room, which I can't wait to see. Now I loved Avengers Infinity War, but I laughed, cheered and got way more emotional in this movie than that one. I've been in theaters where the crowd cheered or laughed before, but I don't think I've ever seen it let alone experienced it to this degree. The emotions were just flowing to say the least.I really liked how the first act brought you into the aftermath of this post-snap world, and really focused on the hardship of what things would have been like after such an event. And while this was all very sad the one thing I was shocked about was that they successfully pulled off so much humor. Humor in a marvel movie is no surprise, but given how Infinity War ended I really thought this was going to be a dark and dreary movie, and yet it gave me some of the best laughs while still taking itself serious. It's quite a magic act to pull offThe second act really sets the game plan in motion for how they plan to ""fix"" things and while suspenseful and intriguing it still kept up great and appropriate humor. Obviously humor is a subjective thing and some might bash it. I tend not to like potty humor style but more organic or situational humor, which I thought they just nailed. But at the same time there were some heartache moments that just brought you on the edge of your seat, or made you wipe your eyes. Towards the middle of the movie I was just glued to my seatAnd then there's the third act. OMG... As you would expect it sets up a mega finish as they really are wrapping up the culmination of 11 years and 20+ films worth of story lines and this is what it's all about. The action was great, effects second to none, a bit chaotic at times but that just adds to the intensity. There were moments I just yelled and cheered like I never have at a movie before. I watched it with my daughter who I've taken to or seen every one of the marvel movies with and we were clenching each other through the last 15-20 minutes as it was just so intense, amazing and emotional.Coming out of the movie we were both just stunned and in awe, just trying to process the emotions of what we just saw. To bring out so much emotion in us, and from what we saw so many others is just unbelievable. That in itself just tells you how extraordinary this movie was and is a true credit to everyone involved in making this film. All I can say is don't read any spoilers as there are sure to be some now that it's out. Get some tickets, go and see it for yourself, you will not regret it, but again if you've missed any of the movies in between Iron Man and Infinity war, get caught up first."
1702,"Brilliant movie. What a climax!
They did a good job in concluding the Avengers series.
10 on 10! Must watch.
I laughed, was speechless and even cried."
1703,"The premise of the quantum realm and time travel in MCU is, when you change the past, you're not changing the future. You made alternate realities. Like how nebula is killing her past self yet she didn't die with her. And how Thanos came to the future and lost means there's a reality where he never got any Infinity stones, coz if it's the same reality, Guardians of Galaxy wouldn't even be assemble.Now, how could Rogers change his past yet he could still be in the ""normal"" reality?"
1704,This movie was really good. I remember my self screaming at the movies sooooo bad along with every other fan! I watched this movie 2 times at the cinema! It was something else! But still something was missing! I don't know what but I gotta say that infinity war was superior! At least for me!
1705,"Avenger's Endgame is the finale of almost 20 years of Marvel's cinematic universe. As such, I went in with high hopes and came out with rather mediocre mixed feelings. A lot of this movie rides on the audience being emotionally attached to the existing Marvel Cinematic Universe movies.
The story-line is rather simplistic to be honest, if you watched Avenger's Infinity War, the ""solution"" that they comes up with feels a little Deus Ex Machina.The writers clearly and obviously wrote off any explanations of what the characters *should* have done by saying that there is canonically only one way that the story could have happened (by Strange checking the future timelines); in what is clearly an example of lazy writing.The visuals are fine, the music is great, character development is lacking; none of the characters actually make any on-screen development. In fact, to save on screen time, both the Hulk and Thor make off-screen development which feels cheap and misplaced.
Instead, the writers spend most of their time dwelling on rather lack lustre fight scenes and bad jokes. It was clear that this movie could have been so much more, if only be examining the deleted scenes.If you are a hardcore fan of Marvel movies, this is obviously a 100% watch, you will get all of their Easter eggs and nods to previous movies. If you are watching this movie series casually, and you are not emotionally attached to any of the characters & you can disconnect yourself from the nostalgia, then you will see behind the golden mask that the Russo Brothers and co. have crafted for this movie, that there is a lacklustre mess with no direction."
1706,They seem to have gone more family friendly and the comedy inserts they put in from here to there are just cringe worthy. More drama than action. No thanks
1707,"I usually don't like marvel or full arcade action movies but when I notice the high rating I thought It worth to give it a try. What I found is a soap opera of bunch of super heroes. Crying, cuddling, over sensitive. Even Hulk himself was taking selfies like a princess. WTF !Besides, there was only 15 minutes of action in a 3 hours movie. I have never seen so overrated movie on the site before.Enjoy !"
1708,"Amazing story,acting,editing,producing,directing!im not good at writing a review but im gonna try itthe movie started a couple of weeks after the and of infinity war
after 20 minutes the avengers killed thanos"
1709,"Avengers Endgame is the best MCU movie ever.
It truly justifies the end of Infinity Saga"
1710,I'm a fan of sci-fi movies & following the marvel series I just enjoyed the endgame every second of it..
1711,This movie has been candidate to the Academy Awards for best picture.
1712,"I love it
It's a very good movie to watch
I'm from Iran and I love thid movie
I follow this movie from the first episode of it"
1713,"In my point of view this is the best movie MCU ever create
Russo brothers make this awesome, hope they can make a better one tomorrow"
1714,"People are out of their minds giving this movie a 10. It's good action and has some amazing visuals, but the story is seriously lacking and slowly plays out.They straight up ruin Thor and Hulk. I'm not sure what the purpose of having their movies were. I was waiting for Thor to summon the godly magic he has and transform back into the stud he was, but nope. Just the Lebowski version with lighting bolts flying out of his eyes. I hear people talking about ""oh he's got PTSD from all the things he's been through"". Give me a break. A. It's a movie. B. He's a God. C. Just give me the comic book hero we came to watch. Not this fat corny burnout.The Hulk. They made him a straight weenie. He's the ""professor hulk"" nobody wanted. Well, maybe six people total in the world. Everyone else wanted to see hulk finally get back to form and smash!!!! Instead he lightly taps a car hood and meanders off. The Bulk should never meander anywhere.Then there's the story that actually mainly revolves around the two characters you care nothing about. Nebula and Hawkeye. Sure they a cool to some degree but again, nobody wants to watch them on screen for hours.The whole time travel travesty they pulled with the alternative times lines really stupified things. I love how people say they can explain it when the writers and directors can't agree. Just google some articles and watch some interviews about it. In the end the time travel nonsense they pulled in the story doesn't make sense.Why is it that four avengers can take on Thanos with the Gauntlet and almost win, but non Gauntlet Thanos can whoop them all?How does Hawkeye live from that blast ending up in the sewer unharmed? How does starks human made nano tech suit hold the stones? I highly doubt it's nearly as powerful as a Gauntlet formed by giant elves from a dying star.Good lord, I could go on and on. There's three hours of this stuff. But what's good is an epic end battle and travels back to some of your favorite scenes from the previous films. Cap wielding the hammer is
The best part.All in all it's entertaining, but in. I way should be the categorized as one of the best movies ever."
1715,"I've seen almost all of them, But I don't like every one, I'm the standard marvel black!"
1716,"Felt that the time travel plot was really a cop out and has been massively overdone albeit. Fat Thor was a joke too, was there any need? All in all a bit messy and unimpressive."
1717,"What secret magic trick did Iron Man use on Thor to where he just touched Thanos Infinity Gauntlet in a matter of two seconds and all the gemstones just appeared on his hand; as if the gemstones had a mind its own to appear in the exact same placement on Iron Man's hand. That part of the movie became an illusion without detail. Then, Iron Man dies. SMH"
1718,"Literally the whole first hour of the movie doesn't matter. We just spend the first part of the movie sulking around. Like, I get it already. I spent the whole last year accepting what happened in IW. I don't need to do it for an hour of a 3 and half hour movie. The rest of the time the Russo's can't handle out of all the complex emotions in this movie (Thor's funny depression), sharp pain from loss of loved ones boiled down to vague sadness, let's give Cap a happy ending to the expense of his character and common sense. They couldn't be bothered to give anyone a complete story arc so they just tried killing off/shooing away characters they didn't know what to do with (hey where's captain marvel, Valkyrie, shuri). While conveniently changing other character's complete behavior to fit the story (here's looking at you, hawkeye and hulk). The Russo's couldn't decide what to do so they just replayed marvel biggest hits with the biggest BS time traveling Deus ex machina and pieced it together with the roughest edits I've seen since Arrested Development season five. Maybe keeping the script from every actor up until the last minute isn't the best idea. But hey, the movie made a lot of money. So why should the story matter?"
1719,"There's only one word that can describe the first 2/3 of the movie ""dry"". Not only was there no action, but they wasted characters and it was just boring. If it wasn't for the epic battle and the sacrifice in the last 1/3, I would rate this movie a 1 or 2."
1720,Expected more from the Hulk after his no show in Infinity War and then after that mess the writers turn around and make one of the mightiest hero's (Thor) a drunk. Infinity was was far better and it was the perfect set up for End game that the writers screwed up
1721,At the beginning just nothing special totally no need 3 hours for the movie....
1722,"I have never been the biggest MCU fan, but for the most part I have enjoyed all of the movies they have made. When I came into this movie I wasn't expecting anything that would blow my mind away and after watching the movie I feel like my prediction was correct.The biggest problem for me wasn't the time travel, or the plot holes that came from the time travel... My biggest problem with this movie was the out of place humor. I was expecting this movie to be a lot more serious and grounded, but instead we get Fortnite jokes and fat Thor. I am fine with jokes, but in a series movie like Endgame it just did not work with me. The first act of the movie was also very slow, but unlike most people I actually thought the first act was pretty entertaining. Another problem I had with the movie was when they were trying to find the Soul Stone. So Hawkeye and Black Widow both go to try and obtain the soul stone... Nebula knew that it takes a soul for a soul to obtain the stone, yet she doesn't say anything to the team. That is strong information not to share to Hawkeye and Black Widow, so that whole scene did not make any sense to me. Another problem with that scene was how they got the stone. To obtain the soul stone you have to sacrifice someone you love... they did not sacrifice each other, instead both of them were just trying to kill themselves.The movie had a lot of small errors, but it was still a very entertaining movie. The action in the movie was stunning along with the acting from Downey Jr. and Chris Evans. It's pretty obvious a lot of care and effort went into this movie, while also pleasing the fans. I would highly recommend going out and watching this movie."
1723,"I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and have been so excited for this movie, and to be honest, I'm disappointed. It was a decent movie, and I was invested in the story, but it was no where near my expectations.This movie was way too over hyped and in my opinion, messy. Humor was good, emotion was there (at the end), and concept was cool. But, ruined certain character arcs, was poorly executed, and was not worth the hype I gave it before seeing it.There were moments that made me very emotional, laugh, and made me jump with excitement which is all a plus. I came out of the theater crying a mix of happy and sad tears, but the more I think about it, there were so many flaws (mostly to do with character arcs). It was so fast paced with the characters and ruined the genuine connection we built with them in past movies. It's almost like they're completely different people. All in all, it was an ending we won't forget... even though it kind of flopped."
1724,"I don't know why people are calling it the best Marvel movie till date. Come on guys did you not watched infinity war. To be honest, that was the greatest movie and this was no way near that. It has so many loopholes and extra scenes, I don't know what Russo brothers were thinking. It got lucky just because of all the buildup that the previous movies made, otherwise it would have end up just like justice league."
1725,"You can not imagine how this movie is going to be good unless you watch it first. It had everything that a movie should have. The visuals and the sounds. However, the Drama factor has played it well this time as in Avengers infinity war.
First it gets you back when Thanos erased 50% of the creatures in the universe. It starts with Barton and his family's being erased ( Clint Barton was not in Infinity war). And then it goes to the story where is Tony stark is stuck in the space with Nebula. And he doesn't know anything about what happened to the earth and if his friends and lovers are still alive. Here when Captain Marvel appears to be the savior and gets him and Nebula safe to the earth.The members of the team that still alive wants to have the infinity stones again to make everything as normal as it was by killing Thanos and get the stones out of his hand. Nebula and Captain Marvel help to find Thanos' spot as it's been not found after he erased the half of the creatures in the universe. They go to where he settles. But before that you can see thanos is really affected with burns over all his body. He goes to his hut and there is a light coming at him with any warning and hits him and Captain Marvel tries to grap him and stable him. The other team are making to get his glove and they do when Thor cuts his hand. Sadly the glove is empty and there was no stones on it. Thanos said that he use the stones to destroy the stones and that is why he gets affected by it which made him inevitable. Thor cuts thanos' head. And the end of the scene where rocket said why did you do that and thor says i went for the head.After 5 years when everyone leaves and having no hope to get everything back. Scott lang (Ant-Man) gets out of the quantum world and get back to the earth after 5 years. He thinks that it is just 5 hours no more. He has no idea what is going on and hardly trying to figure it out. He still has hope for the Avengers to comeback even stronger with his idea of time traveling through the quantum leap that Doc Hank has made.
He successfully made it where everyone accept his theory. They just got the chance to travel the past and get the stones again and use it for the good to the world where eventually they have, but with Thanos' knowning of what is happening. And he tries to make that not to happen by sending The first Nebula to the future and take the stones. Here is a spoiler when Clint and Nat went to get the saul stone they have to sacrifice one of them to get it, it's a dramatic scene when Natasha sacrifices herself for her only family and that's her last wishes.Eventually, they try to use the stones but still there is no one are capable of using it. thor said he is going to do it but he wasn't in a good shape as Tony Stark said. Bruce Banner takes it and puts it in his hand and try to make a flick but he falls down because of the power of the stones. On the other side, Nebula opens the Quantum gap to thanos and his army. Where here the endgame war starts. Acknowledging that everything gets back and everyone is alive again because of The Hulk's flick. The war starts and everyone is back. Thanos vs the avengers. Captain America can lift thor's hammer which is a great scene btw. I don't want to spoil what has happened in this battle. But at last Tony stark take the glove that he made and wears it and flick his finger to erase thanos and his army. And says i... i'm ... iron man and fell down. Where everyone is surrounded him with tears. He peacefully closed his eyes and pepper says you finally can rest now after 10 years of glory and honor.It is a great movie and great ending for Iron Man and the last movie of MUC."
1726,Just watched the new Avengers-movie. It's simply fantastic and a must-watch for every Marvel-Fan. It contains everything I expected and wished for an so much more. It's hard to put in words without a spoiler. Find out by yourself and enjoy.
1727,"Don't listen to the haters, it's amazing! Seriously, this is the movie of the year!"
1728,"There has never been any kind of cinematic event like it and there may never be one again, but Endgame is the kind of superheroic fanservice most people have only dreamed of."
1729,"After watching all the previous movies related to this one, I was excited to see this one. The crazy ending of Infinity War left me moody and waiting for answers.Endgame is funny, sad and major! I laughed so much watching this and shred some tears. If you have seen previous movies you can totally get all the jokes and winks toward us Marvel fans :)Worth to watch at least three times! I seriously can not get over this movie!"
1730,"I have a strong sentimental attachment for the MCU. I watched the movies for 11 years, and this was almost like a breakup for me. Infinity War was one of my best movie experiences, i was beyond shocked, exited and emotional. And happy, beacause no movie of the mcu has accomplished that in me, and was because the bad guy wins (happy endings got boring honestly), all those uncomfortable one-line jokes and witty remarks were few, all the encounters and character development were meaningful and wonderful set, and the battles, my god, the battles were so epic, so imginative and so so great. all of what this movies lacks. it´s 3hrs of pure emotion, with a bad written story and not particularly appealing visuals. It seems as if they went with the first draft of the scrpit. i can´t understand all the glory this movie gets. I feel very ripped off"
1731,Fascinated to see all the super heroes..but more surprises and high moments were expected
1732,"Totally average movie , full of plot holes , and silly time travel nonsense , which is used more stupid and so has so much illogical inconsistency than any time travel movie I have ever seen. It's very slow , way too much talking and very little action. And it's way too long . This is the best story line they come up with ? Don't believe the hype ... worthy o a digital download but that's it when it comes out, but don't rush to see this big pile of rubbish"
1733,"Let be honest here, after infinity war marvel really had a lot to live up to, and they simply set the bar to high. There were several missed chances to provide fans with a truly epic conclusion. The entire thing felt rushed. The story felt rushed and not well thought out. To be honest I'm just really really upset. I took part of the day off to sneak out and go see this movie without my wife because i was confident i would see it again with her, but i don't think i can sit through that again. It kinda felt like the last star wars, or the solo movie disney did. They simply ran out of gas. The take off was spectacular but there just wasn't enough gas in the tank to bring it home."
1734,"Best movie ever, really? Is it the only movie you have seen or even the only marvel movie you have seen? 10/10's are just not being serious. Far too boring , comic movies must be fun and this film is light on that."
1735,"From the moment I saw the idiotic quantum tbeory scene, I realized that there the movie depended on a lot of bull sh to weave a crazy plot over different time zones and eras and different planets."
1736,"At the ending.. rahther using capt. America bring back the infinity stone..Just send Hulk back, to the time just where thanos arrived in the Asgardian Space ship..
And tell hulk to wipe out thanos and with his entire fleet.OrCapt. America can just back to the time just when the team about entering the quantum realm and tell them all not to send nebula..Done.."
1737,"It just doesn't. It's not that this is a bad movie. It's entertaining and nostalgic. It also does cap off the story in a good way.
However, there were a bunch of fan theories online before this movie came out that would have made for a far more interesting adventure. Captain Marvel did not need to be there and I think that Disney made a huge mistake with that character (and, especially, ""actress"").
I'm not going to spoil anything, so I'll just leave it there. Worth a watch, sure.
Infinity War was hundreds of times better in story and execution."
1738,"I just want to say a few things:
Cap can suddenly hold and call Mjølnir, hammer of Thor??? Inconceivable!
Hulk is suddenly nice, clever and funny??
Captain Marvel could swipe clean the whole shebang, but not Thanos?
Cap suddenly decides to grow old and live an alternate timeline, without the rest?
Is there NO respect for the back-catalogue and the comics anymore?
And don't even get me started on the time-travel issue.
So disappointed.
No, no and no again, Marvel !!"
1739,Infinity War was way better. Endgame is super slow and even at times pretty boring. The third act somehow misses the mark and falls short of being the epic finale we've all been waiting for. Overall it was okay. It wasn't horrible. Definitely not the best either.
1740,"Infinity war I loved. The pacing, the introduction of the many characters and the jaw dropping ending. I went back to see it three times.Endgame wholeheartedly disappointed. Why?**SPOILERS**Okay, let's get the plot holes/weak links out of the way:-1) The original glove had to be forged by a dying star. Somehow Stark created one on Earth...no explanation.
2) The slight of hand to steal the stones from Thanos...really?
3) How does Iron Man's gloves survive having all Infinity stones on it.
4) Tilda Swinton gave up the Time Stone far too easily.
5) I could be wrong but I didn't think the Tesseract could be handled by a human?
6) Several avengers could barely keep Thanos using the glove before. In fact, they failed. It seemed much easier this time round!
7) DId no one want to tip off Hawkeye and Black Widow as to how they had to unlock the Soul Stone?
8) All of a sudden Captain America seems to be able to use Thor's Hammer at will when it moved only a little before. What makes him more worthy now?
9) Captain Marvel WOEFULLY underused. Shows up to run through a few ships and land a few punches. What a waste.
10) Did Nick Fury, the instigator of the Avengers, not get an invite to the finale? Rude.These are off the top of my head as I write this. I am sure I could think of more.Fair play to Marvel for wanting to make this a more human story...I think. But sadly they failed to create a emotional finale and and succumbed to the inevitable fighting.I didn't get the 'feeling' of the 5 years they skipped over, Black Widow holding things together, Hawkeye going rogue. The quantum timeline plot line is weak in my opinion and slightly predictable.The loss of BW and Iron Man should have been major heart breaking sequences but I saw the BW scene coming a mile off and I was too bewildered as to how Stark got the stones to give a damn about his death scene.I wanted more of a surprise, more originality, this is a comic universe where they've spent years devising a story arch. Is this the best ending they could have come up with? One that ends in another fight, a slight of hand and a click of fingers? Nope sorry, I felt little jeapordy and zero tension compared to Infinity War where I ended up almost falling of my chair.I'm no writer but I've seen enough Sci Fi and read enough comics to know they could have done so much more. Why not split dimensions? Make half the team sacrifice themselves for others? Or something radicallike that. Not a timeline do-over with another big fight with only a couple of fatalities!I could rant for a long time. It's not a terrible film, The Last Jedi it isn't. It's just utterly average, hence my 5/10. With 3 Hours they could have done so much more and my expectations after the superb Infinity War were high. I am mortified to be as disappointed as I am.I want to return and give it another chance...but 3.5 hours in a movie theatre. I don't want to..which is the biggest tear jerking result of the movie....."
1741,"Big Marvel fan and watched all the previous movies repeatedly.
This movie however was well below expectation.
Love women equality but this was a bit too much.
No comparison to Infinity war.
Fat thor thru the entire movie...and inspite of having his hammer and axe. He still gets beaten up.
Hulk already shown as professor hulk and not hulking out and even fighting Thanos.
Iron man only having one suit, would he not have a back up plan and have hundreds of other suits.
So many other holes that you can pick thru the movie. Definitely not a great end to the Marvel Saga."
1742,"I saw the movie this tuesday ☺ (3 days before US ).
Too long, no post credits scene, too cheesy at some points.
And too many bad ideas...
The movie is set 5 YEARS LATER then infinity wars...WTF...
Thanos dies twice 🤣🤣🤣,
Hulk is ridiculous
Thor is ridiculous
The remade of the Thanos /Gamora Vormir scene by Hawkeye /BlackWidow is ridiculous
Cheesy sacrifice of Tony Stark with a ""Batman v Superman"" inspired funeral scene
Anthony McKee the new Captain America WTF...And few good ideas ....
Time paradoxes (where is Loki ?), funny scenes
Captain using Thor's helmet (surely the greatest idea or the movie)"
1743,"I am bit confused and I wonder if I am.the only one.Don't get me wrong. I appreciate hard work put by the team but it seems that praise it is getting from all corners is more than what it actually deserves, It is a fiction and imagination is the limit but hey there is a point where you say to yourself it is getting to point of being silly.I expected much more."
1744,"Okay after reading such amazing reviews for this film.I came to see this Film with anticipation that it will top all of the mcu movies,but for me honestly I think Infinity War is a better movie.But that doesn't mean it's bad,I think you just don't have to hype things and left dissapointed , but I was never dissapointed.This movie has a problem on pacing, it was slow and it looks boring, but hey! I was never bored because that is what this movie needs.Slow pacing and build up to an 2nd act and 3rd act of insanity.The characters are not just characters they are very human here ,so vulnerable and full of mixed emotions. The action scenes were really good and this movie is just pure enjoyment and will easily be in my top 5 favorite mcu movies but not better as Infinity War in terms of being a movie.(for me)and surprisingly Captain Marvel is better here than in her own solo movie and this movie is more emotional than Infinity War.Because two movies are presenting different emotions for it's audience to feel.This movie is such a beautiful experience."
1745,"Come on people.
Why is every Marvel movie so overrated?
I rate them as what they deserve. Infinity War was pretty much the only outstanding movie in the franchise. They did something what noone dared before. That was a very good movie.This one? 7 at best. How on Earth can anyone just a little bit of brain rate this higher over movies Inception, Matrix, Goodfellas, etc almost the whole top250 movies. Are you mad? For real..This one was full of nonsense. They basicly setup something that shows and tells you who's how strong. When they show in the end of Infinity War that Thor now can beat Thanos easily, then how comes that he still has all the power but Thanos now can rip him apart without a single stone.Glad it is finally ended. Sick of seeing every trash being in the top250 because of little fan boys that haven't even seen sh**."
1746,I don't think was grt it was ok but won't watch again shame too
1747,"There must be a lot of brainless fan boys highly rating this movie ... compared to its predecessor (Infinity War) Endgame was a real let down.
I won't reveal spoilers. But I will say the pacing was very bad.... very very slow at the start to the point I was nodding off in the theatre .... the movie before had great pacing of action, drama and comedy...... Endgames first half was just boring.
Also balance of heroes in the first movie was done much better than this movie which really should have been called Captain America & Iron Man + Avengers.
And time travel as a plot device is a very lazy way of solving issues ... I cringed when that came up ........ Thanos and his lieutenants were a threat in Infinity War... in this movie they felt really dumbed down."
1748,"Avengers Endgame is the epic conclusion to infinity saga and the final chapter to a 22 movie franchise. We of course have to give credit to the Russo Brothers for directed not only this movie but also Avengers Infinity War (2018) , Captain America the Winter Soldier (2014) and Captain America Civil War (2016). After the snap by the Mad Titan Thanos who is perfectly played by Josh Brolin and the Avengers must restore the damage and defeat Thanos once and for all. This movie also wrapped up some character arcs like Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr). But with all of these Pros there are Cons. One of them is how they handled the character Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) who has no personality no character arc or development. All we know about her is that she is overpowered and gives a little smirk when she give a clever remark. I get it they just introduced her but come on at least give her some more screen, she was in the first ten minutes and then doesn't show up until the last 20 minutes to beat the crap out of thanos and his army. Another issue is how they handled Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Like I understand that Thor is depressed and blames himself for the snap but seriously that doesn't mean he becomes an alcoholic, lazy,fat guy who plays Fortnite. It ruins how they portrayed Thor in Thor Ragnarok (2017) and in Infinity War (2018). One good good thing about Endgame is the fan service in the movie such as all the references to the other MCU movies such as the first Avengers (2012), Doctor Strange (2016), Guardians of the galaxy (2014), Thor the Dark World (2013), Avengers Infinity War (2018), Captain America the first Avengers (2011) and Captain America the Winter Soldier (2014). I also enjoyed how they gave the underdeveloped character such as Nebula, War Machine and Hawkeye, especially Nebula who develops a friendship with War Machine and we feel for her as she used to be a minor character but now played a important role and has the spotlight in some scenes. We now we finally get to best scene in not only this movie but also the entire MCU. The final battle with all the heroes vs Thanos army where everyone has their moment to shine like when Scarlet Witch fight Thanos and breaks his sword, when spiderman activate instant kill, when Iron man and Pepper Fight together and of course when Captain America finally wields Mjolnir and absolutely beats thanos down and all of this leads to the saddest scene in all of the MCU, Iron Man's death scene which made even the toughest of men cry. This movie is will go down as the best movie of the decade and any more years to come."
1749,The movie was ok. Not good. Not bad. Just ok. All the fanboys out there giving this an average rating of 9.1 haven't seen a 9/10 movie ever or simply vote this up this high because they haven't been cuddled enough as a kid or something.The story was what bugged me the most. It wasn't exciting at all. Never once did I think ok this is a bad moment to go to the toilet or something. It really was that dull.This is like the new star wars movies. Made for children who don't care about the plot and just want to see action and by now boring jokes.
1750,"The movie was great, there's no doubt about it, but that was it. Coming off the shock value that Infinity War brought meant that nothing in this film surprised me, actually there really wasn't any surprises- everything was just as you'd expect it, which was slightly disappointing in itself. I remember after infinity war, people in the cinema were speechless, crying, sobbing, hugging each other - there was nothing like that here. I wish there were more surprises. It was also a little slow overall but at the same time a good celebration of the last 11 years."
1751,I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie
1752,"This is without doubt my favourite Avengers movie. I've enjoyed every moment of this highly anticipated final installment. It was the end of an era and we got goosebump moments and a heartbreaking death-scene. There's nothing more to say than you've got to watch it!
I love you 3000!"
1753,"Watching this movie I imagine screenwriters struggling to write decent scenes while the producers demand a grand, comic-book-style finale to satisfy every fan of every Avenger character. The result apparently succeeds in thrilling long-term Marvel Universe fans. For the rest of us this is a bewildering and mostly tedious mix of melodrama and overwrought FX actionI have watched, and often enjoyed, the previous films from the Marvel Cinematic franchise. So I'm familiar with the backstory of the characters. And I know to come to these movies prepared not only to suspend critical thinking but also to let my eyes glaze over during the prolonged action scenes. To the extent I was able to do this for 3 hours I was rewarded with enough situation comedy to keep me in my seat.But the melodramatic angst of the characters in the context of the plot is just irritating. Are you pining over the fact that your buddy might not survive the effort to resurrect the half of the living universe wiped out in Infinity War? Do you and every Avenger suffer from Borderline Personality Disorder?The only protagonists that hold my sympathy and respect for ""keeping it real"" are Tony Stark and Thor. (I'm not sure who merits more credit for that: their actors or their writers.) Otherwise I actually found myself rooting for Thanos: Though we may disagree with his objectives, at least he thinks big and doesn't indulge in ennui. He hews to his principles and does not hesitate to sacrifice himself for them. He is the only true hero in this movie, which makes it a tragedy."
1754,Avengers endgame one of the most anticipated movies of 2019 was watchable. The story was way too predictable except the ending. Movie contains some of the best VFX graphics well it's Marvel. The performances of the actors is also very brilliant. MCU fans won't want to miss it.
1755,"Let me tell you, i love the avengers, i really do. People all around me praise how good it was, and how my friends said that it was a masterpiece and deserved a 10/10. But me? I don't think so. I think personally, it is wat to shoved. Time travel? Really? it is not really a solution tbh, and oh, there are also too many plot holes. The pacing is also way too damn slow, and it can get boring, at least for me. The action is great, but it is mostly time travel stuff. It ain't linear, so it may confuse some of you, especially myself. I just like infinity war better. Straight to the point, full of action and emotions. One of the things that i like about this movie is the ending with captain America getting old, enjoying his life. Really nice touch ngl. but this movie is an epic conclusion nonetheless. I would personally recommend to any hero fans, but may not for some who does not want stuff like i just pointed out."
1756,"First of it will remove your stress if you are thinking about what will be the next or what will thanos do. That's it. Beside that, this movie is almost like crap. Sometimes they want to be serious, sometimes funny, sometimes emotional. What a mess. They had created a hype by Infinity War and now break all the records. I think all credit goes to Infinity war. They should have to take time to write a good screenplay. I guess they don't take time because the hype will be damaged. And now give the people a crap."
1757,"I honestly have no idea what all the hype was about. The movie was so predictable and this is coming from a guy who loves Marvel and was excited for it myself.
I predicted Black Widow's death and Iron Man's death straight away before they even died.
To me the best Marvel was Spider Man into the Spider-verse.
This movie DOES NOT reach my likings and I am a movie expert!
Thank You."
1758,"I am so disappointed. The first hour was incredibly boring and i wanted to leave the theatre. Everyone is trying to convince main characters like iron man and thor how important it is to fight back!!!! Really? are you guys serious? takes time to convince them? and what happened to Captain Marvel? was she really in the film? She comes and the very end because she is busy with other planets!!! what a reason...the real war is on earth and she is not there,,, what an anticlimax...it is all crap and the writers tried to make something when they actually destroyed the film at the very beginning... Infitinity War was way better and thats why i went to see endgame."
1759,"I am with MCU since day one. Huge fan. Watched everything multiple times. And I'm disappointed. I left cinema mad at myself for how much I dislike it. It was familiar feeling for me. I've felt the same after AoU. It was too long, sometimes pretty boring. But come on! They nailed professor Hulk, Cap whispering Hail Hydra, Ant-Man being Ant-Man, coolest decapitation scene in PG13 history. It was like 3 different movies mashed up into one. Endgame feel overcooked and could be way better. I mean Tony's death was totally unnescessary kinda like Pietro's. He should die in battle not by suicide. And Carol Danvers is so terrible I can't bare looking at her cocky face, total miscast and we are gonna live for I don't know how many movies with her, Gal Gadot is the superhero all young women should look up to. To sum up my first review 'cause I feel like MC Gets Side-Tracked Easily, I need to say that it could be a lot better."
1760,"My initial reaction coming out of the theatre was of great satisfaction and little sadness (black widow and iron man deaths). But as I gave more thought to the movie, I felt it could have been taken in a very different direction.The time travel plan was good and I enjoyed the time travel scenes, but left me with a glaring question.....Wouldn't retrieving the stones from the past completely erase the Infinity War timeline as Thanos wouldn't be able to find the stones in the past??.....which means there was no snap and everybody just survived?? Also wouldn't it erase the present timeline of this movie and give rise to an entirely new timeline??In my opinion, 5 years was too much of a gap, instead 1 year at the most would be more appropriate. Two reasons for this: 1. People move on with life in 5 years. 2. 5 years is too much of a time to avenge for the Earths Mightiest Heroes.My other gripe is when Iron man wears his gauntlet with the infinity stones, how can he survive that?? A normal human cannot even survive holding just the power stone by itself. In my opinion it should have been either Captain Marvel or Thor or may be even Captain America (as he's a superhuman) weikding Tony's gauntlet with the infity stones.Overall the movie ends up as a fun movie with great fan service as it touches upon the past movies and characters in a great culmination of 22 movies. I would even watch it multiple times but secretly would wish it was remade with Iron man surviving the end."
1761,"First of all I haven't seen the movie on IMAX or 3d format, I have seen it on 2D. I wish could have experienced in on IMAX because the movie has been shot entirely with IMAX cameras. Endgame's plot doesn't work for me all the time travel thing was messy. It can be suitable for comics but cinematic universe should has been different. First hour of the movie was slow, it could be shortened but I like first hour because it showed us heroes struggles and their human side for example, Cap was in a therapy group and iron man's relationship with his daughter. when the movie approaches the end it dragges you so 3 hours long doesn't bother you. on the other hand, I can't say that Endgame is better than Infinity war or vice versa. Both movies have their own moments I think Endgame's emotional tone was better but Infinity war's humor and battle scenes were better. I feel disappointed final battle of Endgame it was concluded too quickly Russo brothers' battle scenes in Civil war and Infinity war were better than Endgame. I was very angry with absence of Hulk Infinity war but I liked him in in this movie and I also liked Thor and Rocket too. Lastly, I am pleased Iron man and Cap's endings and also widow's their fates in the movie was very emotional. Although, its ridiculous time-travel plot it has its own moments completes 22 films's integrated saga. I give 7 point out of 10."
1762,"Movie is full of action, but even for that I wait last 30 min when the movie Will be over, cause it didn't have hype to keep me exciting. Characters are great written. Some Characters as Thor and Hulk are much different that we been seen them before. Fight scenes and acting are better in Infinity war.For example:when Thor come in Wakanda in Infinity war. Story line is great, but have some gaps. In this movie Cap. American and Iron man are in front plan. In this movie Thor is so so different and almost act like a girl. This is to big turn over for such musculine and strongest character of all Avengers.on moment it looks like this is Cap America or Iron man movie.
I expect much more after media advertising."
1763,"I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.If anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws."
1764,This movie was awesome. It showed how much we need people who can inspire us and how to win battles. Congrats to all the people involved in the project and RIP Chadwick Boseman. I am shocked to hear that he is dead. I wish his family to be strong.
1765,"I was in tears when it was all over, so many years and so much energy put into this saga and I just loved it all."
1766,"I loved this movie. The only thing I was disappointed in was the portrayal of the Hulk and how he never got his revenge on Thanos. Professor Hulk is weak and corny. Other than that, I loved Fat Thor. I was super excited when Captain America picked up Thor's Hammer and used it against Thanos and loved how they showed how Strong Thanos really is by fighting and pretty much destroying Iron Man, Captain America and Thor all at the the same time. Not a fan of Captain Marvel and was happy to see Thanos crack her good. Lol"
1767,"For me the movie felt different than other marvel movies. The pace was slower overall. Cannot say I was fully entertained thoughout the entire movie. Trying to give all the characters an adequate screentime and development made this movie so long and wasnt benefical for the tension. It felt really stretched at some points.Thor is literally a joke in this movie. One of the most developed and powerful characters we have seen in the past. Would have expected him to beat the **** out of thanos and his troops, but he was pretty much useless in retrospective. Instead we have Captain Marvel that outshines the other characters powers by far, plus no one wants to see this because she is just flat and unappealing.I also expected more of Thanos, his sudden change of mind wasnt very relatable after the determined / balanced seeming Thanos weve seen in the previous movie. Some things just felt underwhelming about this movie."
1768,"That's it, not even a drop of sense on this one. They completely ruined Thanos Hulk and Thor and after that they dug a hole so deep and had no idea what to do with it. I don't even want to write anymore because the more I think the worse it gets.. they rushed this one too fast. With so many possibilities to do it, it's really sad to end an era like this."
1769,It was pk but much much to long. Infinity Wars was alot better. Iron man dying was a but to dramatic. I should have waited to come out on Firestick but since I just spent $5 and change was t that great a loss just my time. You have been warned.
1770,"To describe it in one word - BORING. No real emotional pull from the vanishing in infinity war and any attempt to, was handled poorly. The opening Hawkeye scene a perfect example The first 45 minutes really plods.The main plot, when we finally get to it, might leave you cringing as will the character assassination of Thor and Hulk - silliness taken a step too far.
Some huge inconsistencies in the story too that really irked me, like one throw of the Storm-breaker piercing Thanos despite wearing the gauntlet in infinity, to being powerless to stop him when he is without the gauntlet?!!! And the ending, why didn't they use the time stone to stop the invasion and ensure no avengers die?!!! And how come Hawkeye could handle an infinity stone when it nearly shredded all the guardians in vol 1?!! The end fight scene was boring and poorly choreographed. Overall, I think the russo's ran out of ideas and were overwhelmed with the task of bringing the various storylines and characters together. A shame it ended so shambolically, I had hoped and expected so much more."
1771,"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed.
During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films."
1772,"Man, I was so bored watching this. Cringeworthy moments scattered profusely along the timeline, stupid plot and like a whole 30 minutes of action.If I was in the mood for melodrama, I'd watch ""gone with the wind"", thank You very much.First half of the movie they ""assemble"", then jump in time here and there, finally we get some epic battle (like a reprise from IW), then ""emotional"" ending dragging forever.Now I understand, why they were so afraid of the spoilers. Seriously - the way people were hyped up and got THIS garbage in the end borders on criminal."
1773,"Why did they make Thor fat, stupid and weak! They begin by trying to show how the tragedy and trauma affected Hawkeye- yet you didn't really feel anything. It just jumped forward. There was not enough discussion or process dedicated to how the Hulk resolved his problem of Infinity war. He just talks now.
Captain marvel has a few moments. There are no celestials, Kronos, Death, the Watcher, Eternity, Galactus or mention of them.
Adam Warlock was hinted at the end of credits of Guardians of the Galaxy 2- yet he has never been mentioned again.
Captain American is all of a sudden able to summon Mjölnir for no reason, or explanation.
Pepper just shows up in a suit and knows how to weild it.
The battle ends too easily as well."
1774,"Dont get me wrong, i know 99% of the reviews are from marvel/avengers fans but hey im not blame you all youre are blind and marketing from producers swept you down. Let me see - opening was perfect but suddenly half of the movie is boring, cheaply dark, second part of the movie is too chaotic. Movie trashes other truly legendary films about their non logical sory but here is seemingly everything logical ? LOL ... I could name like 6 very stupid/ilogical/boring things but hey, whats the point. Im just glad all the avengers nonsense ended. I liked Infinity War for its adult-ish story, dark/serious tone, nice and attractive story but here producers knew that EVERYTHING goes and NOTHING will be criticised from die hard fans.. Even if the movie was bad in 50% of the avengers fan, still everybody from you would love it.. Producers have the luck that this franchise is very very solid in terms of acceptance..
For neutral fan like me ? theres HUGE gap between Infinity War and Endgame."
1775,"Endgame is filled with emotions, great scenes, beautiful cinematograhpy, and above all else; fantastic entertainment! This is what u would expect from a great superhero movie - so many great moments and wonderful send-offs to some characters.
Still I was not sold. I have a few nit-picks, but will ignore those for the big objections that brings the score down. But first the positives.This is the best most crowd pleasing Avengers movie yet, and as already mention; this movie is so beautiful to watch. The action fantastic! All the characters are great, but Iron Man, Black widow and cap america have absolutely stunning performances. Almost everything about this movie is top, top, top!Still, I will only give it a 2/10, which is actually generous. Let me tell you why.First, Thanos. Almost a full movie dedicated to this villain now and we know almost nothing about him. He wants to kill half the universe because... ???What drives him? Why collecting his ""children""? He is dangerous, strong, and the biggest foe, but who is he? I was hoping some would be explained, but no. They instead make him more comical evil in this movie, why?Time travel sucks. No matter how good explanations are or what u do with it, time travel creates paradoxes, lingering questions, plot holes, and in this movie it creates evil Steve..Speaking of; Captain America is evil! Yes, in this movie he rips poor peggy from her husband and children so Cap can get laid. Horrible ending of the movie!Fat lazy Thor, and another dumb usage of Hulk, Loki! And that stupid girl power pose... oh God that was so cringe. I loved Cap Marvel movie, but here she is a deus ex machina - how did she fly that ship millions of light years without Tony dying? 2sec? Really?The more I think of the movie the lower my score becomes. I started with 7/10 just after seeing it, now I have it at 5/10 and Im not seeing it again. Way too many plot holes and major flaws.Edit: Saw it online today, and it is really badly put together movie. Got even more disappointed, so I will lower the score again to 4/10. I cannot go lower though since I have Wonder Woman on the same score, and Endgame is not worse than WW so I will keep it there. So, so disappointed... how could the Russo´s make such a bad movie? What happen?Edit2: After re-watching the fantastic Captain Marvel, which is one of if not the best superhero movie ever made, I decided to watch this trash again and I now believe Endgame to be one of the worst superhero movies ever made. It is not JL or BvS bad, but not far from it. Lowered the score to 2/10.
This movie suck, and anyone claiming this is a good movie is a moron."
1776,"This story-arc wrap-up starts with half the Avengers and world in general dead and no way to fix it. Only of course they figure out a way, because that was telegraphed in the last movie, and some of that goes right and some horribly wrong leading to, yet again, a massive battle.The movie is generally speaking as entertaining as the last one, although it's attempt to use it's time-travel conceit to include every single character from every cinematic marvel universe movie ever made can be wearying, with characters I don't quite remember, characters appearing too briefly to make an impact, and a tremendous number of non-speaking cameos that serve no purpose except to let the audience say, ""oh yeah, them.""The first half is pretty zippy, with lots of banter and some flat-out slapstick. But the movie also wants to delve into the self-sacrifice theme, so the movie drifts into increasing levels of sorrow.The movie ends, obviously, with a vast battle, and while it's quite good, with some serious ""wow"" moments, it is the smaller, character-driven moments that truly stand out, like two superheroes battling each other to be the one to self-sacrifice. And while the post-battle weep-fest seems a bit long, the film does end with a particularly satisfying resolution to one superhero's arc.Endgame gives you the solid, expected Avengers experience. Comedic, dramatic, special-effects driven, and overlong. It's well worth seeing even though ultimately it's nothing you haven't seen before."
1777,"Avengers End GameSo after twelve months of fan theories and speculation we finally get to see what happens to our surviving heroes after the events of Infinity war.
End game isn't just a conclusion to that movie but to all the movies from the Marvel cinematic universe.
This is a tall order for Directors the Russo brothers but boy have they nailed it!
End game is a sombre affair as you'd expect after half of all living creatures have been wiped out of the universe.
Essentially a movie that is spit into three defining acts.
The first showing the aftermath of Thanos's actions.
The second act is devoted to the surviving Avengers desperately trying to fight back (delivering fan service by the bucket load) before a satisfying conclusion that will have everyone on the edge of their seat.
End game may not ultimately thrill in the same way as Infinity War did but this final chapter is riveting from a storytelling point of view. It's a much deeper movie than its predecessor.
Only when revisiting Infinity War after End Game do you fully appreciate the amount of creativity that's gone into making both movies.
How the Russo brothers have managed to weave every story and character arc together is commendable.
Trying to decide which movie is best is difficult because I see them as one big five hour masterpiece rather than two separate movies.
I'm trying to remain vague here as I don't want to spoil anything for those who haven't yet seen the film.
Just as an insurance policy I've declared that this review may contain spoilers.
What I can divulge is that End Game is three hours of your life that you will be fully immersed and ultimately enjoy.
The lengthy runtime will fly by unnoticed.
Despite the sombre tone there's humour in this film.
The script writers employed by the MCU
are experts in creating witty dialogue and even though this film is serious it boasts more belly laughs than some intentional comedies.
The humour doesn't detract from what's at stake, rather it allows the audience a break from the building tension. Stakes are indeed high and all through the film there's a nagging doubt that The Avengers may actually fail.
It's refreshing that both this movie and its predecessor make believe that the bad guys can win.
Just like in real life there's not always a happy ending.
But after the events of Infinity War the good guys and the audience need that payoff.
Will it come? Well that's something you will have to find out for yourselves.
It's no spoiler to say there will be sacrifices along the way and the MCU will take a different path in the future.
End game is indeed an epic conclusion to all the hours of movies you have invested in up to this point.
It is of course a splendid technical achievement in terms of film making.
The nostalgic second act proves this.
Like its predecessor Infinity War, End Game will get even better with multiple revisits.
Definitely a film that I'm excited to see again."
1778,"The climax that all fans deserve. Marvel still pulls out surprises that you couldn't dream of, allowing this to earn a spot anongst some of the greatest films made. The length yields an utterly satisfying scene, but honours the 11 years of the studio with the perfect ending."
1779,"I really liked all of previous Marvel films, but this one was a huuuge disappointment. More than half of the film was really boring, in fact nothing happened. Fight scenes looked like made by 10-year-old Marvel fan. All of the film seemed to be made out of fan theories and dad jokes. I'm sad because it's the end of this Marvel era and this wasn't the final I was expecting."
1780,Just bad a lot of things don't ad up cap America swinging Thors hamer like he's the God of thunder they sell out on Thors character just to be funny what actually was a bit the only funny part in the movie the hulk okay he changed good for him and a couple other things like this I feel like they just put a boring 180 min movie togetter cause they will sell tickets anyway it's a whole build up for a climax in the movie that only last 15 min and it has realy no surprises they use more parts of old movies then they actually made a movie and yes time travel.................. Just like hey lets go back do it differently and let's win??? I'm a big movie enthusiast but I won't go to the theaters for a marvel movie again.
1781,"Enjoyed the movie, I am a huge fan of the MCU, and have been since day 1. But this movie was ruined by Thor being fat and so stupid. There was no need for the mcu to make him like that. He's been getting stronger and stronger in every movie, but this one completely ruins him and everything that he is about. If they were going to make Thor that way, they should have just killed him off when Loki and heimdall were killed. And then cap picks up Mjolnir, Yes he is worthy but it's just just not right.. ( maybe I feel like this because I am a massive fan of Thor )."
1782,I can't believe I wasted 3 hours of my life on this movie
1783,"I'm fc marvel but over all is so normal... i laughing when i saw it's score. It so much more than quality.
This is power of fc.it not fair end game should get lower than 7. Only me just 6 but i gave 4 because it not fait for another movies in 2019"
1784,"Characters -Iron Man: needn't have been killed... Atrocious
Cap: Why did you have to make em old? Ridiculous.. and Cap growing old is contradictory to the rule explained by Dr. Hulk Banner (Yuck!) When he was helping build the time machine
Thor: don't even get me started.. biggest let down.. such a shame
Hulk: Agrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!! Shown as a big softie... Not cool..Story: looks like the writes got themselves in a bit of a tangle and time travel was the only way out.. and why the hell was this shot as a funny movie? Especially after watching Infinity Wars, making it so funny is ridiculous...Clearly MCU wants to move to the next phase without the core (RDJ, Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo) so why not just retire them, rather than insulting them like this.Overall: they have messed up the last 10 years of my life with such a shameful tribute and send-off...4 stars cos of the history I have with the franchise it was 2 star otherwise"
1785,"Mediocre
Revamp of old stuff, waste of time, okay ending."
1786,"It is a great movie, 3 great hours, but not great acting, there is no acting, just super heros costumes"
1787,"Then it wouldn't be rated as high. 3 hours was stretched, there was too many ""motivational quote"" moments and they forced a lot of the jokes. Other than that, the acting was good from the main cast and the point when they encounter one another was fantastically done."
1788,"I had such big expectations for this movie and i was so anxious to see it that in the past two weeks i kept dreaming and thinking about it every day. But, unfortunetly, the movie dissapointed me pretty much. I really like the Ruso brothers and they have had great imagination and are good at what they do, but this movie was casted and filmed in a hurry with little to almost no action at all and lack of inspiration and imagination. They could have done a much better job with the Endgame movie but i guess that is what happens when you rush to make even more money and don't care much about the fans.
Hope they make it up to us with their next movie."
1789,I hated it when iron Man dies just because they wanted to emotional end they killed him 😠😠😠😠😠😠
1790,"The beginning............is absolute genius. The opening scene draws you in emotionally and gives you the true hatred for Thanos that you need in order to watch this movie. The rest of the movie erases that. If you think about this plot critically, there is no reason for the ending to be the way that it is.For the average fan, this movie is incredible. Not only does every character get their shining moment, but every moment you want as a casual fan, a CASUAL fan, happens for the first 2hr 40mins. The last 21 minutes however are lackluster. There is a LOT of fan-servicing.This movie however, is filled with plot holes that any critically thinking fan can see and loathe about. Not only are key mechanics not explained with any clarity, but they completely defy literally any concept of them that the human race of today have theorized about. The Russos simply write what they want into the storyline to make things work in their favor and that is that.SPOILER-SPOILER:

Tony's funeral is completely glazed over. I almost teared up when Pepper said her goodbye. But how do you not show a ceremony for his body? A STATUE maybe? This is THE foundation of the MCU thus far, cinematically, and you give CAP the glory of standing up to Thanos' armies by himself in the end? The Russo brothers blindly idolize Cap as an invulnerable super-human who can take any blow and get back up. Give me a reason for this.Captain Marvel is a badass for 3 minutes of the movie, and back-handed the next.Not to mention the Thanos that they fight in the end is not the Thanos that we've grown to hate. The Thanos we've grown to hate has killed trillions. He dies. The Thanos we get has not *snapped* yet, but the Russo brothers need a severed head to serve to fanboys.Why return the stones afterwards? Not only are you releasing the stones into other timelines and allowing for those timelines to create the Thanos we hated in Infinity War, but you're allowing your own timeline to be affected like the one's you manipulated the stones from. Not to mention the fact that Loki taking the stone and escaping in 2013 while having Cap and Tony go back in time WITHIN that separate timeline messed up further timelines. Are we to believe that the Avenger's are justified in ruining other timelines in order to fix their own?Why can't Thor speak to his mother about future events if she already knows that Thor in Endgame is in fact from the future. She know of future events but doesn't know about her incoming death? The movie's own logic explained that conversing with people in other timelines could ruin that timeline, yet not affect your timeline's future. With that said, why not just have Thor inform his mother of her death? This would not affect his timeline but allow Thor in the other timeline to have a mother. UGHThis movie is good for casual fans. This movie is a sub-5 rating for critical-thinking individuals. I only give this a 6 for the Russo brothers successfully drawing my attention away from fat Thor in the end and instilling that heroes with unideal bodies can be super too."
1791,"Am I the only one to think that the movie is bad and IW is far better? Personally, I expected Thanos to be defeated in the bloodiest way possible, which appeared to not be the case. Seeing how endgame goes pretty much wasted Thanos's character and strength. We didn't get to see Thanos kill anyone or fight the Avengers with his full strength. I mean, he's the villain Marvel's been working on so much so it'd be a waste just to see him perform like he did in the movie.Also, the way they messed with the timeline didn't seem to make a lot sense to me. They took every infinity stone from the past to the future in a strange way where they actually fought and had conversations with some of their past lives. Tbh, that leads to a confusion and a lot of questions regarding how the timeline will go on as a result of the additional moments that took place.Overall, I don't really like this movie. It's too predictable. I feel like it should've been a lot darker and bloodier, especially in the final battle. I was hoping for Thanos to kill multiple characters(even though he killed half of everyone in IW), something that will trigger massive rage in the Avengers and tense feelings within the audience during the battle scenes. I've been a big fan of the MCU and I expected this movie to be much more epic. Just like any other movies made by the Russo brothers, it's not bad but it could've been way better."
1792,"After Infinity war I had very high expectations, and boy I was wrong.Don't get me wrong, the movie is 'watchable' but far on quality and energy from the previous one.P.S - if you are hulk fan (like me!) get ready to be disappointed even more. Do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie."
1793,"Three words to describe the methodology inherent in destroying a franchise - or any story for that matter. For all the intrigue, conjecture, speculation, and cosmic potential Endgame enjoyed long before its release - and might have included - they opted for the least fascinating and pedestrian of stories: when it all else fails, just go back in time and change it! I do not mind heavy CGI movies with no substance; they're entertaining from a technical perspective, and when a decent story props it up, at least there exists some satisfaction. That said, with Infinity War, there was great possibility. I'm not going to bother with a detailed review here ... this movie was wrong ... all those richly detailed characters, all those amazing back stories, all that simmering creativity, all that ingenuity and inspiration totally and utterly wasted. I gave it 4 Stars just because it's nice to end the misery, but it is difficult to appreciation the wastefulness. Sad really."
1794,"No spoilers.The movie had a nice closing of the past 10 years but is far from the best Marvel movie which I had hoped for.Infinity war is head and shoulders above it due to its high pace and perfect character combinations. Endgame is funny, emotional and provides more depth to main character heroes. However, leaves so many important things out of focus despite its 3 hour runtime. Also, surprisngly feels like the Russos missed many great opportunities to make the movie better.Go and see it! Still important piece if the puzzle."
1795,"Just watched the movie. Despite my best wishes, I simply cannot find myself singing praises to such a poorly-done movie. Ranging from the grossly obvious CGI to the poorly written-out story line, Endgame is extremely underwhelming. Throughout the movie I found myself sitting in utter disbelief as to how Endgame went so wrong after a fantastic Infinity War."
1796,It made a lot of money and that's this concludes my review
1797,"It's so well put together and emotional that anything that the film does badly is simply superfluous. The acting is spot on, the humor is good but not over the top. It wraps everything up so nicely, and the emotional moments make you feel. Iron Man dying had me in tears with his ""proof that tony stark had a heart"" floating across his lake. Captain America choosing to go back to his love in the 40s was gut wrenching. Everything was tied up, and it does feel like the end of an era in cinema. There will still be Marvel superhero movies. There still be heroes to look to. But new names will be taking up the mantle. It won't be the same, but not necessarily in a bad way. It will be just different. The end of the movie really hits you with how much these characters have changed in the last 10 year and 23 movies, and how things are different now. At first I thought the time travel narrative would be incredibly hokey, but it was so well done you can't help but give it credit. It's the most interesting use of time travel in a movie in a long time. Everything has been wrapped up. The only loose end is Loki and where be went while they were back in time. I guess time will tell."
1798,"Its sad to see it come to an end. But im satisfied by how it ended and how the story went through.
With the usual expected sense of humor in marvels movies and a good story line."
1799,"It doesn't feel long Every scene is very well thought but I expected a more serious and darker tone after what happened in ending of the previous movie. 1/3 of the movie is spent on giving new layers to characters, but after Ant-Man appears it becomes a silly movie targeted to teens. The solemn tone of the movie disappears without a proper transition. After that everything is messy and convoluted. It's not bad and they had a lot to include but they could avoid the journey through the past movies and use the time on depeloping and giving a proper conlcution to a 10 year saga."
1800,"Though the movie is decent, it in no way compares to Infinity War which was at least twice as good. This movie had two hours of boredom followed by a great third act. Wish they could of done this for the entire 3 hours vs just the last hour."
1801,"This is my first review ever at IMDB and English is not my first language so please bear with me.I have been a movies geek since my childhood and in my whole life I never watched any movie in cinema, yeah you heard that right. (feeling bad about it).Avengers: Endgame was my first movie I watched in Cinema with my buddy with an extraordinary hyped built after the events of Infinity War, but trust me it lacks the potential like Infinity war built already and also the reviews ( 8.9 ratings seriously) and how much this made money so far is just beyond me. gotta say here, INIFITY WAR was much better. stop trending the hype of Endgame its not that special.because some of the reasons why:1. Hawkeye received way too much screentime, that was just WHAT & Why ?
2. How in the world Cap America was able to pick up THOR's Hammer, they never told us in previous movies or did they ?
3. They literally destroyed THOR's & HULK's charisma by changing their conditions, if you know what I mean. I just kept waiting till the end to see both in the shape again but that never happen sadly.
4. Wanda maximoff with that much power lol just lol
5. That going back to past and future stuff was really confusing and not satisfying imo.
6. The ending fight scenes were really disappointing they could've done the better way.I would say INFINITY WAR was classic specially the way they portrayed THANOS devilish personality & how genius he was but in Endgame it was nothing like that, they failed him for purpose.Otherwise the movie score and that CGI in the ending battle was top notch.P.s : I don't wanna hurt Fans feelings I am just devastatingly disappointed."
1802,"I was expecting this movie for a long time and i was sure that since the last 3 avengers movies were good ,that this one will be the best , they even compared it to dark knight... but no, itt wasn't. The flow of the movie was very slow and uneven, 2 whole hours introduction for 30min of action and suspnce.. when the action finaly came i couldnt even be excited.They tried to create emotions, but you can't force that ,when yoou devote your 2 first hours to nothing. It has soem great scenes and it wasn't so awful but i excpected much more from the closing movie of avengers with not so many plot holes..."
1803,"It was a great conclusion to the Infinity saga but it lacked effectiveness for neutrals like myself. Only true fans will reap the full benefits of Avengers Endgame especially if they decide to look past the senselessness and predictability of the movie.Memorable moments are guranteed, however for neutrals this will be one of Marvel's most dissapointing films. It doesn't live up to the hype and it's way too predictable. Too many jokes, just the right amount of drama but not enough action.The best moments are the ones that make this movie slightly worth watching. If I had a blu ray of this movie I would skip to the most important moments because most of the film is pretty predictable and not very entertaining.Overall it was a good movie, but not one worth watching again.Spoiler : There is no post credit scene."
1804,"Honestly: at the 2 hour mark i was checking my watch to try and figure out how much more I had to put up with before it made sense.
The storyline was sporadic, and bounced around so much that it just got confusing and boring.
I have no intent, nor interest, to watch it again"
1805,In my opinion this was a huge dissappointment for me. The movie lacks of action and full of irrational content. Its very slow and boring. First half was unnecessary and second half is below par. Im so sad that nearly nothing significant happened in whole 180 minutes. I was expecting the same vibe as infinity war or dark knight but this was more like age of ultron.
1806,"Believe it or not, I expected this storyline. That Thanos would destroy the stones and Avengers will move on until they find a way to travel back in time. I said I hope it wasn't using Quantum realm because it would be repeatable. And that's exactly what happened.The movie is plagued by plot holes. I will not go over all of them but I spent over an hour after the movie listing all the plot holes to my daughter. The biggest and the most ridiculous one is that the Avengers had only enough Pym particles for one round trip each. Movie made a big deal about this. But towards the end, Thanos uses one vial of Pym particle on his ship with everyone on board. With thousands of minion creatures on it. With no special ""Quantum"" suit or equipment. You mean to tell me Avengers could've just got on a vehicle and teleport all together with one vial? And with Hank Pym back now, they can time travel at will from now on. Or go back in time to get more just like they did in the movie. This completely ruins the Marvel Universe.Avengers can travel back in time where they first made the Ironman version of Infinity Gauntlet. Borrow it, defeat any villain with a snap, and return it to exact moment. Avengers of the past will understand since they did same thing when retrieving the stones.Also now everyone is Antman. Everyone can shrink, go to Quantum realm, and time travel. Nothing special about Antman now. These are just fraction of all the plot holes.There also was a huge plot hole fail in The Last Jedi when Holdo sliced Snoke's mothership by going lightspeed. Which ruined the Star Wars Universe. And these rivals that plot hole.Their version of time travel is a big mess too. It says past and future is not connected and changing past doesn't effect future but there are parts where it shows the new past effecting the future. And they were making fun of Back to the Future."
1807,"Seriously, this is probably one of the most overhyped movies that I have ever seen in my life, and a part of me wonders whether the MCU can actually survive after this film. Well, from looking at the reviews it seems like it satisfied quite a lot of people, but was it a good movie - well, no, not really. Okay, I enjoyed it, sort of, by the overhyped nature of this film sort of made it somewhat painful to sit through in places, and the three hour length, honestly, it could have simply been cut down somewhat.Look, don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily believe that this is a bad movie, but rather I felt that it was overtly long, overtly hyped, and in parts somewhat dull. As for the acting, well, it was passable, but not great. In fact I felt that Mark Ruffalo really didn't shine anywhere near as much as he did in the previous films.
Yet, the one thing that I'll give it credit for is the depth of the characters, and the fact that Captain Marvel did not dominate the film anywhere near as much as I, and many others, were expecting. The thing is that she popped in at the beginning, and at the end, and that was about it. The main focus of the film was on the three main Avengers from the original series.Yeah, okay, we also had Rocket Racoon playing a major role, and I'll certainly be giving it points for that - I love Rocket Racoon, and I suspect this is why he was brought into this film. In fact, by whittling down a lot of the characters did give it a bit more entertainment value, in that we weren't constantly jumping all over the place, as well as our attention being drawn apart by so many people. Instead we had what could be considered a core number and that was it.Mind you, they completely stuffed up the whole time line thing. You known, with the end part where they appeared to destroy Thanos and his cohorts. Then again, I also suspect that since they had time travelled to get here, they were probably just sent back to their original time line, namely so that we wouldn't end up having a complete Back to the Future style mess.Actually, that is something that I should mention, and that is the Back to the Future references. Yeah, we had a sort of jumping around to other parts of the series and reliving some of the older films. This, in part, made it feel like just one of those clip shows that some series tend to show because they are stuck for a story line. Then again, the clip show elements were rather small, and they ended up creating some interesting side shows, but it still felt like a clip.Oh, and then there was that part right at the beginning - it just happened too fast. After everything they had been through in the previous film, they pretty quickly found Thanos, and lopped his head of. Honestly, where was the master villian that we had seen in the previous film, the one that just seemed to be impossible to beat. Then again, I guess, without the infinity gauntlet, and his thugs, there probably isn't all that much to consider."
1808,"For what it is, it is fine. Enough pew pew pew, smashy smashy and flashy effects and explosions to mindlessly entertain the inner 8 year old.THAT is all that this is. Anybody who thinks this type of media deserves the highest marks is a cultural empty vessel. Anybody who thinks this colourful nonsense should be rated like actual movies with actual content is deluded.Mindless escapism is fine. it just isn't art."
1809,This is the greatest movie I' ever watched!! Amazing work!!🔥🔥👌🏻🎞🙏🏻
1810,"Infinity wars was just epic. The build up from that film is what created so much hype towards endgame. However did endgame really deliver? I dint feel so.Gimmicky Time travel was also messed up, they tried so hard to make the audience buy it, when antman cracked a joke about it not being time travel. when tony stark said he wouldn't do it the first time. this to make the audience root for the plot. The time stone was gone when Thanos destroyed it, even borrowing stones from an alternate dimension would have been a great plot. And with all the intelligence in the marvel universe, humans crack time travel.. really..It was also like the guys were forced into being depressed. We had the heroes of the known universe until that point reporting to black widow? for what joy? and hawkeye, his only action sequences was running, and more running almost every time, but he has to run, your dealing with superheroes and super villains. the point I'm making here is that apart from not so great casting of certain characters, interaction and measurement of power has to be well translated. Anther example is Captain marvel making a guest appearance at the end, being able to over power Thanos while he wields the gauntlet.. Or tony stark taking a punch from Thanos without his headgear. His brains should have splattered. RDJ has a great personality, but the whole saga doesn't have to be about him, your dealing with the Marvel universe.Then you had them going back into separate timelines cooking up their own mini story sequences there, setting the energy of the movie offtrack.I dont know if I am watching the same movie as these guys with 10 stars, or is it just blind loyalty.For me avengers ended with infinity wars, so well done, character build up of Thanos was magnificent, to see him then reduced to a puppet with only sweet philosophy but not such a great death. Would be interested to hear about alternate plots and endings for endgame."
1811,"The culmination of the infinity saga,this movie is going down in history as one of its kind. MIND-BLOWING MASTERPIECE.Words can't describe the grandiosity of this film. Worth watching more than once."
1812,"From a comic fans perspective this may be a good movie, at least the last hour,
but for an admirer of cinema it is a great disappointment. The first two hours are expendable. The Russos try to be schmaltzy like Spielberg and funny like Waititi without having either of their chops and so they fail badly. They may do certain visual things really good but overall it seems to be a too big to succeed idea, to try and tie up every single storyline. I may also add that a lot of really stupid stuff happens that takes you out of the movie. Bad timing of mediocre jokes and some ridiculous mistakes. The pay off for the soapy stuff comes way too late. This is a not a great movie, unfortunately."
1813,"I went in to Avengers: Endgame with high expectations and they were still shattered.First off, nobody is ready for the 3 hours that conclude the Infinity Saga and if you think you are then you're wrong. This is easily the best MCU movie so far and one of the best superhero movies of all time. The visuals are stunning and the cast and crew goes all out to give us the cinematic event of a lifetime.The movie features a strong and engaging plot with directors Anthony and Joe Russo clearly showing us that they know what they're doing. Character arcs across the board come to a satisfying conclusion and just remind us why we, as fans, have invested this much in these films the past 11 years.Bring your tissues, because this is without a doubt the most emotional adventure that Marvel has put us on as an audience. Emotional scenes are backed up by Alan Silvestri's stunningly beautiful and goosebump-inducing soundtrack, with many callbacks to previous MCU movies that prove that this is a worthy conclusion.Incredibly astounding and emotionally affecting end to a saga that started with a billionaire in a cave with a box of scraps and a scrawny kid from Brooklyn who just wanted to do the right thing.Go see this film; you will not regret it at all."
1814,"A lot of useless speech this time. The movie would have ben better if it was two hours long.
Thor, please, Thor...."
1815,"I'm just gonna do a list of things that ruined the movie for me
1.) Fat Thor. Insanely stupid. Ruined the movie for me
2.) captain marvel was in it for 20 minutes after a year of buildup
3.) hulk is now gone forever
4.) a little slow for the first hour, which is so unlike infinity war
5.) Captain America with Thor's hammer, Thor with stormbreaker and Iron Man can't beat Thanos with no infinity stone???"
1816,"Wtf is this?
""The young and the restless"" with professor Hulk and fat Thor?
I understand that this is Hollywood and that americans need to have the Captain America figure alive and kicking but maaan don't spoil a franchise like this with happy-unicorn-everyone-lives-happily-ever-after-ending...
That puny human should've been dead ages ago....But noooo, he can withstand Thanos gauntlet or not ...Fking pathetic. I pity the americans that rated this movie 10/10.
You managed to spoil the entire franchise and I actually feel sorry that I paid money to see the premiere of this movie at he cinema.
I gave it a 5 just for the few seconds in which Thanos wields Stormbreaker ...otherwise I would rate it 1 for the freaking story :(
Absolutely pathetic."
1817,"This film is RI-DI-CULOUS! It's 99% self oriented on men great old hero's Iron Man (poor martyr), captain America, the Archer and Banner. So many drama scenes boring.
No place with such testosterone for Captain Marvel, 5min on 2H.
People don't waist your money!"
1818,Poor character developmenta lot of unnecessary characters that barely have a lineweird pacinglast act was pretty much a reenact of IW where they actually win
1819,"They try to be different but it just doesnt do it for me. I already dislike Infinity war and the first half of this movie confirm my view. The first act of this movie should have been included in the infinity war. And that would make infinity war the perfect movie... Why? Just why are they doing it like this? Cut some unnecessary scene in the infinity war to get that 3 hour screen time and then end the film with Thanos head. We will face the shock of reality that even when they defeat the villain, its not enough. The world already changed. And then start the sequel, 5 year after, with that time travel plot. And rework the movie with a better story, or if you can, just give a brief explaination about the time travel plot so that it didnt resulting in a huge paradox like this. For movie goers the current plot is okayish but for scifi nerd this is unacceptable. The lost of one of the avenger is a pure tearjerk but the other one doesnt make any sense. It could have been done better with a different character.
Overall it is okay for entertainment if you dont think too much about it. But I feel unsatisfied with what they are doing. I really do feel it could be better."
1820,"It was incredible fan-fare. It had really basic and generic music, basic cinematography, basic plot, basic motivations. There was some cool action, but most of it was cut awfully. It was predictable as hell, the jokes were eh, the reveals and climaxes were eh. I knew what was going to happen and when to whom.It was just eh."
1821,"It's way too long. There's way too little fun or humor. Since it's yet-another-time-travel movie, it's not very interesting. Though they try to take a new spin on it (explicitly stating that ""it doesn't work like in Back to the Future""), they end up with the same usual time-travel-silliness. The whole ""multiverse and multi-timelines"" is thus pretty inconsistent and weird. Sure, this is a comic-book movie, things don't make sense, but, still, they should at least be somewhat consistent.We never quite get why this chain of events is the only one out of 5 million that works and why had Dr Strange chosen it.And the whole ""can't undo real deaths, only the Thanos-induced kind-of-deaths"" is not explained (sure, it probably would not make sense anyway, but, still, it's kind of important and they don't even try).Thanos goes full-blown villain, which is not in line with his character.It also doesn't wrap up the story for all of the original Avengers. You kind of get why are the ones that are still here the ""chosen ones"" (clue: this is a business), but, still, it's a ""conclusion of a story that is actually _not_ a conclusion of the whole story"".Even for the ones that are done, their conclusions are not well done, are somewhat cliched, predictable and un-interesting. Iron-Man fairs best here, but, still underwhelming.On the plus side, from a general movie quality, this is better than Infinity War, it's better connected and the pace is better. Taking time-travel-silly aside, the story is OK. Although there a few ""feminism in your face"" moments, it doesn't go overboard.Acting is good enough, but, it could have been better. Some things didn't work, like Hemsworth's take on fat Thor, others were just not very good (ScarJo as the ""no-nonsense leader of the free-decimated-universe"" and Chris Evans' take on Charlie Sheen - like Anger Manager) while the rest were just OK - foremost RDJ. But, the thing is, we've seen these actors do better, it's bad they couldn't do it again.Bottom line, as a kind-of wrap-up for some characters, it's OK, worth a watch. But, on its own or if you're not into the characters that were ""wrapped up"", it's not."
1822,"This was the average superhero movie with an ending everyone expected,its a shame they did this to the best villain ever thanos"
1823,"Average. 1st 2hr you will die. If are till the end, last 45 will satisfy you. It's Captain and Thor show and in the end we missed the Iron Man. Rip"
1824,"I did not expect much of the movie.
Almost fell asleep from boredom."
1825,"Like any other Marvel movie, this one is also very mediocre. If you have watched all the others and are with the HYPE, then you definitely want to watch this. However, keep in mind that this movie is very average. The music is nothing special, camerawork is very normal and the script is very cheesy and predictable.
This movie is also very long and it doesn't have to be.
I will probably forget this movie in a month or two."
1826,"Maybe because I´m an ""over 50 year old European"" (when I look at the votes) but I don´t get it. A cast filled with big names of which have very good resumes.
But this movie gives me the idea: Let´s push 1 more out ""for the team"". A team that seems to be growing with extra superheroes with every sequel.Not a movie I would watch alone, nor with my children who are 27 and 29 years of age. Maybe in 10 years time with my grandchildren but than it´s prolly outdated, like I might be atm. But these cash cow movies don´t do it for me anymore."
1827,"This movie is all That I wanted from a movie for a long time im still on the hypetrain eventhough I am a couple of tv show episodes behind but I try to clear everything up, cant wait until future project."
1828,"Perfect culmination of 11 years of 22 movies in a truly epic movie universe - MCU. After success of Infinity War expetactions for Endgame were very high and there wasn't surprise factor and Marvel srudios managed to pull it out. After IW there were million of questions in the air and this movie answered it all. We all can't get what we want from the ending (for example GoT finale) but for Endgame this wasn't the ending we need but the one we deserve. Every character got enough screen time, expect for Captain Marvel who was hyped for much more, but for sure she had important role and Brie Larson performance before she even knew how her character should do is truly what deserves round of applause. Hulk and Thor characters recieved some backflash from fans but I am very happy to see comic adaptationa of Professor Hulk and King Thor personas. Robert Downey Jr. delivered best performance of his career. There were deep scenes, scenes that left me crying out loud in the cinema, laughing out loud etc. Comedy and tragedy were very well combined and in balance - as all thing should be. Also there were some minor moments that set up the Phase 4 for MCU. Fan service was enjoyable. CGI was amazing and final battle was deserving to be compared to th LotR battle scenes. Plot was amazingly well adjusted, some fans didn't like time travel definition i believe because they didn't understand it, but it is not very hard to understand just pay attention. Also time travel is just a fiction so they can make as many rules as they want. It is a pure 10!"
1829,The worst mcu movie of all time. Don't understand all the hype this movie is getting.
1830,"This could've been sooo much better, some great scenes and then the horrific route taken with the characters of Thor and Hulk! Some nice touches and fight scenes but left disappointed.
Totally agree with so many others that infinity war was the better movie."
1831,"The film starts to fall apart the more you think about it, but the conclusion to so many wonderful decade-spanning character arcs are so incredibly satisfying. There's so much to like about this film."
1832,"This film is not as good as many of the other Marvel movies (and certainly not the 'great' film reviewers are saying it is). It started off VERY slowly / took a while to get going. HATED what they did with Thor's character - making him a fat, lazy drunk. And I really think they should have killed off Hawkeye (who had become almost unlikable / a complete psychopath0 as opposed to Black Widow (who is a fan favorite). There were also a lot of inconsistencies with regards to bringing people back from the dead - they were brought back 5 years later, but they had not aged (while everyone else around them did age). Yet somehow, Peter Parker is still going to high school with all of the same high school friends who have miraculously NOT aged (unless they had all been deleted by Thanos, I find this highly unlikely). Captain Marvel, while very cool, was made to be too powerful. They also waited far too long to bring everyone back - not until the very end of the movie. So while it was 'enjoyable' (end fight scene was fantastic), there were many things that could have been done better."
1833,I was slightly underwhelmed by the movie and I didn't cry at the ending at all. There was far too much sickly sweet scenes for my liking.The time travel bit left more questions than answers for me. The 2nd click mmmmI won't be going to see anymore Marvel movies apart from maybe Black Panther as I'm done
1834,"Honestly, no MCU movie has got me so emotionally involved in it's story and Endgame does just that. Not only do I get my CGI epic fight scene fix, I also felt closure with the first 6 avengers this is truly a masterpiece and a Must Watch for any movie buff, casual and child."
1835,"Like every time travel movie ever made Avengers Endgame established ""rules"" of time travel and then broke them repeatedly. Time travel movies never have sound logic and this isn't an exception. Like I said, it had some fun moments but overall it was meh.P.S. Fat Thor did nothing for the story line, it made his earth-shattering experience seem funny. Making him fat was good for one laugh and then it just got old, in my opinion."
1836,"It's going to be very difficult to top this, and it's also very difficult to express how amazing this film is without spoilers, so I will just keep it brief and say that you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't see this film. It is an epic event in every sense of the word, and you will never forget seeing this movie. The last hout will never leave your memory as long as you live. It is the epitome of action sacrifice and heroism and encapsulates the never ending battle of good versus evil. Go see this movie. See it twice."
1837,"This movie was weak, it's as simple as that:cons:thor's mental breakdown is a dumb decision, he didn't even get close to such state after his parent's death and now supposedly blames himself for not saving half of the humanity? such nonsense, and even if he was blaming i'm not sure playing console and drinking bear is like the quintessence of self blamecaptain marvel is for me completely unlikable character, with her always ""resting bitchy face"" mode on, laughable ""I want to talk to manager"" hairstyle and her crazy quazi feminism but more sexist attitude. What's more her power levels are so absurd that whenever she appears you can close your eyes, count to ten, cause no one stands a chance, so what's the point in watching it if the result is so obviouscap learning to use Thor's hammer in the middle of a battle, all of a sudden, and using it to it's full extent, at moments using it even better than Thor is pure absurd. Cap's just an enchanced human and him reaching power on par with Thor in matter of minutes is total nonsense.hulk is totally useless. Bannerohulk claims that he connected the best of both, but you can't really see him that usefull in battle, such a waste of character which was really enjoyable to watchthe scene where avengers mansion is bombarded and everyone walks out without a scratch is beyond absurd even for marvel standardsthe scene where in middle of probably most important battle for the whole universe, 8 or so female characters form a perfect majestic line is simply pathetic and cheap. It also strips away any feel of danger or gravity of this battle. It also stinks of really stupid propaganda / indoctrinationthanos's black order is killed so easilly whereas in the previous movie they fought as equall with the most powerfull characters of mcu, so now it's another example of lousy writingin the ending scenes, Thanos's inability to click his fingers although he had the gauntlet for quite a long time on, is unexplainable. It's hard to belive that he was perfectly stopped couple of times when it would take him less than a secondThanon's friendlyfire bombardment lacks any credibility as he didn't even manage to kill a single important oponent. If marvel gets rid of certain charaters than they could at least let some die, it would so much believable, watch and learn from GOT how battles should be done.the fact that Stark is able to use the gaunlet although he is a mere human with totally no powers is crazy. Quill and the rest of the guardians had to do it together to only survive the power surge one single infinity stone, where start used all and even lived to say his goodbyes. id-io-tic!I would also like to point that all of the characters that stories are ended are white, and all but one are male. Maybe it's a coincidence but I kinda doubt that.Most of the time the movie is really slow paced, although I can understand that that was in a way, a farewell for some characters so it's needed more dialogue than action.Majority of the jokes, as always, were pretty forced, akward or placed in a really strange spot like in the midst of extremly dangerous battle. It strips the feeling of any danger to the charactersThe movie was really predictible. Infinity war did a way better job is suprising the viewer.
Most likely I forgot to mention somePros:It was spectacular visually at some points.I am aware that it's an extremly hard task to close a longer than a decade of films, plot lines and stories. So I try to not be too harsh. But at the same time I feel that many choices were wrong, stupid or unsatisfying.
Overally this movie is way worse than the previous installment of Avengers, also it's probably my last marvel movie as I really don't see enough likeable and genuine characters left to form new fundaments for this universe, also I don't like how those movie become more and more about some propaganda or indotrination rather than pure well written fun, as it used to be."
1838,"Just came out of the cinema and the first word coming to my mind is 'EPIC'. This movie concluded the past 11 years in the best possible way or even better because a movie like this seemed to be impossible. The great battle scene is the very best in cinematic history, to be honest it is almost as good as an orgasm. I am happy that I could witness it - what is more on the premiere day. This masterpiece made me prouder than ever to be an MCU fan! Well done! Pretty sure I will pay to see it again... and again... :)"
1839,"Just watch it by yourself. This movie has more deep story, and will mix all your feelings as well. Thanks god nowadays kid has a great role model for them and thanks god that i was born into this era when this Comic Book Movie exist."
1840,No nooo nooo just nooo :) just nooooo :) this is the movie i was waiting for 4 month???? Noooo just noooooo worst movie ever !!! Nooo nooo just nooooooooooo
1841,"SO GOOOOOOD it has every emotion in one sadness, happiness, joy, it has everything there were a few scenes that were a bit cringe but other than that a near perfect"
1842,"What surprised me most about the movie is how funny it was. There were any number of hilarious moments that countered the profoundly sad moments. Rocket scammering away from chasing Asgardian soldiers, Stark and Nebula playing paper football, Thor playing video games and threatening a child player and on and on. Hilarious.I was concerned about how they would handle Captain Marvel because she is very powerful. I was really happy with her scenes as well as the one in which the Scarlett Witch showed up in super pissed off mode. I also stood up and cheered when Captain America wielded Mjolnir. The scene where EVERYBODY showed up via mystic portals was uber nerd paradise.I was a bit underwhelmed with how they handled Thor early on in the movie. While it was very funny, it was disappointing to see that he had let himself fall apart in an alcoholic stupor. I feel that his obligation to Odin to take care of people would have forced him to devote himself to that responsibility.Now for the deaths...first off, when I saw Black Widow and Hawkeye heading off to get the soulstone, I figured that was the end of Hawkeye. I never saw Black Widow dying as an even remote possibility but it does make a bit of sense. I was still sad to see her go.In retrospect, Tony Stark's sacrifice was foreshadowed heavilly in the scene where he cracked the time travel problem. He told Pepper that he could just throw it all away and live his life. He had to be true to his character's own purpose and be the hero. When he was dying, you could hear several people crying....loudly.We are going to see it again tomorrow. Well done Marvel. You really went for the head with great success."
1843,"A must see,
Best movie ever!!!!
I really think this is the best super hero movie ever made!!!
Thank you Marvel"
1844,"The movie is entertaining and time will fly faster than expected as you're in it. On any standard I do recommend the movie if not for anything else, but for it's entertainment value. I do believe the hype that is going on around the movie will be letting some people down.I'm in between giving it a 6 or 7 because of the well executed entertainment value it provides. I will have to round it down to 6 because of the amount of 10's this movie is getting at the moment. The movie neither blows your brains with plot twists or anything like that.Comparing this purely to other superhero movies I'd give this one a 9-. I think Infinity Wars was better, but this concludes the Avenger series perfectly."
1845,"A bit disappointed. There is something missing.
It's a good tribute to the mceu, but not a very good story."
1846,"Unpopular opinion. there are too many plot holes, not an epic movie opposed to what fanboys think. Entertaining but slow paced.I watched IW thrice but wouldn't like to see endgame again."
1847,"Excellent, the Best of the Best !
Great 10 years of MCU 🍷"
1848,"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor."
1849,"Before reading this, I just request you to take two minutes and think of best possible conclusion to this 22 movies saga. Thought of one? Now multiply the awesomeness of your ending by a 100 times and still this movie will surprise your assumptions! If a critic like me who just can't stop finding errors in a movie failed in finding big mistakes in this movie, I think you should believe this one is just perfect! Sure there were a few tweaks, but I am ready to ignore them seeing how smoothly the whole 3 hours of the runtime just passed by. I was literally sticked to my seat for 3 hours, even during the interval, I was like I want to see the whole movie in one length. Tell you the truth, I was not much impressed with Infinity wars or Ragnarok (not even mentioning captain marvel here xD), but Russo brothers just nailed this one. After waiting for 21 movies, we deserved a perfect end, and we got one. 10/10 from my side. If 21 movies lead to this, I am ready to watch another set of 21 for such a perfection!"
1850,"Story was lame and sooo predictable...It gave its own spoiler about whats gonna happen in the next 3 hours...The fight senes were very limited and mediocre.Expected to be great but ..not good..I know why people are Soo hyping this movie but I don't feel it ..The movie summed up ...1/2 of movie about getting dead back
1/2 of movie about tribute for the previous films"
1851,"I have never wrote a review about any movie I watch. I just feel that I have to document what just touched my heart. Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, without cinema was hard for me. I remember I used to wait months after the movie comes out to watch it online. When I was in college, I used to travel to Bahrain to watch Marvel movies. I enjoyed watching all the movies. I have developed a strong connection with all the characters. I feel what they feel, I understand what they understand. It became a part of my life. My friends, even my close friends, used to make fun of me for watching superheroes movies. They always say that there is no story it is all CGI, what are you watching it for? They do not understand the creativity of developing characters and flashbacks, let alone understanding a complex plot with many planets and universes. I am so happy that I made it to the U.S and watched the movie in the opening day. With that said, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic movies I have ever seen. I laughed too loud, cried too hard, and smiled a lot. I will not write any spoilers, I am not that guy, but I wanted to share some of the feelings that I experienced in these epic three hours. The movie has everything perfect the writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. If there is one wish that I could have in life is that watching this movie with someone I love who have the same admiration for Marvel movies. To the creators, actors and actresses, people behind the scene, and everyone participated in creating it I cannot thank you enough for what you have done. I know this is not a perfect review but I had to share it somehow."
1852,"I have loved the MCU for years but I am more than diappointed with this movie. #Superficially is felt similar to the others even though the plainly obvious addition of emotional scenes to wrap up a few of those characters was at times just too on the nose and I personally am not a fan of how it ended in general, there are just so many inconsistencies and plain errors in the timeline of the movie, that I guess are either going to be ignored or tried to be patched up after the fact.Fantasy only works for suspending reality if they stick to the rules they define for their own universe and Endgame dropped the ball multiple times on this. It's disappointing, that this is how it ends."
1853,"First of all, from a critics perspective, the movie had everything to be a complete success. The visuals were amazing, the soundtrack was a perfect underline to every scene and the plot contained several unexpected twists. However, the movie just didn't do it for me personally.Before I start complaining, I went in that movie with high expactations, due to it being the grand finale to an 11 years ongoing era, but was open for everything to happen.Except for just enough things that made me feel like it wasn't the finale I wished to see.Starting with the attack on Thanos in the first part of the movie. It was too fast and too easy to be the follow up of Infinity War. Thanos killed our beloved characters but the revenge for it just wasn't satisfiying and felt like they want to get rid of him as fast as possible just to bring his former conquerer self on screen to have a villain to fight.
It was surprising, but it wasn't a good surprise.Second, the humour felt kinda off. Don't get me wrong, the jokes were great and I laughed at some of them, but often they were misplaced. For such a serious situation, there were to many jokes.
Fat Thor was hilarious, but I would have liked this in the probably upcoming Asguardians of the galaxy movie, where they just chill in space and get fat, but not in the finale of an era.The solution for defeating Thanos, undo the snap and what they had to do for it were just to easy. I never had the feeling, that they were risking something. For every problem, there was a fast solution. There wasn't a moment where the stakes were high. It felt like ""yeah just do it"".Additionally, I think the Russo brothers went full safe mode with the happenings. Everything the fans wanted to see was in it. Wich sounds great, but there wasn't any real surprise. It felt like I knew exactly what will happen next and how the movie ends (just a note here: I tried to avoid any trailers or theories, so I went in that movie only with my own thoughts about it). It was indeed a good storyline, but way to predictable.Also, the movie was slow paced, but the important scenes, for example the comeback of all characters at the final battle, did not have enough time to breathe. There was so much happening at that battle, that every reunion was so fast and rushed. More time for it would have made it more emotional.These are just a few things that bothered me. Nevertheless there are a lot of good things as well.The movie took its time to have as much of a goodbye to the characters as possible.
The chemistry between the characters was on point.
The timetravels to the old movies were a great recap of what happened.
Tony's death and the funeral were emotional as hell.Overall, the movie just isn't the worthy finale for an unbelievebly well made cinematic universe. It did everything to be a good ending but lacked the surprises as a consequence. It is a must watch for fans, but as a movie itself it is by far not as good as Infinity War."
1854,Great movie i almost cried and great ending to the series of movies
1855,"Avengers Endgame is a movie that never bored me despite being 3 hours long and the action in this movie was incredible probably the best in the MCU and it's one of my favorite movie of all time because of how much I love the characters I love the acting, the action and most of the humor and I just love this movie but why did they add fat Thor because just like Hulk in Infinity War it's just not that funny and they could have done it for dramatic reasons but they didn't making it a joke that falls flat."
1856,"I did enjoy the first half of the show. It was subtle and emotional. This was the first time ever in the franchise that they show us the capability of the actors they hired (except for Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland of course as they have been pretty much one-note. Well, it might be because of the script. They can still prove their ability in many other movies in the future).Then the action part came in. The central theme of the Avengers franchise. The time traveling was intriguing and everything, but seriously the end was a mess. That scene with force-feminism was ""cringy"" to its best. The death of the character(s) also felt forced and unnecessary."
1857,"This was my fifth time to watch this movie , I still remember how I was hyped before it released , as we know Avengers endgame is the end of an era to most of the beloved characters , but is it the end of an era deserved ? . Without a shadow of doubt , my answer is YES !!! . This how you end a franchise and start a new one . For me this movie had a numerous positive aspects . First and for most , the acting . This movie has a great number of well-known , talented actors .
For example , Chris Hemsworth one of the best thing in this movie , his performance was stunning by which he made me show sympathy to his character and on the same time he can turn it into a comedy situation, if this not a great performance I don't know what it is , and of course RDJ one of the greatest actors to a comic book character , irreplaceable and astonishing . Some people say they ruined characters like Thor and professor hulk or it was pointless to turn them like this .....oh wait what if Bruce banner snapped his finger without being hulk or what if hulk snapped his finger without Bruce mind ? In both ways it won't work one will die and the other is stupid enough to ruin it ,but what if we combined the power with the mind , think about it again please . Some people say they could've saved tony or whatever okay let's talk about what if they did , if you were concentrating it will create another timeline they would lose in it so Ironman was really satisfying. Everyone did great job there actually . Secondly , the soundtrack that never failed to add suspense to most of the scenes . And The CGI was perfectly done . Thank you Russo bros for giving us one of the best movies in the last decade , for me it was the best ."
1858,"Wow. This film will have you going through every emotion imaginable.
If you have followed every Marvel movie in sequence leading up to this conclusion, you will soon be left feeling like you have lost a family member. An amazing end to this Marvel chapter."
1859,"Awsome. Im stunned.
How in gods name can someone give this movie a rating of 1?"
1860,"Original review -- 25/04/2019: deleted.New review -- 08/07/2019: Finally, the inner fanboyism in me has been tarnished. I ain't biased towards Marvel, the MCU for that matter, just because I love it as much as I do, so I put thought into any and all MCU reviews and give them unbiased, strong reviews and have reasons for my opinions. Not all MCU movies are great- to be honest there are some I don't even like that much, others I liked at first but have found myself loathing more as time goes on, the older I get. Take Captain Marvel, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, and Thor 2 for example; those are some I don't care for all that much. Endgame is in every sense of the word, fantastic. It's very well-executed and has so much emotion and captures the essence of each character, pushes boundaries and excels in cinematography, choreography, acting, directing (for the most part), chemistry, dialogue, action, narrative, and even development of character itself, with several story arcs concluding, rightfully so. To balance it out it has charm and comedy, which for the most part is funny and isn't overdone. But there are one or two jokes that feel forced or they're just unfunny. I couldn't care less about that awful newly-added ""end-credit scene"" - come on, it's unfinished, forced and terrible, and who are we kidding it's a deleted scene if anything. You're definitely up for it if you sit for the entire three hours but ultimately, I feel, it's worth it and the film showcases what Marvel- the MCU, rather, is, has done and has become as a landmark in superhero movies and film itself. That FORCED all-women, all-out ""heroism"" scene is absolute, utter cringe-central, and not because I ""hate women,"" or am some neckbeard ""anti-feminist,"" no. It's just unnecessary, unessential and completely redundant in every sense of the word, to say the least. Also, Thanos, character-wise, at least, isn't nearly as good as he is in Infinity War, although one could argue he's actually at his peak performance wise here as he's more vicious, younger, thus, arguably faster and more extreme in combat, all the while keeping his wisdom and personality. No gauntlet? No worries, he's still menacing and extremely powerful. Have to praise the performances in particular, that of Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Paul Rudd, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and I still have to praise the voice-work, motion capture and portrayal of the character by Josh Brolin - I still thought he was excellent as Thanos and Thanos, while not as epic and captivating as he was in its predecessor, is still genuinely awesome. I still absolutely love the film, maybe not just AS much, but it's still a 10/10 from me, even after having seen it numerous, countless times by now. And they probably couldn't have killed off Iron Man in a more heroic, selfless, heartfelt way. Ridiculously good performances are seen at the end, and that battle at the end is still one of the most incredible things I've seen to date...ACT I -- INFINITY WAR > ENDGAMEACT II -- they're pretty much tied but I would have to give the upper hand to ENDGAMEACT III -- again, this is tough and they're almost tied, but I'll give ENDGAME the edge mainly thanks to, ""Good, just as long as we're all in agreement..."" in which battle ensues, Thor, Captain America and Iron Man vs Thanos, as well as the Avengers, Ravagers, armies of Wakanda and Asgard vs Thanos, the Black Order, Chitauri, etc, and because, well, Rogers wields Mjolnir and it's simply epic (and come on, that's pretty much everybody's favourite scene, is it not).Despite some minor issues, the film's still very emotionally-driven, heartfelt, shocking, sad, fun, thrilling, menacing, intriguing and uplifting all in one, with some of the best and most epic action sequences of any film I've seen..."
1861,"The movie is an epic conclusion of the Infinity Saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and with it's 3 hours it feels so short.
The easter eggs and references from the other movies gives an excelent bonus to the movie, although is not perfect for some minor details, it's an outstanding conclusion and makes us want more of the MCU."
1862,"What more is there to say? They've had some good Marvel movies, but this is a tier above the others."
1863,Avengers endgame movie is the best movie ever for the world
1864,"Usually i don't have an habit to review each movie as it comes out but finds myself writing this review as i was so hyped for this movie.The directors was so focused about the proper send off ROBERT DOWNY JR that they literally ignored the mistakes that they committed in the movie.Real Question is that in order to win it was really required iron man to sacrifice himself ?
he was in possession of all infinity stones,instead of snapping he can really use the REALITY STONE to make a joke out of thanos and his army.
also the directors Treatment for character like HULK and Thor was so disappointed specially HULK ""WE LITERALLY DESERVE THANOS VS HULK REMATCH"".
Also at various moments there is a small pause is required so that the importance of that moment can be shown but it was missing eg CAPTAIN holding Hammer should be given some time so that it would felt like something big has happened.
and lets not even talk about the messy time travel and that captain growing old part.
All in all really disappointed with the movie and literally not worth all the hype it is getting."
1865,A thing I don't get is 2 things why at the last scene of the movie why did captain America chose to go back into the past and stay there with his well wife but pegge is dead why would you fool with it why answer is simple marvel is a fool movie company now A DAYS and last thing why did black widow chose to die instead of hawkie black widow doenst deserve to die guess who does hawkie does because hawkie hasn't been in marvel movies forever and black widow has its a rip no one honestly should see it its a rip moreLY to me that infinity war is on Netflix it shouldn't
1866,"Well, it finally happened: I got emotional during a Marvel movie. Sorry, not sorry. This film truly was a fitting conclusion to a decade of MCU films. While it was a classic action sequel, it was also filled with surprises, homages, laughs, and emotional moments. Unfortunately, that's a LOT to accomplish in one movie (hence the 3 hour runtime). Fortunately, almost all of it worked. They wanted to bring 22 movies to an epic climax...mission accomplished. I'm not sure that I would put this one alongside the best stand alone MCU chapters (Winter Soldier, Black Panther, Ragnarok, Iron Man, etc.), but it somehow pulled all those movies together in a pretty magical way. I complain a lot about the comic book-ification of film, but I can also recognize the accomplishment that is the MCU."
1867,Save your money and time. This movie could've been done in a hour and half. Big disappointment compared to the other avengers movies.
1868,"This I had to see...But oh well, must be all those die-hard Marvel fanboys at it again.Lot's of CGI, green screen and jokes in this SOAP OPERA with way too many characters. And yes, here comes the CGI villain again.It wasn't for me.Captain America: Winter Soldier is still the best Marvel movie."
1869,"There are a handful of Marvel films better than this one, but they are few and far between.The movie could probably have aired an hour shorter and been better. I almost dozed off a few times. Almost.Things I liked:
Intro scene and the ""real life"" aftermath of Thanos
Thanos destroying the stones and living peacefully
Killing off main characters (iron man and widow)
The battle (with the exception of the all woman scene)
Thanos realizing he had to kill all life and start new
Captain America not coming back.
Fat Thor throughout the entire movie.The rest was pretty boring and the Hulk was annoying.Ragnarok, Infinity War, Dr Strange, and Iron Man were all better movies.Sue me."
1870,"3 hours of too much wasted plot.
Instead of introducing deeper on new characters."
1871,"They made it that way on purpose, so that most people would have to say ""yes, we think we understand, yea..."" so not to look like a bunch of idiots. There's power in the denial!
But go watch it for the laughs, I'm not a type of person to cringe over a cheesy joke, but whoever was responsible for comedy relief this time around has gotten to me! Was it RDJ? He a genuinely funny guy.I rate this sci-fi fantasy:
6/10
-1 for over the top CGI,
-2 for deus ex machina,
-1 for trying to make me feel for too many characters! Because I can't do lazy writing.
and -1 for shameless AUDI plug but I won't go below 6."
1872,Good but a bit overrated movie by marvel fans. I was excited before watching the movie but after watching the movie not meeting my expections.
1873,I dont like how they killed iron man and black widow. Iron man kills himself and black widow also kills herself. what dosent make sense is they could have gone back in time to save them in the end but they dont. when iron man dies captain america ditches the avengers and goes back to the past to live with his old girlfriend leaving the avengers to fight thanos. basically this movie was disappointing for me and the ending is just bad.
1874,This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.
1875,"It was disappointing
total out of brains and not as perfect as before
these two brothers messed up this time
the acting was terrible
and i will never watch any movie from marvel studios any more
waste of money and time"
1876,"This is probably one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the moment, with Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker (2019). The previous opus of the Avengers series, Avengers: Infinity War (2018), had left 'us' high and dry, in the depths of the abyss, while the latest episode of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Captain Marvel (2019), gave 'us' back a glimmer of hope.In short, I saw it in Paris this morning and I enjoyed it. It's an efficient blockbuster. The script and the manifold plot twists permanently keep the audience spellbound and breathless. This movie is one of the funniest and one of the most spectacular of the complete Marvel Cinematic Universe saga, not to mention an astonishing Computer-Generated Imagery, despite manifold script weaknesses that I will partially reveal below, within a dedicated post-script.Otherwise, a very unusual observation, at least within Paris: the audience has repeatedly applauded, at least 7/8 times, including the very beginning and the end of the movie, conveying an uncontrollable impatience, like a collective catharsis boosted to the extreme. And a female teen, about 17/18 years old, not far from me, cried. Literally! The audience was obviously made up of fans conquered beforehand... and that was part of the show!So Marvel, what's next? I am probably addicted and certainly impatient!As a post-script, a few remarks, annoyances or even irritations:1) First, a tiny spoiler as a favor. You will get absolutely nothing at the very end. Contrary to the Marvel habits and customs, there is no post-credit scene.2) The first half-hour is an immeasurable disappointment. While Thanos had, in the first opus, undertaken a Herculean task, a titanic challenge, a Homeric Odyssey in order to gather the 6 infinity stones and ""bring balance to the universe"" as a demiurge, in the second opus, he contents himself with a miserable and lonely life such as a peasant from the Middle Ages, because ""the stones served no purpose beyond temptation"". Wooooow! Literally incredible.3) Who understood this quote from Tony Stark to Steve Rogers? ""It's the EPR paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might have wound up pushing time through Lang"". Honestly, I do not know if we need an IQ above 250 or below 60 to understand this quote...4) During the manifold fights versus the Avengers, we do not really see the difference between Thanos with the 6 infinity stones and Thanos without: his power seems unchanged!5) Time travel exists fundamentally in two versions: a change in the past will or will not have an impact in the future. Even if the first category is the most representative with classics such as The Terminator (1984) or Back to the Future (1985), Avengers: Endgame (2019) clearly belongs to the second category.6) For their time heist, the Avengers break down into 3 separate teams to join 3 distinct time-spaces in which there are 3 Thanos. One Thanos in each space-time: New-York in 2012, Asgard in 2013, Morag+Vormir in 2014. During 60 minutes, we follow these 3 concomitant stories. The Thanos from 2014 discovers and understands the whole intrigue thanks to his daughter Nebula. Nevertheless, the Avengers are able to switch from one space-time to another one, thanks to a protective suit, a GPS bracelet and a capsule containing Pym particles. Thus, these three elements are specially designed by Tony Stark, with the posthumous help of Hank Pym, for such an expedition and are a priori mandatory for the way in and the way back. But we do not really know how, the Thanos from 2014 will go back in time with his faithful right-hand man Ebony Maw, the whole armada and a huge spaceship. Wooooow! Even alone, this time-travel should be impossible.7) For the time heist in Vormir, why Natacha Romanoff and Clint Barton have to go first through Morag, with James Rhodes and Nebula? The Avengers could have splitted the whole team in 4 instead of 3 from the start, right? So, why 3 teams instead of 4? Knowing that I see no reason for this detour via Morag, I think that the scriptwriters were desperately stuck and were looking for a way for the Thanos of 2014 to recover a free fast-pass, i.e. a protective suit + a GPS bracelet + a Pym capsule. Those of the mortal remains of Natacha Romanoff. Except that the Thanos of 2014 was absolutely not aware of the presence of this corpse on Vormir. In any way!8) The scriptwriters have combined two ultra-complex concepts, i.e. time travel and quantum realm, in order to optimally cheat the audience. Indeed, when Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are back in New-York, they are magically able to time-travel from New-York in 2012 to Camp Lehigh in 1970 without the help of any quantum tunnel device...9) .... and so on ... and so on ... The screenwriters had obviously bigger eyes than belly! In short, this is a typical pop corn movie: turn your brain off, and then, and then only, enjoy the show!10) At last, a two-penny question: where did they find inspiration for the hairstyles? A moronic soccer player for Clint Barton, undoubtedly. Without forgetting Carol Danvers, or how to disfigure a sex bomb with a pair of scissors?That's all, folks!"
1877,"An interesting film and quite successful conclusion to the story with all the main and third-party hero lines involved to this point. But there are two minuses: soooooo boring and unnecessary stretching of dialogues and meaningful looks at each other which stretch the film even more... and a completely artificial looking drama where they tried to show it, especially with inappropriate jokes that are considered normal for Marvel's films in another situation, but at this drama they spoil it additionally.
However, this does not spoil the overall impression of the film, which I was pleased with."
1878,What a huge disappointment. Hulk is a wimp. Thor is a fat drunk. No fight scenes. I am a huge Marvels fan I could not have been more disappointed with this movie. Anyone saying this was great needs to be evaluated.
1879,"For the most part, it succeeds, offering fans -- especially hard-core fans who've obsessed over the MCU films -- a satisfying conclusion. That it can serve so many different functions and work as an entertaining blockbuster in its own right is a testament to the vision of Marvel Studios and the skill of Endgame directors Anthony and Joe Russo.
But it's not perfect. And after a bit of reflection, you might scratch your head at the implications of some of Endgame's twists.Seriously, back away now.
Here are the biggest questions I have after Endgame:What's the deal with Hawkeye's new getup?
Let's start with an easy one before we really go down the rabbit hole.
Comics fans will recognize Clint Barton's switch from Hawkeye to Ronin, but the movie didn't fully explain the need for the new identity and costume. I get that losing your family is traumatic, but does it justify a hero costume makeover -- not to mention a full-sleeve tattoo? And where the heck did he get those new weapons and gear? He doesn't have the support of SHIELD anymore, so is he independently wealthy like Bruce Wayne?
It seems Hawkeye is a victim of the limited character development he's had in the past. Endgame makes it up to him, but there's a little too much at once.
At least he looks cool though.
What about those five years?
Early in Endgame the story jumps ahead five years, showing the survivors living with the fallout of what's been called ""The Decimation."" When the Avengers save the day, everyone returns to the present, five years after the crisis. It's a bold decision that ensures the MCU remains scarred by Thanos' infamous snap.
But the five-year gap leads to a lot of questions. What about the people who died in those five years? And as CNET editor Mike Sorrentino pointed out, what if someone moved on in life and remarried in that period? That would make for an awkward reunion.On top of that, can humanity even rebuild from becoming a postapocalyptic society? It's hard to see everyone going back to the way things were, though that seemed to be the implication when we saw Peter Parker returning to school.
Speaking of which...
How will Phase 4 address the time jump?
The trailers for Spider-Man: Far From Home -- the final movie in the MCU's Phase 3 -- hint at Peter Parker and friends on a fun international romp through Europe. Should we assume they were all affected by The Snap but are now continuing their education five years later like nothing happened? Has international tourism just picked up where it left off? How will Far From Home address the time jump?
The ramifications are even more serious with Black Panther, whose sequel will likely be part of Phase 4. Wakanda lost its king, and his sister, for five years. What happened? Did someone else take over? And does T'Challa automatically regain the throne after his return?
One of the final scenes had T'Challa overlooking his kingdom alongside Queen Ramanda and Shuri. But that glosses over some serious constitutional questions about how things operated while he was gone.
What about the history of the MCU?
Any time you employ time travel in a story, you're going to open cracks in logic. The Russo brothers admirably tried to button up the leaks by having Captain America return the stones to their various places in the timeline -- but that doesn't fix everything.For instance...
Are there two Captain Americas now?
We have the original Steve Rogers frozen in ice until he woke up in the 21st century MCU, as we saw in the movies. But now there's a second, older Steve Rogers hanging out in Peggy Carter's home in the intervening years. One theory is that Captain America was always going to go back in time and secretly reunite and marry Peggy.
There was a reference to Peggy getting married and having kids, but in a scene between Rogers and Carter in Captain America: Winter Soldier, there aren't any photos of her husband.
Still, it's a stretch to imagine Captain America staying hidden all that time -- especially knowing that Hydra had infiltrated Shield years earlier.Where the heck is Loki?
During the Back to the Future-style trip back to the events of the original Avengers movie, Scott Lang and Tony Stark's attempt to nab the Space Stone backfires, allowing the freshly apprehended Loki to nab the gem and disappear.
Ultimately, did Loki's escape change his fate at the hands of Thanos in Infinity War? It's plausible, given reports that Disney Plus is working on an original show based on the character.
But if that's true, then wouldn't it have affected the events of Thor: The Dark World, also revisited in Endgame? But during Thor's own time-jaunt we briefly see Loki in a cell, so the timeline wasn't altered.
How are Nebula and Gamora alive?
When Present Good Nebula shoots Past Evil Nebula, shouldn't Present Good Nebula cease to exist, like the photograph in Back to the Future? Alternatively, if it did happen to Past Evil Nebula, then Present Good Nebula should remember it, and in turn that memory would've been downloaded so Past Evil Nebula would see the hit coming
And don't get us started on how there's now an alternate version of Gamora.
Did Infinity War even happen?
Thanos and his crew jumped ahead from 2013 (during the original Guardians of the Galaxy) to the present, and are defeated. So past-Thanos couldn't have manipulated the events that led to Infinity War. If he never gathered the stones, Tony couldn't have undone the snap, which didn't even happen anyway.
And now my head hurts...
How did 2014 Thanos send his ship to the present?
There's a scene where Nebula hands over a vial of the Pym particles to Thanos, but the Avengers all seemed to need those snazzy white suits to travel through the Quantum Realm. Why is Thanos' ship different?
Also, if Nebula handed her one and only vial to Thanos, how did she get back? Or if she used that final vial, how did Thanos go forward in time?
Can the gauntlet revive Thanos?
Don't forget, the gauntlet is still around.
Did Captain America reconnect with the Red Skull?
Remember, Cap went back in time to return all of the Infinity Stones, right? If he returned the soul stone to Vormir, wouldn't he have run into the Red Skull? Granted, Red Skull was likely freed from his burden of watching over the stone, but it's not like he has a ship to take him off planet.
That would be a heck of an awkward reunion.
Would Tony Stark back his brain up?
He's done it in the comics. Or maybe I'm still in denial about losing Robert Downey Jr. Let's hope the Avengers don't pluck a teenage Tony from earlier in the timeline either... that's happened too.
Is Black Widow really dead?
This is one death that seems permanent, as it completes Natasha Romanov's arc as a loner spy who found a family worth sacrificing herself for. As she said in Avengers, ""I've got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe it out."" Consider it wiped.
But there's the persistent buzz that Black Widow will star in her own film. Sure, it could be a prequel, but this is a comic book universe, and deaths are all too easily reversed. In fact, of all the people left supposedly dead at the end of Endgame, three -- Black Widow, Loki and the Vision -- are all headlining future MCU movies and TV shows.
Where's Vision?
With WandaVision coming to the Disney Plus streaming service, there was a chance that Vision would return. But aside from a passing reference at the end by Wanda, Vision was nowhere to be found. The show could be a prequel to Infinity War, but in that movie Shuri was working on separating Vision from his Infinity Stone -- could he be resurrected without it?
Is Hulk's consciousness gone?
Bruce Banner and the Hulk have merged into ""Professor Hulk."" It seems Bruce is more in control, presumably submerging the Hulk personality we last saw in Thor: Ragnarok. How did that even happen? It's a pretty big deal to just explain away as happening offscreen.
Does Thor ever eat a salad?
Big Belly Thor is the best Thor."
1880,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. A terrible way to wrap up 22 movies. Absolute garbage.
1881,"Everyone shines in this movie. Directed to the fans of these 10 last years of Marvel movies. A thank you, beautiful, tragic, fun. The emotion stills my words just after seeing the movie. Have to see it twice again to do it justice."
1882,"It is awe-inspiring, soul-crushing and ever-surprising. I seriously don't think they could've crafted a finer conclusion."
1883,"So much potential. I think I expected a bit too much- all the build up in the previous movies and we have here disappointing, dialogue filled, over emotional and hardly any action at all. The drama is quite unnecessary- I get it, but it isn't really what we want.
Anyone giving 9's and 10's- fair enough- clearly true movie fans, because the movie isn't poor.
The rest of us have good reason to be disappointed.
Thor is a joke- I did find it funny to begin with but they carried it on throughout the film. Captain Marvel- the movie was alright and promised a lot in this movie as far as I and a lot of others were concerned- we got nothing. A little bit at the end where you think she'll get it all sorted but nope.So much potential, yet so frustrating. Did I like it? Of course. Is it a 9 or 10? Nope."
1884,"Avengers:Endgame is a superhero film we all yearned for after the Infinity war spectacle and The Dark Knights standard but this film surely was far beyond expectations and was gripping entertaining humorous and emotional.
Yes the movie kicks off to a slow start about the Avengers still learning and moving on from their loss but they found a way to reverse the ruins. Thanos the mad titan and the villain again proved to be one of the best villains abd surely some competition for the Avengers.
It is a movie which will stun you
This movie is a Perfect 10/10"
1885,They landed the plane. You cannot do a better job of ending a gigantic story. Kudos to the Russo brothers and the entire cast.
1886,Greatest movie ever. Hats off to the creators and the cast. Would recommend everyone one out there to watch it. Has everything nostalgic to sentimental vibes a perfect example of what a new era movie should be. I bet even the toughest men alive will cry watching it. Respect to those who sacrificed themselves in the making of a great legacy.
1887,"11 years later , 21 films later .
A pure masterpiece was born . 3hrs of heartmelting hardhitting , chest thumping film. Thank you stan , thank you Russo and thank you marvel for this beautiful film to look back on after I have kids and I show this to them and say , I lived a beautiful life."
1888,"Because the ending was amazing. I'm not lying when i say that there were 3 grown men crying in front of me during the ending, and i heard some sniffing a couple of rows further.It was truly an amazing ending to all of this and they have my respect. They've lost almost of it because of the Captain Marvel fiasco, but they restored it because of this film. Captain Marvel has a cute new haircut which totally fits her personality. I was wondering when she would tell Thanos to get his manager so that Thanos can get fired and everyone's saved. Didn't happen, but i wouldn't be surprised if it did.There is only one man who made and ended this franchise, and i was sincerely happy with his role in all of this. Tony Stark. What an absolute boss."
1889,So as we know this is the last part of avengers series and for me after this no entertainment is left
1890,"By no stretch of the imagination does this movie deserve a spot next to Dark Knight, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Shawshank Redemption or any where within the top 100 movies. It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though)."
1891,"An absolute perfect ending. The MCU began with the birth of the legendary Iron Man, and this part of it ended with the hero's death. The moment that he said ""I am Iron Man"" and snapped his fingers sold the movie for me. Even though Tony Stark had a tear-jerking death, it was an epic and heroic ending for his character, wrapping up his part of the MCU.I also adored that Steve finally gave Peggy the dance she was promised. And when he was finally worthy for Mjolnir, it tied in to Avengers: Age of Ultron extremely well.All in all, this movie was, in my opinion, a masterpiece, and I will be watching it many times again."
1892,The worst avengers with weird plotchanges that took no risks. With a predictable story and predictable ending. Boring at times.
1893,"#New York city..
This movie is very good, there is no mistake in it. but some moment is missing in this movie I wanted to see a single fight between iron Man and thanos. Also with the main character of MCU. but overall it's a good movie and I love 3000 and special thanks for Russo brother and Stan Lee.."
1894,"I am a huge fan of these movies. However, I just purchased the Blu-ray and have watched this film for now the third time. Approximately at the two hour mark, the ""Smart Hulk"" snaps his fingers to undo everything. Then amazingly Clint's-cell phone rings with call from his wife Laura's mobile AFTER 5 YEARS OF BEING DEAD. So you mean to tell me not only did he keep paying the cell plan, but also, that while he was on the road around the world killing people, he kept her phone charged at home and kept paying the power bill at his house as well? Come on.... OR When Laura went to the dimension where all the other people went to that were eliminated, she had or found a cell phone charger and and outlet? At 2:22 we see Ant-Man and the Wasp in the van trying to ""Hotwire"" the vehicle, then seconds later after Clint passes the gauntlet to Black Panther, at the 2:23 mark we see a giant Ant-Man in the background (while he's still supposed to be with Wasp in the van). AND THEY NEVER CAME BACK TO,,,, HUGE HUGE HOLE!!!! Seriously check it out for yourself!!!!! Also, Gweneth Paltrow shows up right when the rest of the returnees of the MCU that were (Thanosed for lack of a better word),,, but she was never effected. She was just sitting out on the side the whole time while everyone was getting pummeled? Also incredibly, not one female MCU character is ever hit, touched, slammed, punched, assaulted at any point in the final giant battle by a male villain. Sure they get knocked around by a random ship laser blast, but they never have any direct negative physical confrontation, yet the male characters just happen to save the day. No funeral or remembrance for Black Widow?? Just a few of many examples of the very poor editing on this film which also shows how quickly this last picture was put together. Additionally the lack of ENDGAME dedication and thoroughness was totally obvious after my third viewing of this film. Insult to their millions of very loyal fans Even more with their added Bonus Footage to draw people back to the theater.... they still did not beat the 10 year old Avatar."
1895,"Definitely a step down from Infinity War. That being said it had to be the marvel movies can never end so theres no reason to care about the finality of any event. Truthfully, this movie would have had a much greater impact had this been the final MCU movie. Going inti theaters knowing this is just a mandatory stepping stone to the next movie took away any care I had about this movie. We knew RDJ and Chris Evans were most likely done so there was very little emotion behind their characters deaths. Black Widow was such a minor character her death and the interaction with Hawkeye felt so forced and emotionally unimpactful. I wish the time heist kinda plot would have been a larger part of the movie and just tightened up a bit. I did enjoy that as it was fresh and fun. I really enjoyed when we got a moment that really shrunk the massive mcu down to a very personal thing when the orginal 3 heroes fought Thanos. However in maybe the most apt analogy of the MCU a small relatable event spirals into a sensory overload of two million man armies. This movie was pretty standard marvel blockbuster fare. I found very few moments enjoyable and/or engaging. This movie does not deserve critical acclaim to this degree. I would not say its bad by any strech but it is certainly not one of the best movies ever.If cinema is an art form then this is a childs drawing on the fridge 5/10"
1896,"Got mixed feelings after watching it
Some moments were great like natasha's sacrifice and cap lifting the hammerSome were absolutely terrible.
They destroyed hulk and thor completely
Cap's ending was meh.
Captain marvel was of no use
Thanos seemed more powerful than in infinity war even though he didn't had the stones this timeInfinity war was better than endgame."
1897,This is the greatest MCU movie of mankind Captain america was awesome and made his character shine all you Back to the future Fans will love Hulks theory on time travel and the thanos ending fight is pure Cinematic excitement. this is probably the greatest no its the greatest movie i have seen in my 25 years living on this planet
1898,No superhero fan will be disappointed with this movie!
1899,How is this a good movie? I don't know. Story is very predictable. Jokes are not funny. I liked the other movies but this is one just bullsh**. Simple entertainment and not the best movie of the year.
1900,"From a fans' perspective, this has a lot of rewatchability value, but the plot holes bring down the whole franchise retrospectively. The directors took some creative choices that, for the most part, paid out, but watching this movie after the others in this franchise is a let down. Some heroes act out of character and although I felt the tension in the first couple of acts, the third one really didn't do nothing for me.
Infinity War was better constructed, but this had more heart."
1901,"""why is this a good movie?"". In the half of the playtime i was bored and already wondering, that they needed another hour and a half to tell the story behind this. I don' t want to spoiler anything and i'll remain quiet until the movie's airing is completed. But once you have seen it, please try to answer this simple question: ""why was this a good movie to you?"""
1902,"My son and I Loved infinity war 10 stars, great plot and character interaction, this one felt lacking in both. I'm glad others like it though, my kid who is 7 fell asleep 💤 at 1 hour, he asked me 40 mins in if it gets more interesting . When he awoke an hour later my answer was yes, but not much. Loved Captain America and the hammer, movie tingles in that scene. He might rate it lower?"
1903,"Film was very good but had some lazy writing and scenes, ironmans death was very sad, all in all a very good film but not as good as infinity war"
1904,"7/10I have been a mcu fan and have watched all the movies over the years. Some were better than others.
I certainly loved Infinity War. I laughed at the jokes and enjoyed the fast paced narrative. To me that movie still
represents the zenith of mcu. I have lost count of the number of times I have watched it.Thanos's actions were coherent and at no point did I feel that I need to put my brain in a jar to enjoy the movie.
The writing was very good.With Endgame the same is not true. The humor is simply not as good. The pacing is slow for the first 2 hours.How does it make sense for Thanos to destroy the gems? Does he not know that he will be a sitting duck without the Gems?
He has always wanted the power of the stones to make him the god that he wants to be. Not just to kill
half the population. But to rule the universe. So this movie somewhat misrepresents Thanos's character.Thor's appearance & conduct in this movie is an insult to the character. He deserves better than to be a joke.
I actually wanted to see more of Captain Marvel. But she just comes and goes. Why make an elaborate origin movie for her and then
have her play such a small role? Still her small contribution is actually entertaining to watch.
Even in the final battle, she plays a crucial role. In fact one gets the feeling that she has been deliberately sidestepped so that
other heroes get more screen time. Fact is if she can take down an entire space ship within seconds, what are the rest of
the Avengers going to do to make themselves useful? Lets hope the next phase of MCU shows us more of her.Then they have bunched together all the action in the final battle in the last 45 minutes where everyone fights Thanos and his army.
Those battle scenes are not as well choreographed as Infinity war. Also its hard to believe that Tony, Steve and Thor with both the hammers cannot fight
Thanos even when he has no gems. Whereas Thor alone nearly killed him in Infinity War.The best scene is between Cap Marvel and Thanos where he punches her hard and she doesn't even budge! Its like he hit metal!
We needed more of that. In the comics Thor is supposed to be stronger but here, she seems the strongest.I am not even going into all the paradoxes that time travel creates. You really have to completely stop asking rational questions there.
Overall many scenes seem contrived and designed to close out this chapter of MCU. Tony's death is actually unnecessary once he has all the Gems.
But his death is necessary for the future stories since he always occupies centre stage and in the future they probably want Cap Marvel or others to take on a leadership role for the Avengers.Overall, it's not as coherent as Infinity War but its fun and closes the chapter.
I just hope they bring back the coherent story telling with better writing in the next phase."
1905,The film I believe was good. It came back with good comic book lines and followed some of the story lines from them but in all I didn't like the ending of the mad titan.i think Infinity War was better.
1906,"Avengers : End Game was way too long. They could have wrapped up this story in 1hr 30min instead of stretching it out to 3hr. If you are less than a rabid fan I would recommend that you see this film at home. The crowd in my theater was attentive but strangely quiet and I didn't get much of a sense of excitement from the audience. Black Widow and Hawkeye had the best stories in this film and Ironman second. Ant man showed up and was fun and Rocket (the trash panda) represented the Guardians of the Galaxy (I'm a big Rocket fan 😊). I did not care for the Thor bit. I was disappointed with how they handled Thor's character - it just wasn't funny. The other Marvel characters showed up but the directors could have just set up cardboard cutouts and had voiceovers for all they contributed to the story line. It does not work as a stand-alone film - you have to have seen the previous films to understand it. I made my poor sister go to the movie with me (she had not seen all the previous films) and she felt tortured and bored (her words). She said that I now owe her ""big time"" Sheesh..."
1907,"It's all hyped that fail to deliver justice & it is No Brainer , This movie unlike its predecessor Endgame lacks a charismatic actions and focuses on emotional drama. Worse part of all is that mad Titan paying his life for an act which was not even committed.Note when ever things goes wrong Avenger uses Quantum machine which acts like a video game in which if players dies then respwan from their last checkpoint any given number of time."
1908,"I was ecstatic-- So ecstatic to see this film. But after just watching it. Honestly I don't know what to feel...The first 2+ hours was a snail's pace. I felt there were too much unnecessary dialogues. And being true to heart of watching all the Marvel movies, this one made me yawn at least 3 times.The ""good stuff"" only came towards the last hour. But even then the action sequences wasn't THAT great in comparison to Infinity War. It was a brief good entertainment to say the least...I believed the writers were trying to make it more of a sentimental kind of superhero movie instead. Which, don't get me wrong, it's a nice approach. As there were some touching moments and it can definitely bring out the tears (mostly likely affecting the sensitive folk) ...
I just felt it was a tad bit much (emotion > action). Maybe a nice balance of emotion and action would do be more suiting, as I've always felt this ""balance"" in the previous Avenger movies.All-in-all, it was still a good movie. Not that great as typically people would expect (from the overhype and all). The ending was a real nice touch to the franchise. Now THAT brought on the water-works. Salute to that!So thank you--- thank you to all those who've worked on Endgame. I believed you tried your very best and though it didn't satisfied me fully. It still left others happy, overall. So people, do give it a watch. As there's still some worth in it. *Salutes*"
1909,"Time travel? Really? Beating Thanos should have been more complex than some Quantum science theory. I wish all the hero could bleed more, suffer more, and win more rather than lost 2 of their pioneer. And what an easy hunch about the time travelling. Its twisting and turning but Infinity War way more better than this. And we lost capt marvel, the man-hulk and potts-rescue pin point storyline. Some jokes are really good I admit it. But..we are talking about Thanos, if u want beat him that easily just by doing Timeheist theory, then our hero should have more problem bigger than snapping the infinity gauntlet and everything back to normal. To be HONEST, i was really happy and yell ""YESS!"" from my seat when Thanos get his hand on the gauntlet one more time, because i hope, there will be another hero combo's between Dr. Strange & Capt. Marvel, or Black Panther & Ant Man etc etc etc. The pace also as an issue here, its okay to have a slow drama cinematic timeline (last time I got from Harry Potter last eps)
Conclusion, whatever Infinity War the score is, Endgame will always stay below it. Im sorry, its disappointing, REALLY! And im sad because i wait for too long for this"
1910,"I cannot exactly understand why everyone celebrates this movie as if it were genius. In my opinion, it is not. It's good, very good but not genius.Infinity war was epic. An epic tale, with great heroes and a terrifying and captivating villain. It was dramatic. Unexpected and intense things happened (Gamorrha death e.g.). Endgame does lack most of these cherries on the cake. Sure it gives us some great moments. The beginning made me feel again (Hawkeye, Tony's entrance etc.). However it stays within the realm of delivering nostalgia. It does not make enough use of the time travel plot. Not enough crazy mindbending storyline to offer. There are way better time travel stories out there. All this movie does while ""time traveling"" is getting nostalgic. Tony's demise was not that surprising nor was that everyone else was resurrected. The only crazy ""twist"" was Natasha dying.In between the movie also got kind of boring in my opinion. A feeling I never had once during Infinity war. Thanos did not feel like a huge threat nor did anything else. They could have made so much more mindbending twists of the time traveling but with the alternative reality direction etc. sure it's kind of set up to be uninteresting. (maybe thanos should have known all along? Maybe they should have made it a conflict of Tony having to decide between his life now and bringing the ""old way"" and people back? Maybe something else? But give me more final thrill and darkness, in such a final piece please). Captain Marvel felt entirely displaced. The only thing she does (again) is showing up and destroying spaceships. And some logic holes spanning the movie (e.g. at the end why are all of Peter's classmates still his age and nobody 5 years older--> highly unlikely outcome?).It maybe wasn't supposed to be another infinity war but except for Steve Rogers I am not sure anybody got Endgame here."
1911,"Pretty good movie overall but pretty bad since it's the end of an awesome saga. I really like Infinity War I was disappointed by Endgame...Hulk and Thor are jokes, too much humor for a movie wich was to suppose to be the darkest, a lot of paradoxes because of the time travel.I had a good time watching it but it lets me a bitter taste in mouth.."
1912,"I've been a superhero and comic fan since I was little and have enjoyed watching the entire cinematic Marvel Universe take shape. While there have been some excellent films and in my opinion some average films, the culmination was the amazing Infinity War. Infinity War delivered on nearly all fronts while I must say that Avengers: Endgame did not. Infinity War captured my undivided attention for its entire 2 hour and 40 minute run time with its mostly serious tone regarding the fate of Earth and its people. The same cannot be said for Endgame as it seemed to jump around often and mixed in a bit too much humor. The movie runs 3 hours and 2 hours of it are a convoluted story about the heroes troubles after the 'snap' and figuring out a plan to defeat Thanos while bringing back all of those lost. The last 45 minutes or so have a very good battle sequence with a mish mash of conclusions. The film focuses too much on fan service instead of creating a cohesive storyline. Spoilers below for a more in depth look at what worked and what didn't.***************************Spoilers Below**************************Best moments in the film:
The last 45 minutes overshadow the entire film and are by far and away the best part.
Heartfelt moments between Iron Man and Spider Man.
Captain Marvel trying to pull off the gauntlet and Thanos moving the power stone to the other hand to get him off of her looked amazing.
The nod from Doctor Strange to Iron Man knowing what the outcome would be was a fitting end.
A fine farewell for RDJ/Iron Man in the end considering Iron Man started the MCU.
Some of the humor from early on especially from Professor Hulk.
Good scene in having Cap turn over his shield to Falcon so that he can become the Next Captain America as he has done so in the comics.Negatives:
How often did time travel need to be discussed and tested? The entire plot revolving around this seemed awfully complicated and confusing. The first 2 hours were dreadfully slow and a bit unnecessary towards the overall arc of the movie.
Most characters barely played a role or had an impact in the movie. Yes they were around and popped up but most didn't do much of anything. I believe fans are more excited that they got to see everyone on the screen at the same time instead of realizing how little they contributed to the movie.
Black Widows death was not that impactful and is strange considering the talks of her potential solo movie.
Captain Marvel was definitely too over powered in the film.
Thor is now fat and it's hilarious to talk about his weight gain....talk about use of childish humor.
Seeing Professor Hulk was a treat but he was rather underutilized. He had a few funny moments in the film but he was rather insignificant in the battle once again due to a certain handicap. In Infinity War he refused to come out and now he was injured. A little weak for being such a huge part of the team.
Captain America wielding Thor's hammer and also harnessing the power of lightning? Yes I know Cap picks up the hammer and throws it in the comics but seeing him swing around the hammer and shoot lightning felt a little silly.
Speaking on the end battle, Thanos generals were also insignificant in the battle when they played key roles in fighting the Avengers.
Was Captain America's love story really that important to end the franchise on that note?"
1913,"Sorry guys but I have to give it 7 stars it was nice how they related everything together but like half the time they are showing us either older scenes or that they are sea
rching for the stones. And so many unanswered questions like how could they return the soul stone and is loki is still alive (which he should be ) and if they you guys remember in the infinity war when Dr strange removed the stone from the past to give it to Thanos so it must mean that they stuck in the same loop."
1914,"Infinity war was amazing. Our favorite heros bar maybe hulk at their best. In this movie we see the efforts of Iron man, Captain America and Thor equate to far less than the capabilities of Captain Marvel. Her character comes across as arrogant and she makes our favorite heros look puny. Thor is made into a joke(again). And there is a very unsubtle shoving of a feminist ideology in this movie. Marvel would be nothing without characters like Scarlett witch, black widow, the ladies of Wakanda, Nebula, Gamora and so much more however, Captain Marvel quite literally makes the efforts of our favorite heroes seem pointless. Nothing on infinity war. Disappointed but not entirely surprised as Disney also butchered Star Wars when they got their hands on it."
1915,"Predicted end !
Weak drama !
Graphics was not that high !Infinity war was way better than this !"
1916,"It's like Marcus and Mcfeely just said ef it and patched together some scenes to get to the final one that brings Thanos back to the center of the story. The only scene that really worked well was with Widow/Clint getting the soul stone which we all knew required one of them to die going in, so no big reveal here either.It's just sad that the Avengers wound up looking so ridiculous and so incompetent in light of the much better previous movies. The few scenes with Marvel are just junk, like Tony and Nebula couldn't come up with a fix for the ship and are just going to die in space.. just completely weak and witless writing to make Marvel the hero. Garbage. Writing Thor into a complete joke and making New Asgard look like a dumpy little fishing village, Hulk and Antman seem clueless other than just a ""lets DO SOMETHING' flash of mindless hysteria. Only Hawk is actually doing something that looks like accomplishment though we are given a 'morality lesson"" on the concept of vigilantism, I mean of course COMIC BOOK character need morality lessons. More garbage from the Fliege/Disney soy based milk toast comic reality devoid of traditional heroism.Of course one of the ALL TIME weakest plot devices in the history of plot devices is the one chosen here, time travel. Time travel has always been a weak link and poor option from the days of Star Trek whale saving to the modern Tom Cruise saves the day movies. Only the best written Doctor Who has remotely worked well in the time travel realm and then it was a mcguffin just better done than the other lame attempts.Bad writing and crapping all over the history of the Avengers by making them look incompetent and always needing a bail out, is really the story here, it's hard to describe how many failures popped up from the end of Iron Man and a last second appearance of Pepper who doesn't even look all that concerned to a weirdly executed Gomara plot twist that leaves you wondering what the eff they were thinking. So much poorly executed and failure spells a huge letdown for the MCU. Mercifully now it's over since we know the main characters are now done and gone. Maybe a Doc Strange of GotG movie will be worth catching, but not much else.Good bye MCU, what a shame you died such an embarrassing death and disrespectful ending from the so called creators, the Rousous and Fiege should truly be ashamed."
1917,"This is it , the man who started the mcu , i.e, ironman, yes it ended with him. This movie will be remembered for generations and generations, it's eternal, immortal, nothing can come bigger than this ."
1918,I had huge expectations after infinity war. This is moving was totally overrated and I couldn't get why they are trying to make 3 hour long.
1919,"#AvengersEndGameReview ⭐⭐⭐ Average Movie Worst Of Avenger Series 😠

1920,"I don't understand why people give 10/10 ? cuz of drama ? it's avengers not shawshank i expected a real plan against thanos but time travel ? it's like they tried to write a thanos plan but they failed so they said "" okay let's do time travel "". gg wp"
1921,"Avengers:Endgame,wasted all Avengers Series.
Very Poor story, pathetic twists, lots of ridiculous jokes and minimum action.
Hulk character is wasted
Arrogant Captain Marvel.
Waste of money
I dont recommend to see in Cinemas"
1922,"The build up and review puts this film on a par with the godfather, shawshank, etc etc. It's nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. Firstly, it's too long, secondly, it's too slow. Most importantly though, many of the things we came to love about the characters over the years they've messed with and ruined.It's all very well saying things must evolve but if the movie is going to standup to the ridiculously high ratings it's got then there still has to be some sort of timeless message that anyone could relate to. If not, then just keep the action high and the pace strong.The first avengers film was the best, and gradually they've just got worse and ran out of ideas. They went to the only thing they had left which was time travel, then made the sort of mess that reminded me of when Bobby Ewing appeared in the shower.Real shame."
1923,"Thor is spoiled in this movie.captain America is playing with Thor's hammer is likely very funny.
Thanos performance is very powerful.storyline is also average.....when you going to theatre not excepted very much."
1924,"I got disappointed about Thor and Hulk. And the Directors of Marvel for making the Thor and Hulk too weak.
The reason i went first day first show because to see Thor.
Russo brothers is suck."
1925,"There are two things that MCU got absolutely right in Endgame, it's marketing and the number of superheroes in the movie. Otherwise, it's a predictable, mediocre and just any other movie, made only for the fans with a lot of efforts. And I would definitely rate it lesser than Infinity War and Civil War.Instead of making huge debate, I'll just prove my point in bullets below:-They ruined Thor for everyone, he's just a comedy gimmick from now on.
-After watching A4, I believe the Infinity war should have ended at killing Thanos at his 'Garden' with Avengers losing 'absolutely all hopes'. That starting in A4 seemed pretty forced and misplaced to me, rather it should have started after 5 years.
-The whole idea of original avenger's stories coming to conclusion seems very forced especially Captain remaining behind in past.
-Natasha and Clint's so called emotional sequence where she dies, is one of the lowest point of the movie.
-Lets not even talk about Time Travel, I believe it was the easiest way they could write this movie. It seems very non sensical.
-Movie seemed burdened with its own weight of being emotional comedy yet action packed. At points you'll feel that it's unnecessary and even not that funny.
-One of the biggest flaw is that it's only made for fans, unlike previous 3 avengers. There are far too many references, that only fans will understand. As few critics put it, a fan service. Having said that, if you're a fan, you'll love it like hell.
-The final battle is the selling point, that's what all fans wanted to see.
-They did exactly what I was afraid of, undo the snap. Which translates to undo the previous movie. That's not something they should have done, again a lazy script.
-As engaging as IW was because of its plot, this one is only engaging for it's one liners. Again, that too only for fans because you won't enjoy if you haven't seen previous ones.It's a good movie, but unfortunately doesn't live up to the quality of Infinity War. That's just sad."
1926,"A love story to end all the 6 original heroes was an unexpected story telling brilliance. Cap wielding Mjölnir, awesome. Cap gotta live a full life with Peggy, awesome. Professor Hulk pretending to smash in NY, awesome. Fat Thor, awesome. Iron Man married with Pepper and a kid, awesome. Iron Man died saving everyone (asides from the rat and Ken Jeong who are the true heroes), awesome.I love the the whole MCU franchise, the characters, story telling and all, but I want to be honest about Endgame.Solely from a movie entertainment perspective, it's not entertaining like Infinity War, Civil War, Guardians Vol.1 & 2, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Ragnarok or even Avatar (since everyone is raving about beating that movie). I walked out feeling satisfied and grateful they did justice wrapping up all 6 characters honourably except Black Widow (she just like died there and that's that WHAT!), but also feeling extremely unsatisfied asking myself ""So, now what?"". The whole 3 hours are mostly about how to close the 6 heroes arc properly while peppering in killing Thanos and bringing the rest back.I know the studio made a call to give this Infinity Saga a respectful bowing out and curtains down moment by not having any future tease, but as a movie goer and MCU fan, I much prefer to know what I will get next instead of a that's it we're done moment. It's like they are telling me OK... now you can go chase other franchise cos Marvel is finished. We're done. Thanks for following us for 11 years and now you can go.Endgame left me with both emotions - happy they did justice to the story/heroes arc, disappointed they left me alone with nothing else to hope for next."
1927,"Let me tell you why infinity war was better than this. Endgame sucked at the end actually.
Points:
1. At the end, Thanos came from past, but had no gauntlet. All of the avengers came to fight him and his army. Thor had both Hammer as well as Axe. Yet, they were unable to beat thanos who was without gauntlet.
2. Hulk got a beating of his life from thanos in infinity war, and yet, Dr. Hulk was not given a chance to fight Thanos. No revenge.Endgame sucked in emotions.
1. Thor went to asgard in time travel. He saw his mother, and the emotions were like nothing. It was like normal for him.
2. Tony died at the end, but pepper who just came to him, shed 1 or maybe no tears and a kiss to forehead. What? Where was the emotions here for her?
3. One more I remember. When Clint and Black widow are thinking who will get sacrificed. Man! When black widow died, look at Clints emotions. Just like fake weeping. I challenge you to match it with Thanos's sacrifice for soul stone and look at his emotions from infinity war. Believe it or not, I felt that Thanos's emotion. Even, I felt weeping.In the beginning, the avengers acted like Cowards.
1. Thanos, who was very sick by destroying stones. They just came to him and chopped his head off. Okay. Revenge is a beautiful thing. But that looked like a coward act.Good points:
1. The meeting between Iron man and his father in past.
2. Cap vs cap in past.
3. All those past scenes were a thing of beauty.I am not a director, but I felt the movie could have been better. How? Maybe having avengers fight the all powerful thanos at the end who has say all stones but snap couldn't work for sometime till the infinity stones gain their power back after first snap.They fight the powerful thanos. At the end, it looked like a one way fight where avengers were clear winners. Man! Why didn't they made thanos more powerful again somehow.
Damnit! He was fighting all avengers with no gauntlet."
1928,A solid beautifull beginning... If you have everything of marvel this will be a beautiful ending.. There is always a but... It's not worth mentioning it... Just go see it's every comic readers wet dream come true😂👍
1929,A perfect blend of all Marvel super Heroes in One movie ....Thats the Avengers End Game
1930,"One of the best movies I have ever watched ... ""Avengers : Endgame"" is the best Ending of 10 years of The MCU .. the movie was dramatic not just a superhero movie which the heros win at the end, No the movie has drama and the acting was too good from all the characters .. That's why I liked so much, It Isn't like any superhero film, It Was Epic !"
1931,"No comment needed.Best MCU ever. Chris Evans i love you. Robert downey jr you're da bomb. Chris Hemsworth. Scharlett johanson, she is my spirit animal."
1932,"You remember, when kids, how cool it was when Bruce Banner got mad and became hulk without control? How cool the old spiderman movies were (tobey mcguire as actor)? Superhero movies have become franchising for kids, making them more funny than how they were before and they just feel different. I can really see that they are targeting little kids. These movies are NOT anymore for older people too.This movie was most of the time trying to be funny, sometime being, but the superhero part was just not feeling like it made me feel years ago (even the first avenger movie was cool). That feeling of ""Omg, wow, this gavee me goosebumps"" is gone with Marvel's movies.
Hulk that became rational and not anymore the violent Irrational beast? Thor fat and drunk? Other characters just boring. Superheroes movies don't feel like it anymore. They are cute for little kids but I felt really stupid watching it as a 25 years old."
1933,It seems arbitrary to review a movie like this. It's not a movie it's a journey. I watched MCU movies over 5 years before this and it is a great conclusion. I can't say you'll love it and it's easy to nitpick but its good. Seeing it in the theater was an experience I will never get again. Sincerely recommended.
1934,"They definitely could've condensed this film into around 2hrs. The first two hours were filled with a bunch of chatter that didn't do anything but fill in time. As well as the last hour like everyone said, same ol stuff."
1935,"If you see the whole adventure, we must admit MCU travel was really really best and complex, no alternative could cover it. But personally, I don't think Avengers Endgame is the best MCU movie so far. To me, ""The Avengers"" was the best. Let me write about it1. The Avengers
2. Thor Ragnarok
3. Avengers Infinity War
4. Black Panther
5. Captain America The Winter Soldier"
1936,"I read a lot of comments in here and i saw a lot of 10... the movie is not bad, not for a normal movie... but guys... it's an Avenger. 10 means perfection, and Avengers: Endgame is everything except perfect... I presume that mosts of 10 are because it's the last chapter of a great, great story...Based on what i've seen until now from the Marvel, this movie could be the greateest of all time, even better than Infinity War, but I presume they wanted to close it fast. There are some mistakes, for my point of view, that could be avoided just by watching the movie.Too many errors, or at least, too many things unexpained... like ""why does Cap go back in the past and appear in the future while Thanos come into the present but is still present in the past he left?"" or ""where does Spiderman attach his web in the last battle?"" or ""we're talking about the Infinity Stones... they almost destroied Thanos arm with the gauntlet created by some kind of god-dwarves with some kind of star... how isn't Tony Stark deleted from the existence when he snaps his finders and still have his talking scene? He is a human, with an homemade gauntlet"" and the most of all things... ""If Infinity Stones are like Dragon balls, you can ask for what you want... why the hell Thanos didn't ask for unlimited resources instead of killing half of... all???""By the way, if u watch Endgame without thinking too much, you will find that the movie is great.
The cast is amazing as always, you can't say anything on the cgi and there is a lot to see."
1937,"Avengers: Infinity War better than this movie.
A film that cannot meet expectations."
1938,First half is too long and boring . Thor has been Made a caricature. Too much of importance to captain America and hulk also not used properly. Too much of focus on iron man and takes too long and even make us bore and walk out of film
1939,"I was hoping that Endgame would be an intelligent and fun conclusion to the Avengers saga. I was sadly disappointed. The ""Hulk professor"" was ridiculous. The fat Thor was totally stupid. It took almost 2 hours for anything of significance to happen. The story was contrived and lazy. If I wanted a trip down memory lane I would have re-watched earlier movies. The whole Captain Marvel thing didn't work at all. Infinity War was awesome. Endgame felt like watching the last 20 minutes of Return of the King for 3 hours. If you're not a super hero geek then this movie is just plain boring and silly. The only reason to see this is to spend time with your family."
1940,"My quick summary of Engame:
How is Thanos so damn powerful all of a sudden?
Why spend 10 years explaining the power of Caps Shield and Thors Hammer n Stormbreaker only for Thanos to show up with a random weapon that is unexplained and is way more powerful?
How is Sam the new Cap when hes not a super soldier but a normal human, especially considering all the epic encounters Cap went through now we have to believe that Sam is of similar strength n stature?
And my biggest question... Why the hell did the MCU introduce Captain Marvel at the end of Infinity War like she was going to be the saviour ( even giving her a solo movie ) then only using her for a total of 5 mins screentime in Endgame which ended with her struggling to beat Thanos n then getting blasted?? What was the point of that? Shouldve just saved her for phase 4! Shes basically the Superman of the MCU but cant match Thanos?i scratch my head..??"
1941,"I actually like the first 40 minutes which, whilst quite slow, at least had coherent plot.After that, the whole thing because rather convoluted with disparate mini stories and occasionally contrived encounters and moments. It all just became very messy. And whilst Back to the Future was derided, that actually had a much more workable narrative. Okay, we can get it that the Quantum realm might be like that but that doesn't make it good for film. Narratively it threw up so many unanswered questions and loopholes.I liked MCU best when they kept it simple, and humorous. Iron Man was a brilliant movie. Guardians, Thor Ragnarok and (yes I'll say it) even Captain Marvel were coherent stories, well told. This was all very messy. It rather lost its way too many times."
1942,I enjoyed certain parts . But admit I left the cinema feeling meh. Thought the pacing was off took too long to get into its stride. relegated Thor and hulk to comedy sidekick roles. And seemed to get itself all confused in the time travel storyline. Was hoping for better.
1943,Not sure whether they were trying to be drama or action movie. Tried to build character development and hence made it too slow. In fact could have trimmed 30 minutes off the movie.The time travel bit was no surprise I guessed beforehand that was the only way they could get out of the situation. It was handled ok.Great CGI and action scenes.In the end I guess I was expecting more of an action movie than a character development move.
1944,"The soon-to-be most successful movie of all times actually ranks fairly low among its companions. I'd say it is about as good as Winter Soldier.
As a fan of the pevious films, expecially Infinity War, I couldn't miss this one. I think that goes for most movie-goers. After Infinity War, we HAD to see how it ends. Infinity War was an almost perfect movie.
And now we get less than perfect. Now, we get ""good"" or ""very good"" and in comparison it seems almost bad.
My issue is not how the film is made. But with the story they chose to tell:
1. Thanos can't be the stronger villain without his gauntlet. That's poor writing.
2. Captain Marvel and Captain America are NOT equally strong (when fighting Thanos).
3. Stormbreaker was this amazing weapon in Infinity War. It beat Thanos with all stones in his gauntlet. Now it's just as steong as the hammer.
4. Thor has just found his purpose and strength in Ragnarok and Infinity War. Now he is a joke.
5. The time travel is, well, how itz always is. Hardly logical.
Those are the issues that now trouble me after having seen it two days ago. It just wasn't as good as Infinity War. They missed their mark."
1945,"Okay, firstly, this was a stunning movie, it looked really beautiful throughout. That being said, I thought Infinity War was a far superior story than this one. I am not really complaining, because I don't think any sequel could have been better than Infinity War. I don't like time travel as a means of solving things, or at least, it really needs to be done well for me to appreciate using it (Interstellar did it well). I thought initially they could have done it well, because I mentioned that you cannot change the past, but then that is exactly what they ended up doing. Also, why was Captain America able to use Thor's hammer? In fact, why did Thor take it from Asgard in the first place? Wouldn't that leave the past Thor hammerless? I feel like they played it a bit fast and lose with consistency in terms of what the characters could and should have done and be able to do. This movie left me a little confused about Thanos' power because he was pretty powerful without the stones. Also, I really wish they would have had more heroes die. I mean they fought an army and only Nat, who sacrificed herself, and Tony, who died from his own actions, died, that just seems a copout to me and unrealistic. It would have been more emotional if a bunch of heroes had died during the battle at the end."
1946,"At the end of this overlong movie, I was okay with the series ending.I found it rather bland. A three-hour-wake to the series. I wasn't really involved in any of it. The plot was not what I had expected, and even if I found the time travel idea nice, what they did with it was nah. And don't you EVER slag Back To The Future.Endgame started with and continued to have too little action, too little FUN, too much 'oh woe is me', too little time travel explained, too little plot, too slow.It was one looooong wake, to the series, to Iron-Man, maybe to Stan. Make love not war! A send-off. With lots of male depression. Yawn. At times I felt I was watching a Hallmark movie.Captain Marvel was just an Iron-Man retriever. lolEverything was well-acted, yes. But even though I do appreciate slow play and character studies, it seemed wrong in this final film. Jeez. Doom and Gloom. Sitting around moping, or killing baddies all over the world, or starting a self-help group....Yawn. Really. That's what they come up with?? Was it supposed to be funny? Was it supposed to be poignant?
Well it wasn't. The survivors of The Snap did erect a huge, spotless, visited memorial, but they cannot collect the trash? Like people would stop caring. Silly. People die every day, there is tragedy around us, and people deal with it. That's what people do. Yes, you can off yourself or go into depression, but I am convinced the majority would 'make the best of it' - adapt, carry on.You know, after GOT 08/03 last Monday this one was a borefest. That one had horrible picture quality, but much more drama with less words."
1947,"Whyy??? they brought back same fabula.
A triumph of sorts. Not of acting: with some notable exceptions - a beer-bellied, tragicomic Chris Hemsworth as Thor among them - a feeling of exhaustion has crept in with a number of the principals over the 10 or so years since Iron Man set this gargantuan, quippy super-opera in motion. Nor of dialogue: not even Don Cheadle can deliver a line like ""We are all about that superhero life,"" and the little speeches tend to fall flat, to the point where the film gets self-conscious about them. Nor of direction: for the first hour or so, the Russo brothers rely heavily on your good will toward the superfolk who remain in the wake of ""blue meanie"" Thanos' halving of the universe's population, and the relentless stream of fan service in the two hours that follow may leave even the truest believer feeling milked. But a triumph of feeling: of itches scratched, of sorrows and angers eased, even of longings fulfilled. A triumph of theme: the team's time-travel gambit hammers home the Why We Fight virtues of home and hearth, of Mom and Dad and the kids. And above all, a triumph of plotting: thread after narrative thread tied off in neat and sometimes unexpected (and unexpectedly satisfying) fashion. The MCU will go on and on, but this chapter - and the American pragmatism vs. American ideals bromance that drove it - have well and truly come to their ""Excelsior! Nuff said!"" moment."
1948,Expectations always comes with a slightly disappointment
1949,"Although it was a satisfying ending of the same characters in MCU, other important protagonists get sidelined in ridiculous ways. The ending was very emotional, but the road there was a bumpy one. The Russo's did not capture the magic they did with Infinity War, but I guess it was good enough."
1950,"The movie is fun and entertaining overall. But it is supposed to tie up all the loose ends of the previous films of this franchise, which contradicts with a lot of plots
of this particular film. Maybe we should just turn a blind eye and give it a pass because this ending can't be more epic or whatever, but this is the one movie we've waited for so long for me to say like, that's such a great way to tie it up and all. Because it's not. There are so many inconsistencies and cringy moments in this movie. And it doesn't give me the feeling of Infinity War or Cival War. The level of conflict is just not there. So to sum it up, it is kinda enjoyable as a comedy, but I'm personally not satisfied in a whole bunch of ways."
1951,"I've been watching the MCU movies since they all came out and even though I'm more into DC comics, I loved the MCU ones.
When Infinity War came out, I kept saying that it was a master piece.
Months later we see trailers for Endgame and I got excited.
Like most of us, I watched some of the fan theories out there and that got me even more excited. Of course, I wasn't expecting any of the theories to be true, but still they were all interesting and very cool.
Endgame comes out and it's 3 hours long.
I went with a couple of friends who are true fans and we watched the entire thing.
Now, the movie wasn't all that bad but...beloved characters such as Thor and Hulk were absolutely useless to say the least in this movie with the exception of 2-3 scenes they took part in.
I felt like some of the scenes were just fillers for other, older movies, rather than new material that would explain something epic and cool.
Unfortunately, the movie was disappointing in many aspects such as
Poor character development.I felt like it was running. A 3 HOUR MOVIE MADE ME FEEL LIKE IT WAS RUNNING.It was quite obvious who's gonna stay alive and who's gonna die, moments before their time even came on the screen.Some of the strongest characters were left out a lot.There was simply no reason to introduce Captain Marvel in the MCU if she wasn't going to do more than 2 minutes of screen time."
1952,"First off, 'Endgame' is definitely worth watching. It is hard to overestimate the cinematic achievements demonstrated in the movie. It pays tribute to all the plotlines that had been leading up to this culmination through the years. There are some exceptional and iconic scenes which will surely command admiration of many Marvel fans to come.There are moments to rejoice, there are moments to cry, there are moments to laugh, there are moments to appreciate the fact that you are a contemporary of the people involved in bringing this whole universe to life and that you can experience all this first-hand.Judging the film by its own merits, however, is a different story. It felt like the directors wanted to seize this 'last' chance and do homage to so many characters and so many things that in the end we are left with this motley crew of multiple episodes and actions stuffed in one wannabe epic finale.With all its charge and glory, 'Avengers: Endgame' does not surpass 'Infinity War'. After that masterful fight on Titan, turning a black hole into butterflies bears no comparison to taming... a river."
1953,"If you go into this movie thinking that you're going to get an Infinity Wars part II I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed. I enjoyed the movie, but I was hoping for so much more, and yes, I know, when you go into a movie with high expectations the chances are that you're setting yourself up for disappointment, but the more I think about this movie the more I hate the direction it took.
Now..obvious mistakes aside (Capt America with the power of lightning?...really??...it was literally explained in Ragnarok) the way they destroyed some of the best characters was completely frustrating, Lebowski Thor?....Slimey Hulk?.......a Thanos that you couldn't empathise with even though you knew it was wrong?.....meh....
The thing is, once you introduce time travel into a movie you're going to spend the rest of your days wondering 'why didn't they just....' unless it's done really intelligently, unfortunately this falls very short of that mark, and as whole...when I think about the film now, it just feels like a bit of an over emotional fan film, an MCU scrapbook of nostalgia that despite being 3 hours long...still felt incredibly rushed.
The biggest moment in ten years of Marvel movies was 'The Snap' ...yet in Endgame you don't even get to see any of effect of reversing it??....apart from a phone call from Hawkeye's wife?....baffling.
Throughout most of this film I felt like I was watching a parody, it's something you still have to watch.....and you'll probably enjoy it, just as long as you don't think about it afterwards."
1954,"Good movie, but the previous one was better.It was enjoyable but not as exciting as the one before."
1955,"This is an above average movie. I recommend you see it in theatres, but don't get your hopes up as far as it being an amazing experience. If you have a good crowd then it will definitely help in your experience!"
1956,"This is going to be unpopular opinion but after reading many of these reviews, it may not become unpopular. I will do the best I can to keep this spoiler free. There are obvious plot holes that will drive many MCU & non MCU fans nuts. Also, the movie starts off very slow and never really takes off for 2 hours. While there were emotional scenes & good actions scenes near & in the end of the film, it doesn't fully deliver its full potential throughout. Some of the superheroes barely get any screen time as well & you'll see why many people complain about Thor's obnoxious behavior. While it may to tempting to bash this movie to bits and give it a 5, I respect the ideas, acting, music, CGI, & work that was put into this. It definitely wasn't half a**ed but also wasn't completely solid either. Overall, you will most definitely be entertained and leave the theater with a smile on your face most likely but soon realize Infinity War is sooooo much better & more memorable due to its comedy, action, CGI, equal use of superheroes, plot, & the memorable Thanos. However, this movie didn't irritate me enough for me to hate on it. If you have kids tho, this movie will be a blast for them as my theater had kids hollering & emotional. 7/10 for my rating."
1957,"Even before trailer and movie was released, I already figured it out. That they'll go back in time and save everyone. Overall movie is a good one time watch but not worth that much of hype. For no reason they killed two of the heroes especially iron man."
1958,The movie has a slow two hour start. The time travel thing was a bad idea. The end was good and saves the movie from receiving a six rating.
1959,"Avengers: Endgame is not a bad movie at all. It's just not what it's made out to be - supposedly one of the greatest movies of all time. Sure, you have seasoned actors who deliver the necessary emotions which are put into scene well enough and several strings from other movies and tv series are tied together. But that alone doesn't make a movie great per se, that's just good planning.The story itself is your basic time travel retcon and there aren't any clever twists that were hidden in Infinity War. 2 out of 3 hours of the movie is characters talking as a fan service, one hour is plot advancement. You get your deus ex machina (Captain Marvel) who tips the balance this time while she was conveniently absent in the last movie. You get Iron Man, who doesn't even have superhuman abilities, performing a feat that should have killed him right away according to the lore.The movie is satisfying yes, but that doesn't make it great. Nothing of what happens is particularly awe inspiring, surprising or new. With all the talking, it rather feels like a double episode that finishes off a tv show.And to be honest, placing this among the greatest movies of all time feels like an insult to the great ones which excel in all possible departments - acting, story, score, cinematogrpahy, blocking etc. But I guess a generation that votes for a president who promises to make America great again can also vote such a movie as one of the greatest. Both aren't."
1960,"A bit like a compilation album, some really great tracks but generally just filler. Cinematically it was epic, spectacular, CGI filled superhero awesomeness but the film was slow to start (after a brilliant emotional first 15 mins) and I was mostly underwhelmed by the plot. I felt Thor was ruined by the joke and some parts were just cameos for the sake of it. I did sob with my son at the saddest part, but I still feel a bit... meh.... maybe I need to watch it again to see if it's better second time around!"
1961,Wow! This movie will blow you away. You will feel every human emotion in this movie. It's a must watch!
1962,"I think my problem with this movie is there was SO MUCH STORY to cover that much of the screen time is devoted to exposition and tying up loose ends- too much of the movie feels more like an obligation than an adventure.My other complaint is that there were some fantastic ideas presented in the film that don't quite play out to their potential. It still get points for introducing the ideas at all, but ultimately they left me a touch disappointed.But honestly, I can't imagine how they could've done things any differently (just like Dr. Strange said! There was only one way for this to end!).I won't ruin the ending, but I'll just say it's clear that ACT 3 is where the filmmakers put all of their attention, and it pays off VERY well.I think Infinity War is a far superior movie in terms of writing, editing, and overall fun, but this movie will still satisfy fans.Bitter sweet see the end of a 10 year era of movie-making, but it was great to be along for the ride."
1963,"I'll keep this simple.It's nowhere near as good as Infinity Wars.The whole time travel aspect was poorly executed, it was very predictable and Captain Marvel's involvement was a bit ridiculous (I could easily help you win, but I'm busy so I'll be back in 2.5 hours).It's a fun watch, but that's about it."
1964,"Endgame 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 Don't watch it with preconceived notions of what it's going to be. Forgive it's minor faults, it's a bloody great super hero movie."
1965,"Redundant plot, unnecessary long, unexplainable events and meaningless humour!"
1966,"I would like to start by saying I'm a huge MCU fan. I completely get why people love this movie! it's a fun, end to a adventure that has been a part of many peoples lives for a long span of time. It is a great movie however it escapes me how people can watch this movie and not see huge flaws with the it. The best thing I can say is stuff just doesn't make sense.*Stuff in shots that isn't there in the next shot. *Simple story explanations were not present.
*overall the story felt bland actually.With that said, overall you will have a good time watching the movie."
1967,"This is my least favorite marvel movie but most of them are great. I really didn't like the hulk thing and I quess Thor was ok, I did not like oh the whole movie he was really mopey"
1968,"They must kill Thanos through time travel. The end. Endgame is nothing more than just an okay film but with a very disappointing conclusion. Figure it out yourself. The fake a·· CGI action was nice and the story was not bad but, oh god, do I hate it when they implement feminism into the mix. Yes, the future of the MCU is an emasculating bloody tampon and the bad a··es I am reluctant to accept is a shrieking ugly b····. God! Anyways, other disappointments is what they did to Thor and Hulk, making them look like basement dwelling soylent sucking dingle berries. Sorry, but I like my action heroes manly and testosterone driven. Not gay. Overall, Endgame wasn't too bad but, really, it's not even close to an 8.5 rating as currently given. So pathetic."
1969,History tries to impose on me a drama that does not convince me. This leaves tedious several parts of the movie.
1970,Very weak storyline....disappointed to see such an ending of this beautiful series.
1971,Avengers endgame is one of a kind well done Marvel studios
1972,"The film is 3 hours long and most of that are mostly unfunny jokes and dialogue, compare this to infinity war which got to the point. The film kinda ruins characters like the hulk aka Bruce banner, thor, and Thanos, however it does make characters like Nebula and Hawkeye better. The music isn't that special, just generic marvel music, the CGI is fine, and the acting is tolerable. The choice to have the plot revolve around time is strange, and it makes me wonder if the Russo brothers just wanted to go for shock value than a straight forward plot like their other mcu movie. It ain't one of the worst, but not one of the best."
1973,"I trully an not exactly sure how i feel about this movie. After the huge surprise that was Infinity War, i genuinely didn't know if they could do something to top that movie. And... they didn't. Don't get me wrong Avengers: Endgame is a very fun movie that tries to be more serious than regular Marvel movies and just like Infinity War tries to balance a lot of different characters. The ending is a great tribute to RDJs iconic Iron Man role and it does feel like the massive conclusion of a cinematic universe that has been building up to this movie for more than 10 years. However it is flawed in many apsects. First and foremost, the movie has too many plotholes and honestly the whole time travel thing makes no sense if you think about it for more than a minute (granted that always happens with time travel but still) (also Tony Stark straight up invents time travel in an evening). Thor became a proper joke in this movie, which is a shame considering he peaked in Infinity War. Yes, it made sense for the narrative but they absolutely ridiculed him. Also i expected a bit more than fat jokes. Speaking of jokes the humour is good in this movie, but a lot of jokes just don't land... at all. As far as other characters are concerned, Black Widow is in the movie just to die and Captain America going in the past to live a normal life was a horrendous choice, and something extremely uncharacteristic of him. The rest of the characters were dealt with preety well, i especially liked what they did with Hulk, since having him be just a smashing machine again would be boring. My biggest complain though is surprisingly the action, which i found supbar ! Especially the final fight was just a massive chi slugfest, which makes sense considering there where so many characters on screen. Also the cgi is surprisingly weak on some points! I personally would have preferred if instead of another huge fight with a billion different characters and useless armies we got a showdown between the original 6 Avengers and Thanos and The Black Order, while the rest were fighting off the generic army. Thanos also felt a bit less threatening than before and also a bit more stupid and a lot more reckless. And the Black Order was barely even used, for some reason. Furthermore, a lot of moments clearly happened just for the sake a fan service, which i didn't like at all. Finally, though i enjoyed the direction of the film, i found the score and cinematography to be good but extremely basic. All in all, Avengers: Endgame serves as a nice conclusion to a massive chapter of a franchise, which however features a plethora of flaws amd ultimately doesn't bring anything new to the table. I'll give this movie a 6.5/10"
1974,"A fitting end to a 22 movie story. It is not a full blown action packed Avengers movie, but what it does, and it does it very well, is wrap up everything in close to 3 hours with respect to everything that's gone before it.
No spoilers here, but you'll enjoy the action, laugh at the humour and it will (probably) make you sad in parts. Loved the last couple of scenes especially. It's unusual to be able to watch 2 excellent films in 1 week (Joker being the other)."
1975,"This movie picks up after the devestating events of infinity War that wiped out half of all living creatures.
In this movie you can really feel a sense of urgency from the avengers. And the way the characters are taken is all very pleasing. The acting is some of the best in an avengers film. The 3 hour run time is not a problem what's ever and I could've happily sat watching it for 5 or even 6 hours without feeling it dragging on."
1976,This film was done so well. The 3rd act I will say in my lifetime will never happen again. This movie brings all the feelings inside to life 10 fold. I love this movie
1977,"First off... SMART HULK IS AN ACTUAL THING IN THE MARVEL COMICS (PROFESSOR HULK)! It is clear to see that there are repeated ine star reviews for this film by haters because they say the same damn thing. This is why you cant get a film rating off the internet. Users abuse this, idk if theyre just DC fanboys but whatever the issue is, in no world does this film earn 1 star.Endgame was a beautiful end to a saga, it had everything you want in a film from comedy to drama and action. I'd rather not give away too much if you've not seen the film but I'd give it a solid 8 or 9 stars. Going with 10 to counter some of these bullsh** reviews"
1978,"I was shocked, I seriously expected the worst for this movie and even held off watching it for ages after it came out because people just said it was so poorly done but in reality it was quite spectacular, for me anyway. I'm content with how this movie went and ended."
1979,"When I say that Avengers Engame is the most overrated movie of 2019, I mean that people and critics praised it more, the movie, yes, you could say that it is ""good"", but not so much for everyone to go crazy and say that it is the best superhero movie, a great example of how overrated it would be like, this movie was recently titled as the highest grossing movie in the history of cinema in general. Yes, if the film is very striking with its colors and all those characters, but simply what in Avengers Infinity War ""struggled"" to maintain the quality of the plot, here it simply does not matter, I just say that Captain Marvel suddenly find Tony and the other lady, they do not explain at any time how he did to find them, yes, if I know that the marvel lovers have already drawn their theories on that, to cover up the lazy mistakes of the writers. In Infinity War we saw the Thor plus Thor of the Thores, but now he is an obese alcoholic, the movie is not taken seriously sometimes, and that is a great example, or that Tony gets angry at first with Captain America because he does not It was there, blah, blah, blah, but if we use our brains, you will remember that in Infinity War he had the opportunity to call him and he did not, so I'm sorry Iron man lovers, but Tony had no right to get angry, and if we analyzed him well really Captain Marvel was a filler character, we all believed that this character would have great weight for the story but no, I thought that they did not try hard in their movie because they were going to want all this, but no, you can feel that the writers they didn't know what to do with it, and something they did go over with was the rat that accidentally released Ant-man, I'm just saying that you are more likely to see a cow flying outside your house to have that happen, which I leave wondering if the truck was closed, then how did that rat could get in? The time travel is very badly done, quantum physics clearly says that two equal objects cannot be together at the same time in the same place, so that fight of the American captains is impossible, and the rest is not even said , for example, Captain America in the end stays in the past meaning that The Avengers never had Captain America, which means that everything he did never happens, which leaves me wondering. Why did nothing change? Why is there no temporary paradox or any consequence for your decision? It's simple, the movie is so shameless in the sense that it doesn't care about those rules and does what it gives the gift wins. After that for no reason, Steve gives his position to Falcon because ............. in order to make a reference to the comics, he prefers to give his position to an African-American who he met recently Than your lifelong friend. Something that I honestly didn't understand, was how the gauntlet works, are you supposed to think about what you want and what happens? I don't know, I think, because Hulk throne his fingers and half of the universe that had disappeared comes back, but here goes the problem, if you think about it that is the worst thing he had to do, Thanos technically had already saved the universe by reducing the population , and that was something that the Avengers failed to understand, but that is the least, the problem is that being logical, of that half world literally literally, I wonder where the hell are all these people going to live? 5 years have passed and obviously their houses must already be inhabited by someone else, or their jobs, and logically they should have had an economic imbalance, but hey, the Avengers don't care about that and they are happy because they saved their friends, just I say his plan was very selfish. If you think about it really, the one who lost the most was Thanos, his goal was really not bad, that for starters, even in a part of the movie Steve tells Natasha something that the planet is less polluted Thanos was looking for his stones for a long time time and when he found the last one to get it he had to sacrifice his daughter, he also lost his friends, henchmen or not dry were, then after saving the universe, he just wanted to live in peace and eat his broth, but the Avengers do not arrive and they kill him, then they make a plan for all their sacrifices to go to waste, poor Thanos. To tell the truth that Hulk is now Hulk-Banner does not really bother me, what I would have liked is that they would have spent time on that, for example a movie of that would not be bad. But well now talk about how good this movie has, and I'd like to start with those little big details, which would be like Hulk uses a pencil to press the keys because his fingers are too big, or that Iron Man gives the hug to that Spiderman did not want to give him at Homecomeming, also that Bucky tells Steve that he is going to miss him although he is supposed to only leave for a few seconds, but it is because he knows him enough to know that Steve is going to live his life, and that that would be the last time he sees him young and for me that he is the best he would be being that in the final battle with Thanos, Thor every blow he hits is directed at Thanos's head. And as brave as it has been to kill Ironman, it was really a bit forced, although the only thing I managed to sacrifice was to avoid the salvation of the universe. I will analyze the advantage and cons. Pros: -Give more years of life to humanity before it destroys itself. -They managed to complete their goal. Cons: -To condemn humanity. -Leave his wife a widow. -Let your daughter an orphan. - Wreck the work of a visionary. -Kill oneself. But the point is that the greatest hero of Marvel was sacrificed, the man who created Ultron, the man who caused the civil war between his companions and then locked them in, the man who created all those marvel villains like the Vulture , Mystery, Mandarin, etc. But hey, goodbye Ironman. So and I have two questions for marvel lovers. How is it possible for a human being to create a gauntlet that supports the gems of infinity, when Infinity War told us that only a certain metal made by certain dwarves can do it? The only conclusion I reach is that Tony is a god or a celestial being. I also understand that if he is a god, he would be Ojo de Alcon, since he is in a moment of the movie he grabs a gem of the infinite with his hand and in guardians of the galaxy I learned that only a celestial or a god can grab the gems without dying, and in this movie, Ojo de alcon grabs it and nothing happens, so I understand that this man is a god or a celestial. Do not? Something that I admire about this movie is that it is very good lying, to this I mean that it is so good lying that it made half the world believe that it is the best film not only of the year, not only of the genre of Super-heroes, but of the best movies in history, they are good lying that with the jokes, the characters, the fights and all those colors of this movie, it covers all those plot holes and makes people believe that it is an almost perfect movie, so it is of Men recognize that this movie cheated the world and almost fooled me. In conclusion Avengers Endgame is a very good movie lying, with a great final battle, and with many plot holes, I just want to say that I found it very difficult to put the rating on this movie, it was between 4 to 6, but then I decided that This is only a 6/10, even though deep down in my heart I know it deserves less."
1980,"Month before the release, promotion of the highly anticipated ending of the MCU Phase 1 was everywhere in every form of media promotion.
People queued in the nearby theatres as herd of sheep which were following the instructions of Disney that ""You need to watch this. If you don't, you made a sin"". I saw many sheep buying the tickets of the movie even though they didn't watch previous installments of the MCU and weren't aware of what they were going to watch.Since the epic snap of Thanos in Infinity wars, everyone was waiting for the avengers to revert that and as expected Russo brothers came up with the idea of time travel to rescue the situation. But, handling Time travel is not cup of tea of every mediocre director. They should learn from Back to the Future (Robert Zemeckis), Terminator: Judgement Day (James Cameron). Russo brothers simply ruined a lot of things like Time Travel, Thor etc. The so called epic ending was boring, over stretched.Avatar was way better than this crap. This doesn't belong to the top of highest grossing movies ever. It is outcome of just a great publicity festival ever done by Disney/marvel."
1981,"Perfect , perfect ...
the end of our heros 😢😢😢
i am crying i can not help it . Now my anothe life is ended . I stayed there with them and i am so happy for being there .😢☺"
1982,"There is more to story than action scenes. The movie was great, not as good as Infinity War but not terrible as people are making out. I understand the critisism but people rating below a 5 are clearly fan based blind."
1983,"When i left the cinema after my first inital watch, i was blown away. I had some minor gripes and flaws, but was very content with what i had seen. Probably a solid 8.5/10 at the time. Months later i have had time to dwell on the movie and craft my own opinion and well, it's very messy.
It's not bad, but the more you think about it's flaws the clearer they become.
For a start, the pacing suffers, mainly in the 2nd act. Some scenes feel pointless, unneccessary and slugish.
Another thing that i absolutely hated in this movie was multiple chatacter arcs including Black widow and Captain Marvel especially.
Black widows Character arc felt extremely rushed and forced. I wont spoil much, but i thought it was handled poorly. The character of Captain Marvel also felt extremely thrown in.
Perhaps the messiest part of the movie was the Time Travel. I wont go into detail, but it was all over the place and the characters go agains the rules of time travel multiple times.
Finally, there was a lot in the last act that did not make much sense. I again wont go into detail, but multiple scenes felt forced and Thanos' character felt off as the directors have tried to portray him in a more sinister light, which doesnt work because it completely forgets his personality in Infinity War.
Overall, this is not a bad movie and there is lots to praise which i wont go into because its been said many times over. It just has extremely noticable flaws that grow larger and larger the more you think on it.
Avengers Endgame - 6.9/10
Avengers Infinty War - 8/10"
1984,"Disappointing end to a great series where the end just left the viewer deflated and feeling meh. The 3 hour story was very drawn out, maudlin and characters lacked the personalities and substance of the previous movies. The story was also disjointed where it seemed to jump ahead of itself and lacked continuity. The was little or no action and when the big end came it was a few minutes of mediocre fighting flicking to quickly between a few characters. Has to be one of the worst Marvel movies ever and ranks up there with the worst of the Highlander sequels."
1985,"This movie was all over the place. And the writing was simply lazy.Time travel? smhIn most cases, time travel is a refuge for lazy fantasy/sci-fi writers. How do we solve this problem we got our heroes into? Time travel. LAZYAND, Captain Marvel saves Tony Stark and Blue Girl at the last minute? LAZYI won't even get into the fight scenes. Okay. Just a little. There were some clever gems. But in general, there weren't enough of them.I liken this Endgame to a Disney Star Wars Movie. That being said, Infinity War blew doors. I could watch that any day of the week."
1986,"Wow... All i can say is that the movie ended my entire childhood in the most perfect way!!
It kept you on your feet the whole way through!! Marvel somehow manages to add comedy to the most intense situations. its Awesome!! The battle scene was out of this world!! I just... wow.. Thank you marvel. I love you 3000!!!
ROBERT DOWN JUNIOR WON THE HERO OF THE YEAR AWARD THIS YEAR LAST WEEK AT THE MTV MOVIE AND TV AWARDS!!"
1987,"This film is no Masterpiece. The Russo Brothers phoned in for a relevant follow-up to Infinity War. The first two hours were incredibly dull and boring. This film was filled to the brim with Fan Service and not enough Original Story. The final hour was amazing and worth the price of admission. The movie could've been condensed and it could've gotten to the point sooner. The humor feels forced and lazy. The film was filled with jump cuts and reused camera shots from previous films. The CGI is well done. The acting is poor at points. Overall, this is an average film, with two-thirds of it falling under below average."
1988,"Being one of the best marvel movies does not means that this is one of the best movies of all time, not even the best superheroe filmSorry fanboys but is the truth"
1989,"Was this the best they could have done? Infinitely I think no. Perfection? Give me a break. It was so poorly done it should go down in history as the biggest letdown compared to its hype. A bunch of blinded fanboys are keeping its rating artificially high.Endgame is to Infinity War as Return of the Jedi is to Empire Strikes Back. We get the ending and it's fine but doesn't live up to the set up of the previous installment.Not as big of a disappointment as Indiana Jones and Kingdom of Crystal Skull, but not far behind. The time travel inconsistencies were like the aliens ruining an otherwise solid storyline.J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkein wove infinitely better stories, with better characters, better character development, and better cohesiveness."
1990,"There are some very good moments in Endgame and that's coming from a long standing MCU fan growing up with these movies. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much. Entry of Captain Marvel Was The Worst Part of the Movie , Billions of Miles Away From Earth , She Finds Tony And Nebula Brings them Back to Earth With Her Super Power , Wasted potential of Capt Marvel - why introduce a character so powerful, and then not use them for >95% of the movie? She was in the movie for like For 5 minutes.. for 3 hours movie . Also, don't get me started on how impossibly strong Thanos suddenly is without an infinity gauntlet? Even WITH the IG he couldn't stop Thor's Stormbringer, but now without the IG can easily defeat Thor with Stormbringer AND Mjollnir, Iron Man and Cap??? How convenient.These movie Will Not Convince Most of The MCU Fan's because its not done Right in 3 hours of the movie you can just enjoy 1 hour rest 2 hours are mediocre , this is most disappointing Avenger Movie. Max Rating is 6.5 /10"
1991,"Regardless to the ending in which two of the main avengers are dead and another one becomes 90 years old, the story was a complete mess with the time travel issue. Many things were not clarified good enough to the viewers and that was very confusing to the point that it ruined most of the positive experiences from watching the movie. Even for me, who saw all the marvel movies prior to this one, I have to look for online explanations in order to fill ups these holes.
In addition to that, also the action sequences were fewer than Infinity War; in fact there is just one big action sequence at the end and that's it. You don't see many action parts of individuals like you can see in Infinity War; this is a big step backwards if you ask me.
Bottom line is: Avengers Endgame has many story issues, just one impressive action sequence and it doesn't settle nothing promising for the future."
1992,"Get action sequences they are very good but too short and the same old stuff we've seen in the other movies. There is nothing epic about this movie. It is 1 hour too long, Ironman is just as annoying as always, they destroyed Thor's character and it was very boring in the first half. There is no comparison to Infinity war or the first captain America movie which had pace and great editing. Even die hard marvel fans have said end game is not what they wanted. I do appreciate this kind of movie brings customers out that don't normally venture to the cinema but this is pure marketing hype and people obviously do not watch a lot of movies to say it's amazing! Watch more decent movies folks!!"
1993,"Pandering to the politics of the day created one shot during the epic battle of ALL of the female characters that this female found trite and patronizing. 2 or more other major plot decisions are also a betrayal of the fandom by surrendering to the tyranny of identity politics.
Uneven and contradictory handling of the characters and plot decisions created a long list of plot holes and distractions .... compare Spiderman's friend and Ant Man's daughter.
There are touching and heartfelt moments ... happy and sad tears shed. Sadly, those are diminished by the distractions of the plot issues.
The 7 rating was a nod to the efforts of the players, despite the machinations of the script."
1994,Disapointing is probably too good for this film. Loads of plot holes. Easy spotted mistakes. Some characters changed or not available till the end. Did not come close to infinity war. Most would of just got caught up in all the hype. There is some good fighting in the end but not worth sitting this one out for a second time.
1995,"This was a very well made movie. They pulled off a good job trying to mash all the characters into the film, and the movie just had to have a huge epic battle in the end. Otherwise, most audiences would instantly hate the movie. They tried to give all the characters something to do like they did in Infinity War, and it worked (yet they had to get rid of Captain Marvel for most of the movie to have this structure somewhat functional, like DC did with Superman in Justice League).
They've established that their time travel is different from other movies, but it still felt inconsistent and confusing. Long story short this just allowed them to shape the story as they needed it without the need to follow basic time travel rules.
Infinity War worked because it was a basic comic book movie with a twist ending nobody expected and an untypical villain. This one was reverted to basics. I knew they were doing time travel, but I thought that they would play this around Thanos and his re-thinking of his decisions from other time parallels. This never happened, even more, his character in the past is much more cliche and uninteresting (also much more stronger than without the gauntlet).
All the drama didn't work for me either. They always put a joke here and there to lighten up the tension and just because most of the characters are basic superheroes who spill one-liners here and there. Thus, all the dramatic moments were sacrificed to stay in-line with the characters.
The epic battle was confusing and felt like the mess they did in Ready Player One, just tons of hours of CGI artists' work. It's just me, but I get bored fast of these things. This is why all the fan service of putting all the characters into the movie didn't work for me. Infinity War had them all grouped and positioned for better understanding, here it's just a mess. But they really couldn't do this otherwise anyway.
I genuinely enjoyed only three moments in this movie, Tony Stark talking to his father in 1970, Thanos seeing the memories from the parallel timeline of his success and his death (which they wasted anyway later making him even more stupid than a basic comic book villain, hence his dialogue), and Cpt. America acting up ""Heil, Hydra"" in the elevator. These were amazing.
Other than that, even fat Thor and the Hulk hating stairs didn't even break a smile on my face (as most of the out of place humor). The theater actually laughed more when Red Skull said ""Welcome, Natasha, daughter of Ivan."" I live in Ukraine and these names are very basic for us, so it just sounded like he'd say ""Welcome, Jenny, daughter of Billy"".
Anyway. I did not feel the satisfaction or the emotion I thought I would. Stark's sacrifice was justified, yet again, the drama in this movie didn't work for me. I didn't feel changed emotionally and for me this means that this movie was unable to touch me in the rights places."
1996,"Avengers: Endgame forgot that it was just a superhero, and suffered from trying to be far too ""epic"". Along the way, it lost the brisk pace and light humor that brightened up the first two movies of the series, as it tried to do too much, with too many characters, over too many needless scenes. The whole thing felt overly drawn out. 30 minutes of this film could easily have found it's way onto the cutting room floor, and the movie would have been stronger for it.In many ways, it was like the writer's of this installment lost their touch. The fat Thor joke was funny for the first 5 minutes, but they kept coming back to it again and again and again. Ya, ya, we know he got fat and lazy. Ha, ha. Now move on! But at least the overweight, drunken Thor gave us something to chuckle about, as there was very little else of a lighter, funny nature in this over-serious marathon of a movie.There was also far too much posing. A good example of this was during the huge final battle, with the fate of the world, nay the entire galaxy, hanging in the balance .... and all the female superheroes found the time to line up for a photo op! What was that all about? From across a battlefield that stretched over seemingly several square miles, all the female superheroes left whatever they were doing, in order to travel clear to where all the other female superheroes were, so that they could stand shoulder to shoulder and go ""Ok, girls, now that we're all here, lets look really serious and determined for the camera! Now, Charge!Ya, way overdone and unnecessary.As was the final funeral for .... SPOILER ALERT!! .... Ironman. I mean, come on. All that was needed was a nicely written 5 minute scene around his grave, or perhaps a memorial. What the movie didn't need was a 20 minute movie within a movie, tagged on to the end of what was already a very long film.But that was the story of this movie. Many scenes seemed overplayed and overwritten, and just a shade too long. I still enjoyed the movie, and still gave it a 7, but it could have been so much better if it had just relaxed and been more like the movies that had gotten us here. It simply tried too hard to be the greatest superhero movie of all time, and as a result, fell far short."
1997,"The movie started off really well but somewhere in the middle it just felt rushed. The already long runtime or maybe the fact that it just had too many minds working on it, the world may never know, it could've been better. Infinity war was the second best Marvel movie after Iron Man(the first one) in my opinion and Endgame although it's the end of an era it just felt it was lacking in a lot of places and that void that is left in our hearts by the departure of the Avengers might not yet be filled."
1998,"This movie forced the funny moments very bad, the end was only fan service. Just died Iron Man cause he use the gems, and Scarlett J. for sacrifice, no one slain by Thanos. Maybe was my mistake for expect a really end, but was only another marvel movie, with a happy end."
1999,"For a movie with high score review and expecting to have a higher score than the Dark Knight for the MCU lovers, it's too standard although as concept is not bad."
2000,"The movie was great but not perfect. It doesn't deserve a 10/10 in my opinion.
Few of the things I didn't like.
1. Professor Hulk was good but at the end the angry hulk should have come out to fight Thanos and Help cap. I think the huge battle at the end was too much to handle. The fight between Thanos vs. Cap, iron man and Thor was epic. Hulk should have been joining that to close the circle from first avengers.2. Captain Marvel is just too strong. Marvel made a mistake there creating her like that. It didn't make any sense in comparison to all the other superheros. Where was she until the last 5 minutes of the movie?3. Drunk fat Thor was great gimmick but at the end Thor should have gone to be himself again in the fight against Thanos. Cap isn't as strong but he hold up much longer versus Thanos. It's a bad choice for Marvel.4. Time travel has always a lot of flaws in it especially when it creates new parallels of reality. The plot lost a lot of credibility over this.Movie was good but it wasn't perfect."
2001,"After a long time, watched a movie with high expectations. They were high not coz of marketing, but this finale had all the contents to make a masterpiece.
Unfortunately one thing was missing and that was the story line. First two hours were long and boring. You can not make a movie by revisiting all old stuff again and that too in single movie.
Time travel movies ain't meant to be actions ones with superheros playing saviours.
When. You intent to make time travel stories, you should take some lessons from back to the future series.
Back to the future series have been best coz it dealt with one. Good story line.In infinity stones, for time travel events marvel never laid any stress on repercussion , also marvel. Made fun of hulks character. People would have loved to watch hulk bashing thanos to some extent.instead he was made a wuss.Same thing happened with thor in endgame. One more superhero character degraded to pathetic levels.30 min fight scenes at the end are. Moment of glory.. Still it can't be matched with infinity stones as they have much better locations in last part rather than dull battle field in this one.In nut shell, a golden moment to create a great masterpiece has gone down the drains"
2002,"It was not the best but it was like ok
the first half kind of got boring
then after the interval it gets more interesting and epic"
2003,"Overall this was a good movie. Character screen time was definitely not split as well as the last outing. Just seemed like a long build up for a poorly lit end battle. Again, a good show but not up to the standard that I have grown to expect for Marvel."
2004,"I do enjoy the ending but I am quite disappointed with Endgame's whole execution.It felt like a slap stick comedy rather than the dark Avengers movie it was supposed to be. I don't mind jokes here and there, like in Infinity War, but it was a lot of it, even til the point that I found it disturbing.Thor and Thanos was quite redeemed in IW but their portrayals here feels like a slap in the face. Are MCU even aware that Thanos was so well written that he has a fanbase?This isn't a worthy ending for Phase 3 and MCU as we know it. It was just OK."
2005,"I don't have a clue how this movie can be rated as high as 9,1.
Only a Marvel fan can give a higher rating than 6...Infinity War was much much better than Endgame.
This time travel thing is a complete mess in the Endgame. I think that Endgame was only for promoting Disney + platform and nothing else. How else can you explain so much screen time for Hawkeye?
Some thing that really bothered me were:
Strong Thanos. Thanos without any infinity stone was much stronger than in Infinity War with 5 stones.Nebula. Why didn't ""good"" Nebula warned Black Widow and Hawkeye that one of them won't come back when they will get ""red stone"" ?Steve Rogers. OMG what was with that ending? So basically Steve Rogers married Peggy, watched how Hydra took over SHIELD, his BEST friend was captured and torched for 70years but didn't do anything, because he married the lady he fell in love and knowing her like for two weeks.End of an era? What era? Chris Evans and Robert Downey Junior are done but everything else goes on.Endgame is the most overated movie ever. Period."
2006,"The story line was mostly boring, the characters (banner and Thor) were embarrassing and I missed the funny dialogues."
2007,"Absolutely littered with plot holes, this the last Jedi of this franchise. Don't let the nostalgic factor blind you from the poor writing."
2008,"Endgame wraps up the decade of MCU nicely. A little too nicely. Too many loose ends tied up without any explanation, while tracking through all the movies so far. All the characters from 21 films showed up, even some cameos. Hell, even Natalie Portman showed up! But was that necessary??But the problem in the end was the amount of time spent wallowing in sorrow, which meant that all that brilliant cast of heroes were short-changed, when the time came for them to step up. Doctor Strange brought everyone back and then barely did anything, Black Panther ran for 5 seconds, Shuri was right of frame for all of 5 seconds, Winter Soldier took a couple of shots, I could go on...The emotional moments were not emotional enough, especially Tony's death. Spidey's fade in Infinity War was heart-breaking, Tony's death barely registered. Natasha sobbed for a few frames and then sacrificed herself, quickly forgotten 30 seconds later. I would have been fine with Cap dying in the battle against Thanos, because his life was suddenly made selfish at the end. Which is completely ridiculous, after building that legacy all through these movies.In the end, had it not been for Cap, I would have scored this movie a 5. Him picking up Mjolnir was just pure gold"
2009,"First of all,the movie is not the the best movie ever unlike some of the reviews telling here,they are marvel shills,don't listen to them, it is not even the best MCU movie.There are a lot of flaws.First thing to discuss the plot,that is stupid,because if Thanos of 2014 comes in 2023 ,then that Thanos never comes in 2018,because he gets killed,infinity war never happens,so how is this movie even possible.The second thing and that might be a bit personal but the movie was advertised as the conclusions of the arcs of the original avengers,they nailed the Arc of iron man,but falcon is not Steve Rogers,there is just one captain America and he can never be replaced.They did it to team him up with Bucky because there is a series coming out on Disney+.and then thor leaves his throne and gives it to the most idiotic person in Asgard, Valkyrie.She is a drunkard,she doesn't shows any attributes of a ruler.Worst decision ever.And u know the reason they did this to pair him up with guardians,so they set up a gotg sequel,they set up a web series and they forced captain Marvel down the audience throats.She just arrived a month ago and is the most egoistic person of the entire MCU.her each line of dialogue is filled with ego and cringe but the action scenes are dope.And why does Hawkeye sacrifices Natasha,Bruce should do it because she is the most loved person in banner's life,not of hawkeye.the best one is when captain America lifts Mjolnir,the theatre was filled with roars for a couple of minutes.Overall just a good movie with enough flaws that sinks it in front of its much better prequel."
2010,"I'm a big avengers fan, but this movie... This culmination of all Avengers movies was ridiculous! First of all there is a big mismatch how the world turned out to be after 50% of all species disappeared.Then the whole movie tries to build up this emotional atmosphere about how sad it is for everyone and they spent freaking 3 hours doing this! Game of Thrones kind of does the same, but ten times more effectively. The action scenes are nice, but a kind of a celebration of the characters instead of story line fighting.My review in short. This move is about 90min too long. Cut the slow building emotions scenes, because they are done wrong and only makes you bored. If you wanna know how to do such scenes right look to GoT."
2011,"I remember ten years ago when I was a comic book fan and the whispers that were coming out about a Thanos Avengers movie blew my mind. Infinity War satisfied that desire greatly, but Endgame is a mixed bag. I came out of the cinema feeling rather underwhelmed.To be sure, the action is superb. The last half hour of action made me grin from ear to ear and it gave me a similar feeling to watching Return of the King for the first time. However, it was a long road to get to that point.The film is too long. Far too long. It carries far too much baggage from the last movie and drags its heels, which in turn creates a jarring tonal discordance from quipping-Marvel fun to apocalyptic moping. Stop telling me how important things are. I know. Show me why they're important.Another problem I have is the story. It never felt like I was watching one. Infinity War was a hectic race against the clock, Endgame felt like I was watching a board meeting of writers and executives discussing how they're going to tie up loose ends. This is a movie that serves a cinematic universe owned by Disney, rather than serving to tell us a story.Without discussing spoilers, the plot is far too convoluted. The all-powerful Infinity Gems created enough plotholes you have to ignore, but adding time travel to the mix compounds this even further. It would be fine if the movie just dismissed these plotholes, but it keeps harping on the precise mechanics of how the time travel works in the MCU over and over, forcing me to think about how it makes no sense over and over. I don't like thinking about plotholes but Endgame just kept reminding me of them. Combined with the length this makes a large amount of the movie rather a chore to sit through.You must think I hate this movie after that, but I don't. The positives are the ones that come with the standard Marvel movie, funny writing, excellent music, effects, acting and likable characters. I'm certainly glad to have seen it, but unlike Infinity War, it wears out it's welcome after the first viewing."
2012,"What a waste of a film. The first hour was totallly wasted. Yes there were good bits in it, but a stupid story with a boring script couldn't save this."
2013,"What it needs to be a hero? Power? No. Sacrifice? Yes. It's not the end. There will always be a fight worth fighting for. There will always be a dream to avenge. Never ever give up. Do whatever it takes. And be a hero. Thank you MCU for giving us 10 years of lovely memories. To teach us about love, friendship and determination. It was a wonderful experience, thank you again."
2014,"""After the years of a big buildup what a big let down . There was plot hole after plot hole and little action scenes. Thanos was like a little girl in comparison to infinity war . Captain Marvel one of the most powerful in the galaxy was on annual leave only there for little bits . The Hulk was a disappointment. Thoese rating a high score are just not watching the movie at all .""I have to agree with this statement, plot holes all over the movie.. but in the other hand if you like a visual appealing movie and you are a Tony Stark/Iron Man fan well i guess its not a completly waste.In other words, I wouldnt pay to see it again."
2015,"I was so, so excited for this. After incredible films like Thor Ragnarok, Captain Marvel and Avengers: Infinity War I thought it would be a sensational ending worth waiting for.It was not.This film could have been 20 minutes long and would have been good, but instead it's stretched out for 3 hours. I have to admit that at many points I found myself thinking 'just get ON with it'There are so many scenes that are so pointless and so drawn out and nowhere near enough action.It's all about that last fight scene, where everyone comes back and Thanos is defeated.
But it's poorly choreographed, badly executed and there's no clear structure to what's going on, there's no bigger picture and the whole thing (although it's my favourite part of the film) just seems badly done.As a woman I'm all up for a bit of girl power, but the bit with all the female characters coming together for a whole 8 seconds then it just focusing on something else was really annoying, it's like they're just trying to tick all the boxes and keep the feminists happy. Just awfulAnd why is Pepper suddenly an Avenger? Hasn't she got a 5 year old to look after?I think I hated it. Which is a shameI don't understand why it has so many good reviews"
2016,"It has taken many years and lots of work to build up to this amazing movie. This completely satisfied and exceeded my expectations for how I hoped they would pull this all off. I have been a huge fan of the movies leading up to this and this did it all justice. All the hidden ""Easter eggs"" from the other installments have been hinting towards this and I can't believe how big this has all gotten over the years. I was glad to see that even though this movie had a very serious fight at hand that there was still some classic Marvel comedy that made for some very funny moments. There was laughter, tears, and cheers through this movie. It was an emotional roller coaster that I already plan on going to again soon in theaters. It is a must see for those who have already been fans of the MCU and if you haven't followed it to this point this movie won't make sense or mean much to you so go back and watch the other movies. It is all worth it."
2017,"This movie does everything right. I was so pleased and satisfied walking out of the theater, it's really hard to understate it. The Russo Brothers absolutely lived up to the expectations and delivered the epic conclusion we were all waiting for. You can probably nitpick this movie if you want (as you can any movie), but to me that's pretty much what you have to do to find flaw with it. I think that the emotions throughout are played so well and we get those moments with each character where they feel human, especially with all 6 of our original avengers. Each has their moment to shine and I truly loved it. The humor was well-used, the story made sense, the finale was downright perfect, and it was an all-around great movie!SPOILERS
My favorite stuff
The beginning with Clint's family was downright heartbreaking to watch, and a great way to bring that human aspect to the story, seeing someone who had no idea what was going on be affected by the snapThe subversion of expectation meeting thanos and realizing he not only doesn't have the stones but he doesn't carePaul Rudd. What a guy.The second act plot is really done well, it makes sense yet the way they go about it with the callbacks to almost every movie through cameos or reliving scenes is great, especially in the New York scenes (specifically the elevator scene from winter soldier being called back)-Black Widow dying is another expectation subversion and is done very well
Tony having a moment with his dad is great to seeThe way by which thanos is reintroduced as the villain is actually brilliant and gives a new perspective to his motivations and the way he destroys the facility after the reversal snap is greatCap picking up Thor's hammer is all kinds of yupGiving our main three some alone time fighting thanos is a great way to give them their time to shineAvengers Assemble is everything I didn't know I needed.Tony's arc is done so well and how he sacrificed himself reminds me so deeply of the scene in Avengers when cap said tony wouldn't sacrifice himself for others.Cap getting to dance with PeggyThor joins the Guardians!My negative stuff (these didn't really bother me that much but a little bit)
The whole fat Thor thing kinda makes some of the dramatic moments later on kinda weaker in my opinionSame with half-hulk, almost felt hard to take him seriously at first but it made more sense as the story grewNot sure I can buy thanos changing his mind for his plan to cleanse the universe by destroying it and starting over, but I like that he's willing to die for his own causewould've liked more action especially in the first act but I appreciated the emotions"
2018,"After Infinity War I knew it would be hard to top. And I was certainly correct. This movie has little to no action, and relies heavily on a 'blast from the past' mentality. In a movie where half the population has been wiped out, everyone seems to be pretty happy about and make jokes about it all the time."
2019,"I just went to see the Avengers Endgame on Apr 25th, in Hawaii.First, I have to say......it was a good solid movie. However, it did not touch me or speak to me. I was not moved at all. The Infinity Wars, was far more emotional and gut wrenching, this one was just an attempt to change things up, do the unexpected, and try desperately to wrench our emotions.I will simply say that in this movie I was never mad, hurt, sad, or excited. No emotions this time.Some of the battles were epic, and some were hyped up and fizzled out quickly, and some battles just never happened. Some disappointing moments.Finally, when the battle was reaching a climax, and the home team got a chance to exact some revenge, things felt petty and predictable. Honestly, might have been better to follow the comic arc and stay true. Honestly, for the life of me, I do not know why I was not choked up in certain scenes when I should have been. Seems they were trying to hard to touch our hearts, and it felt disconnected.Three hours later......and had to wake my wife up several times which is usually a sign. She was wide awake in Infinity Wars, beginning to end.So if you just looking for revenge or a reckoning, congratulations.....you got it. But if you are looking for real emotional struggles and happy reunions......mehhhhhh......they tried....some were decent.I will not give any spoilers, but I will say I am flat out angry because my favorite character of all time, since I was a child, did not fight! Seriously, WTF?! And after what happened in Infinity Wars, it makes no sense."
2020,"Find superhero. Superhero doesn't want to get involved. Talk to superhero until they do want to get involved. Repeat. Endgame has its moments, but it's way too bloated for its own good."
2021,"This movie is everything that fans and viewers wanted it to be. It clearly shows that the makers have put their heart and soul into the movie instead of just making money out of the popularity.It is 3 hours long but never felt like it. The sequence of emotions in the movie is sad, cheer, laugh, cry and repeat.Watch it before it gets spoiled for you!!!"
2022,"The movie most disappointed.
Boring but exciting in other moments. I've expecting receive an epic and amazing ending after 22 movies. But. I just received and screenplay with black hole that eat the logic and congruence. I'm disappointed. Furious.I want to see a marvelous movie. But, why? Why marvel? You made a movie full of no logic just completely made for fan service. Is just a mixture of back to the future, and other moves referenced in.Was good. Not epic.
Was bad. Not terrible.Unfunny. The jokes don't made me laugh. But see all superheroes in screen was emotional and right. Some minutes were boring and useless. Some characters were wasted."
2023,"I'm A HUGE fan of the MCU but I'm not sure if the movie was bad or my expectations were too high. I found myself tapping my fingers and looking around the theater to find that others were bored as well.Honestly, the third act was more like previous MCU movies but it dragged getting there. This could have been a much shorter movie while maintaining the story and keeping fans from getting bored."
2024,"Some people said there's so few fights scenes and it's boring. But if you watch MCU whole, you know what is this all aboutMovie is just iconic. I remember how strong my heart was beating in the final battle. Everyone who worked on this movie did best they can. I gave only 4-5 movies 10 stars , and Endgame absolutely deserves it."
2025,Everything I wanted to see and what I never could dream that would be possible. I expected something great and it was an epic movie
2026,"A great Visual spectacle about everything you want with avenger End game..
RDJ again proves why he is best with.I am Iron Man
Chris Evans nails with Hammer ⚡ and Sheild
The Rest of Avengers Team is Great.
The Directors Jor and Anthony Russo done Fantastic job and rest of Teams.. Overall its must watch for Avenger Fan"
2027,"Just a ridiculous movie with an ordinary plot.Watched it for an hour then got out of cinemaNo doubt people have been brainwashed by the Avengers franchise.Its just so silly really.Special effects were OK.Don't waste your time, 3 hours"
2028,Really overrated. Was funny at points however. I don't think I would even bother to watching it again. I do genuinely love the other marvel films but this one was soul draining and just a disappointing on the whole.
2029,"The movie is good, but me and my teenage daughter and her friends saw it tonight and all were a bit disappointed. We all feel Infinity War was much better and I personally felt the first hour dragged out too slow and long. Don't get all the 10/10 scores."
2030,"It was ok, but not living up to all the hype. The fiirst movie was much better in my humble opinion."
2031,"Now don't get me wrong it was a good film but that's all it was and in my opinion inferior to infinity war. I thought the first 30 mins were great and really thought I was in for a treat of a film but then it sort of plateaued out for a couple hours. I think the time traveling idea was a good one and probably the only option they had for that story line in restoring the worlds population but I think it could have been done a little different perhaps with a little more action. The last 30 mins was a great battle and fairly similar to infinity war and I think it was right to kill off iron man and pretty much kill off captain America (although captain America going back to put the stones back has me questioning more of the time jump)The areas of the film that I really didn't enjoy were the treatment of 2 characters, thor.....fat and a slob!? I understand he felt responsible but his character was turned into a bit of a joke which was awful. Likewise the hulk, not really a man and not really the hulk but somewhere in between.....again I understand he found peace to live with the hulk but it was not done very well in my opinion.Going back to thor he was very close to defeating thanos in infinity war when thanos had stones, yet in end game thanos had no stones and Thor couldn't get close to him!Maybe I need to watch it a second time and like I said it was just a good film with a lot of holes and I couldn't help feel disappointed after the hype and build up."
2032,"This movie is any thing but best of Avengers series.
Its slow and boring , only the last 30 min of war was good, scenes of iron man and Thanos era was well picturised everything else one can skip.
Time travel is not so easy to explain and its said in the movie itself you cant kill ny one in time travel, then how one character dies , dont want to give spoiler but after that scene I realise this script was not enough research, director should have thought of something but time travel as mean to fight back.
Any ways its well picturised , three main characters are gone so I think now you wont get to see them ny more
Dont expect too much from this movie Infinity war was better"
2033,"Think I've watched a different film to most reviewers!
It's too jokey too cheesy and too long, infinity war was brilliant this is well below that level."
2034,"I've been waiting for this moment for 11 years I grew up with marvel as I could not stand tony's death first because I cried because it was our first eye pain that we filmed the first half-hour in the first half an hour or something, moving forward after a ride was a construction of the eternity stones sent us into ancient times We understood the importance of time and it was nice to see the ancient one again, and the room was aware of everything, they took the stones stark made their own glove and the hulk snapped her finger and everyone came back now, you know where the enemies are! such a battle is not the greatest battle in the history of the film captain america is also taking an attractive abooo. :) then ours is taking tony dying captain goes to the past and goes on with margaret carter and then comes to the old state falcona is giving the shield to the new captain america she is leaving thor asgard kingdom to valkrie and joining guardians of the galaxy he ends."
2035,"To put it simply: One of THE most overrated films ever made....
I wanted it to be everything i'd hoped for, i wanted it to live up to the gargantuan hype, but unfortunately it falls short and in essence 'fails nonetheless' (to quote Thanos)
The final fight was good, but again nothing more
I do not wish to include spoilers so i'll say this:
This was not EPIC
Some people thought so
But not us
#DontspoiltheEndgame"
2036,"Endgame has some really fun and epic moments. It also has some very emotional moments. But this movie is far from a ""love letter"" to fans of the OG6 Avengers, as some critics have claimed. Far from it. Endgame basically steamrolls over 10 years of character development for most of the OG6, especially Tony, Steve, and Thor. I was extremely disappointed with how these characters were treated, because they deserved so much better than Endgame. Instead of resolving their character arcs in a satisfying and sensical way, the Russos decided to go for meaningless shock value and ""fanservice"" that only makes sense to them (and not the majority of fandom). This is like Age of Ultron all over again, except much more depressing and upsetting. A shameful end to a wonderful saga."
2037,"It's a fine action movie for one time, jokes are good too. However, it lacks something that Infinity War had. As anyone else I've been waiting for the greatest hit the entire year. It's sad to admit but I left the theater with a feeling of disatisfaction."
2038,I'm a lifelong Marvel nerd. I live and breathe Marvel; with that said I'll start my review. The story picks up immediately after Infinity War with Thanos decimating 50% of all life as they try and rectify it. The cast was good though I honestly felt it lacking in conviction besides Tony Stark. The action was lackluster as heck. Endgame is 30 minutes longer then Infinity War and had maybe a fourth of the action runtime that its predecessor had prior. Disappointing battles minus one which lasted all of but a few minutes. The comedy was Endgames only saving salvation to be honest. It pains me to write this because Infinity War was the best superhero movie since sliced bread for a culmination movie. Average at best for me. They should have stopped after Infinity War though I know the comics wouldn't have it. I personally thought it was a cash grab. I'd say watch it once absolutely but don't believe the hype. Endgame makes Age of Ultron look good AF.
2039,"Warning: This movie will exceed your expectation!!!Marvel has quite mastered the art of story-telling!The trailer has been teasing us with pretty much nothing and what a way to promote Endgame.In the rarity of today's world, where most trailers almost tell you everything in 3 minutes.This review is about to reveal nothing just like the trailer did other than what an epic conclusion!!Tears 7/10
Intrigue 9/10
Mystery 8.5/10
Ending 9.5/10p.s. There is no post end credit scene. Save yourself 10 minutes of time."
2040,The words can never describe how awesome the movie was. I brought my own diaper to last the 3 hour movie.
2041,I was so suprised when i saw the first infinity film. Everything made sense and Worked together. But when i saw this movie some parts just didn't fit. The overall humor didn't do the movie any good. The Thor is fat and the Hulk is both strong and smart joke got old really fast. I fellt like the movie wasn't insink with the first one.The ending was satisfying but didn't make up for the rest.The first acts of the movie really were promissing but they lost it somewhere in the middel. This one is a 7 and the first one a 9.My overal problem is that this movie misses the pace the first one had.So go watch the movie and see it yourself.
2042,"Some really good hype moments here and there but the movie plays out like expected. It's sadly very far from Infinity War quality, 7/10."
2043,"Disney.. my god i waited for this movie so many years and yeah this movie sucked IF i am gonna be honest. Feminist propaganda ofc and they maked hulk and Thor the strongest avengers the most weak avengers.😂
It had some good parts but infinity war was so more epic and better
I hate Disney becuse they ruin movies"
2044,I laughed so loud I clapped with so much force and I cried so hard the movie exceeds every expectation and is the perfect culmination of the entire marvel cinematic universeAvoid spoilers as all costs !
2045,"First I would like to remark that it is my very own personal opinion and I don't want to scare anybody from watching this movie. Every MCU fan should watch this film, but as I, a comic fan as well, won't enjoy it as much as one expects it, in my opinion.
I grew up on these films and the crown of those films was unfortunately built merely on the last films for example Captain Marvel.
I don't want to speak about what would be better I better just say what I liked and what I did not.
I liked that the final battle was very comicish, and that this film explained a bunch of previous mysteries for instance how the Hydra got the scepter.
I disliked that the jokes were too childish for me and that the time travel was too sloppy.
I found a bit disrespectful what they did to Thor the god of thunder and I still don't understand why they boosted Captain America to be able to hold the Mjölnir and summon lightnings.
All in all I am a bit disappointed, I feel it is not worth my awaitings and I am a bit concerned what the future of our beloved characters will be."
2046,Was it good? Of course it was.... Was it the best one in the series? Not even close... I was so excited for this movie and I left disappointed.
2047,"As others said, the time travel part just stinks. I still enjoyed it, I laughed on the jokes, there were moments where I nearly cried, and others that made me clap with all along the audience. But overall the who whole story is quite an illogical mess. There's the saying ""they bit more than they can chew"". This is exactly what happened, they tried to fill all their previous movies into one and it could actually work, if they just fixed the time travel part. But they didn't, and I left the theatre with full of unanswered questions. Too bad, because there were so many good ideas, emotions, and great acting."
2048,I don't know. I don't like it much. I think because after infinity war i expected much more from marvel! And i liked infinity war very very much.
2049,"I don't know if we ever could of imagined the state of Marvel comic-book movies 11 years after the first MCU film in 2008, to review this film as a movie a one of film, I don't think that would do it justice because as a single stand alone film (even though its a sequel) would not do it the proper justice , however this is the only way I know how to break down a film. I will judge the MCU as a whole in another review. If I was to sum this movie up as brief as possible its, Avengers end game is the fan service movie you didn't know you wanted, with a story and battles thrown in there to pad the run time.
Where the movie succeeds is in its grandeur and its design, it is extremely large scale, sometimes to its own detriment ( I looking at you final battle sequence ) but nevertheless you can feel the immensity of this epic, I will be breaking it down into several parts, Story, Cinematography, Actors/Actress , Characters, Motivations, Soundtrack, Pacing, Design, Re-watch ability & HeartStory
when you have a story that expands over 20 plus movies to culminate into one it is a hard task, but this movie does succeed in the story it has clear goals, which they seem to accomplish, sometimes without any resistance what so ever, the scene where Tony stark, just happens to make time travel possible after stating it could never be done, was a little jarring & every obstacle that they did eventually encounter was immediately remedied, antmans a baby then turn the power off , couldn't get the correct stone, just go back again, there seemed to be obstacles placed in there way in order for the heroes to just step over them, rather then a climb or hurdle, personally I feel it would have been better to have as many if they were not as significant, the part I loved was in the first act where we see a 5 year jump and the world is still in mourning over the vanishing of half the population, the arc in which Hawk eye is introduced again was a satisfying one, the lead up to the inevitable gathering of all the heroes from earth and beyond was something expected in the final act but was done in a way that would even simmer the harshest of critics, the killing of Thanos in the first 10 minutes was a pleasant surprise, but without a clear antagonist until about 1 hour and 45 minute mark, the story progression took a back seat for character development, Storyline Score 7.5/10Cinematography
Thankfully unlike a lot of the other MCU this film sense of Enormity was done quite well with the cinematography, while the standardised shot, reverse shots were very predominant, there are a few glorious moments, mainly involving the quantum realm & the final battle sequence, the colour scenes and lighting are an improvement on Infinity war up until the final battle, but the cold colour pallet sets the mood for a very different MCU film in the beginning , Cinematography Score 6/10Actors/Actress
To me this is where the movie shines its brightest as there is a range we see from many actors, the desperation in the beginning on Chris Hemsworth's face & the slight lip quiver and slightly tearing eyes of Scar-Jo allowed us to see this is a passionate cast we are dealing with, the subtleties of almost every actor in this film reflect the minor changes they have from shot to shot, with a show don't tell style which is refreshing for the MCU. Stand-outs are RDJ, Chris Evens & Scarlet Johansen
Actor/actress score 8.5/10Characters
Every character in this film felt like they had a role to play, and there wasn't too much cross over between them, rocket raccoon was the snippy one, ant-man was the comic relief however Thor was a problem to say the least, the running gag of him being a fat hair drunk was played up way to much and in almost every scene he was in we are constantly reminded that he is drunk and fat and hairy, he was the anti Thor to every other Thor portrayals & it wasn't because of what he went through it was because of how he was written. The characters develop properly in this and while there isn't many major arcs in the film involving characters the one of Tony stark from, being afraid to do anything because of the fear of losing his daughter or his daughter losing him transcending into the hero that defeated Thanos and died in the process, was not only touching but poetic, the sounds of sobbing where heard in the theatres and it was a (forgive the pun) stark reminder of what the characters mean to people here in the real world. Character score 7/10Motivations
Every movie has the characters that motivations make no sense - this film is no different , however as of writing this, I cannot find a world breaking character motivation that took me away from the film, they all had goals and did what they needed to do to achieve those goals. With one of the exception, when evil nebula comes back from the past, everyone seems to forget about her while sorting out the infinity stones, which felt like a plot device to allow her to bring Thanos to the future.
Motivations 9/10Soundtrack
The best part of the score was the nostalgic soundtracks when different characters were introduced and combined with the current score, the music in this film is generic and nothing to write home to, there is a distinct lack of strong motivating soundtrack to pump you up nor one to bring you down when needed, for me this was one of the most disjointing parts of the film .Soundtrack score 3/10Pacing
The film has a pacing issue, go figure a 3 hour movie with a pacing issue, there are scenes and segments where it is clear, this section is for laughing, this section is for going wow, this is the sad section and felt extremely stretched, the first 1 hour and a half was the hardest part to get through pacing wise, when we are so used to a full film being over by this stage, I feel there is many parts of this film that could be cut out to make it more streamline without compromising the final product.
The final act approx 1 hour 10 minutes of the film goes extremely fast while the first 2 acts seem to almost double in length when watching it. Pacing score 5/10Design
There is not much to say about the design of the world they create, everything is as it should be, the time machine looked great and believable, Thanos ships & warriors, every planet (most of which we have seen before) were done almost flawlessly - the only concern I had was the look of Thanos when moved and fought, seemed extremely ridged and choppy, not sure if that is to do with where I watched it on, but it was jarring. Design score 8.5 out of 10Re-watch ability
This is where this part of the review gets tricky, there are parts that are extremely fun and enjoyable to watch over and over again, give me the first 15 minutes and the last hour, but to go through the choppy paced part of the film when you already know what is happening, is a task, a movie like this which has many ups and downs within it, its a journey and one I will not be partaking a 3rd time any time soon. It does take a lot out of you physically and emotionally & reliving those emotional moments tends to make them less of an impact & with those moment this films climax would not stand up. Re-watch ability score 6/10Heart
This movie does have heart, it is the one key factor that I find in more of the grittier comicbook film I tend to enjoy more, there is a joyfulness that is thrown in there in times of stress , undercutting the tension of the film, this is what I call marvel-ing for everything serious you have you must immediately undercut it with something else, normally this is one of my biggest pet peeves about marvel films as of late but for what ever within the confines of this film I felt them more necessary then ever, the characters interaction with each other and the care you can see is not just an act make this movie much more than I expected. Heart score 9/10
Adding the totals I give the film a review of 70.5% Making it the 5th highest aggregate score
That being Said, I did thoroughly enjoy the film and do recommend it."
2050,"It wouldve been easily the most epic comic book movie ever. (It still is for many parts)Not gonna go into huge spoilers for this one, just gonna say that the story was brilliant. It was SO well executed.What really annoyed me about this movie were 3 things:
1) Thor being a complete laugh
2) Fortnite (seriously Marvel? thats just sad)
3) Cap being able to wield Thors hammer all of a sudden for no reason at all. (Time travel makes it reconsider whos worthy it seems?)oh and 4 - 14000000) Fortnitehave a good one"
2051,"* Why buildup Thor only to tear him to shreds in Endgame? You literally destroyed his brand.
* How was Captain Marvel able to locate the ship Tony Stark was on at the beginning of the film?
* Why use ""Quantum Realm"" when the majority of the audience will get confused and lost in it?
* Why did Captain Marvel say she was going to fight Thanos solo when she, Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man couldn't even take him down without a use of a gauntlet? Is she really that arrogant?
* Why was Thanos awesome in the first movie, but became a generic villain in Endgame?
* Why did the writers do an awesome job on the infinity war, but fall hard in Endgame? Did someone just tell them, ""let's put all the jokes and scenes you guys want and hopefully it makes sense."" Because that's exactly what it felt like.
* Why doesn't doing anything in the past affect the future? It felt so cringeworthy seeing interactions in previous movies that weren't meant to happen.
* Why has Thor become Batman of the DC universe? Do directors and producers LOVE destroying characters that we love? Seems like it.
* Thor's mother didn't need to be ""trained by witches"" to know that her son Thor was different from her son she saw only moments earlier. So why even bring that up?
* Did everyone who ""died"" in infinity war go to a special spirit world of wakanda and just remain there till 5 years later according to spider-man?
* Why couldn't have anyone simply put on the gauntlet and wiped out Thanoses army? And why didn't Thanos destroy everybody who was a threat to him in infinity war?
* Why did a rat start Endgame by returning ant-man? That seems awfully convenient doesn't it?
* How can Captain America pick up Thor's hammer and even use lightning when he couldn't pick it up in the first avengers movie?
* Where was Captain Marvel most of the movie? Was she vacationing?
* Why was the first hour so slow, The second hour and a half talking about quantum physics that no one understands, and the last 30 minutes of the film fighting when anyone could have simply worn the glove and wiped out thanoses army?
* How did Scarlett Witch seemingly become more powerful than even Captain Marvel?
* Why didn't anyone save Black Widow when everything else can be done with convenience? Did no one just not want to save her because there was no purpose and it just gave them rage to fight?There's a hundred more questions I want to ask, but these are just some of the main ones."
2052,"Amended after re-watching:
First the good:
1. Big fight scene was epic and was great to see everyone on screen at the same time . Amazing stuff.
2. Favorite part - Cap handles Thor's hammer. Just outstanding and emotional.
Ok, now the not so good:
1. Captain Marvel. Why they make the biggest and baddest superhero someone we haven't grown to love over the previous decade is baffling. And beyond that, Brie Larson is just unlikeable. But seriously, if she could take Thanos on head to head by herself and blow up his ship in seconds, why not let her wear the gauntlet? Lastly, going out of their way to let you know she's a lesbian was a bit much. You don't need a short haircut and ugly clothes just because you're gay. Plenty of attractive lesbians out there, but whatever. Brie butchers the role regardless.
2. Professor Hulk - did anyone like this adaptation? We've grown to love seeing Hulk smash and in both this and Infinity Wars, not one single fight scene with him smashing. Just sad.
3. Fat Thor - ok, fine, Chris Hemsworth can pull off the comedy really well, and I enjoy it when he does, but the whole movie we get the Big Lebowski? I would have much rather seen him back in shape magically from reconnecting with Mjolnir. In the end, he was still extremely awesome, so that was fine, but I just don't see the point of making him fat for the whole movie.
4. Time travel - is anyone besides me sick of every Sci-fi show using time travel to fix everything? If you're going to do it, at least take full advantage. We had the opportunity to see one on one fights with Thanos' Black Squad. How about Hulk going primal against the big guy (and even hurting Thanos some). Dr, Strange rematch with Ebony Maw, etc., etc. on the end, I think they could have cut some of the boring first hour and given us more action fight scenes that we've come to know Marvel for.In closing, the movie was still really good. I guess my expectations were just so high as they were closing out the phase that the changes with Hulk, Thor, and introduction of Captain Marvel just seemed misplaced and took away a lot of what I had come to love about the franchise. Still better than anything DC has managed to throw together."
2053,"AVENGERS END GAME .. it's more than overrated.1-As a result I have lost faith in all Rotten tomatoes , metacritic etc . All movie reviews by magazines,newspaper,media...were compromised. All of them were PAID for excellent reviews . Seems majority of the budget was allocated to buy out of world reviews .2-Honestly speaking , 2009 movie Avatar looked more promising for a budget of $250 million while Endgame seems of $100 million.3- Now coming towards the story line .. if summed in one word...The Storyline & screenplay is Average & Some portions of the movie are totally Disgusting .. Pathetic . A comedy show admist grief sticken superheroes with leading Joker Thor. Only Captain America's presence is worthy in the movie .4) Plot Holes like Nebula killed her past self but was still alive .. Captain's shield was destroyed by Thanos but in the last it was being given to falcon to carry on the legacy...
LOL !!Endgame was actually a big hole itself where plot was visible like island . Whole time travel charisma was done deliberately to appeal children.5- Emotions were inserted .. induced . Except for Natasha's sacrifice .. nothing was emotional.6-Whole movie was like moving along a highway with speed breaker every 100 metres. Just the momentum starts to build .. there come brakes .7- Avengers-1 2012 was best superhero action movie but Endgame is CRAP .. three hour headache where many had witnessed people who watches regular Movies are totally been disappointed. A Majority of the crowd felt CHEATED except the today's kids & die hard & stubborn Marvel fans.8 - It could have easily gone past 4 billion dollars if the movie was at par with infinity war coz Endgame was a movie which every cinema lover wanted to be a part of as a Great Saga was coming to an end .9 - Endgame doesn't seems to be the work of Russo brother at all . Just compare with their past movies . It looks more like Frankstein kind of work ."
2054,"I enjoyed this as a popcorn movie, but parts of it made no logical sense to me. For example, if Nebula only had one Pim's capsule, how on earth did Thanos AND Gamora AND past Nebula travel to the future? Also, if people are traveling forward on their own timeline (as they suggested) then how can they travel forward to a timeline where they are already dead? Makes no sense."
2055,It was inevitable that Infinity War set up too big a plotline for it to not be somewhat disappointing in the conclusion. Very sentimental (too sentimental?). These will not be popular opinions. Oh well.
2056,"Hawkeye loses his family with the snap. Tony Stark and Nebula are stranded in space. They are rescued by Captain Marvel. What remains of the Avengers set off to confront Thanos only to find that he had already destroyed the Stones. Five years later, Scott Lang escapes from the quantum realm. He is shocked by the new world order and comes up with an idea to save everyone, a Time Heist.This is the 22nd film in the MCU. The best aspect is that it pulls together the whole series of movies and fulfill many of their emotional storylines. Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Ant-Man, and Nebula all get some powerful personal stories. Thor is doing a funny ""The Dude"" Lebowski. Iron Man is his family. Captain America finally gets his love. Hawkeye becomes vengeance. There are some other aspects that I would alter with the Infinity Gauntlet.For Ant-Man, Paul Rudd's comedic takes diminishes his pain from losing Hope. He's not quite as broken as Hawkeye. His lost keeps conflicting with his humor. Black Widow's fight with Hawkeye lasts too long. Sometimes, less is more and doing fewer reversals would add power to each turn. Nebula's final confrontation with herself needs some better work. She needs to have a talk with herself or do an Indiana Jones and shot right away. She could give a punchline like ""I don't like how she looks"". The movie yadayada a lot about time travel. The only explanation is that it's not any of those movies. It's a funny line but it's basically saying that it has no rules. Then the characters say that there are rules. I don't begrudge the MCU for yadayadaing the rules because that could get real complicate. Finally, this MCU ends like many MCU movies, with a chaotic massive final battle. I'd prefer cutting that back and the female Avengers assemble is a little too convenient. Just have two other women. That's enough. It becomes fan service. Overall, the emotional resolutions are great. The recalls to the other movies are satisfying. The story works for the most part. In a franchise that is sure to keep going to infinity, this is a great rest stop to say a few goodbyes."
2057,"I had very high expectations for this one because Avengers: Infinity War was indeed a very good movie.Things I didn't like:1) Fat Thor: Thor is my favourite Marvel / Avengers character and I didn't like seeing him being ridiculed like that2,3,4) Iron Man and Nat dying, Captain America ageing: I just didn't like these outcomesOverall I would have preferred an ending where they beat Thanos and just all stay alive and well."
2058,"It was an ok movie. I liked it, but I felt it could've been a lot better.For the first half of the movie, things were going along well. It was paced a bit too slowly, as I felt like it could've worked better if it were faster, but it still worked. Some of the comedy was alright, but some things I found unnecessary was the stuff about Hulk dabbing and Thor playing Fortnite.... and him... being fat. Yeah, that honestly was way too cringey.The second half was disappointing, to say the least. Thanos' character was... well... let's just say he was meh and so two-dimensional in comparison to his Infinity War counterpart. And then there was the final clash. That was definitely A LETDOWN. It just felt too rushed, too shallow and bland (almost as bland as all the character's reactions in front of Iron Man's funeral). And there were only a few of the characters in that battle, especially the revived ones who died in Infinity War that actually got a decent amount of screentime and even enough lines (Drax, Mantis, Doctor Strange even, I mean, seriously, they barely said anything).The ending was... ehh. Although it is justifiable for Captain America to spend all that time with Peggy (Thanos has just been defeated, what else could he do now other than fulfilling his long-held desires?), what's weird is that he showed up on the bench as an old man rather than traveling back with his suit, implying that he had lived through one timeline leading up to his future arrival (which literally makes no sense, considering the time-travel rules the movie made for itself).I definitely thought this movie could've played out so much better, but then the script just hits us with plot holes and many unanswered questions (such as what happened to Loki and the tesseract too?) It could've been so much more, but hey. That's just me. I guess all that hype from Infinity War made me disappointed."
2059,This time I m speech less best movie of the year and so emotional comedy and some out of action this is snap of fingers
2060,"I think the movie had been better if the Hulk had more fighting scenes in it other than his acting like a multiple PhD holder. And did they really have to create an obese Thor? I didn't really see the purpose for this transformation, if I could call it that. I just felt like the movie could have been better it they included more scenes with the ""resurrected"" heroes leading up to the last battle scene..."
2061,"First 2 hours are kind of dull. I was expecting more frankly. Reckon it's predictable as well, the last hour was entertaining though."
2062,With so many plot holes reshoots cringy and illogical scenes and cutting out 1.5 hours runtime from 4.5 hours you called this cinematic event. Cinematic Event was Infinity War and always will be Infinity War was1000 times better than this crap
2063,"The end of an era as fans might say and to which I say ""I agree."" With that said it was a failed attempt at making history and ending up being garbage. I'll take nothing away from the acting nor the special effects and of course that portal scene. It was absolutely AMAZING!! As for the rest of the movie it was s**t. I can't believe that a rat saved the universe and say what you will about Tony Stark actually ""saving"" it, but you would be wrong and you are so suck it. Anyways, making Thor fat was a big mistake and ruined the character that just started to become iconic. In the final battle of the movie I was not in my seat with excitement more of dissatisfaction if anything and that is because it was such a one sided battle like seriously I felt they took a page out of Fairy Tail and made everyone that wasn't apart of the Avengers or heroes weak. I ""love"" the fact that there is only one hero who dies in the battle and it was really pointless because they could have just revived him with the Time Stone. The greatest weapon in the universe was tossed around like a game of Hot Potato what a shame. If nothing else kill Captain America as well as a few other heroes such as War Machine. Yes. Black Widow died, but it was less of a tole because she died the same way as Gamora a year prior and why did she die it should have been Hawkeye. He is such a complete waste of time in the MCU and it's clear that Marvel doesn't see him as a strong character. When you really think about it Black Widow is getting a movie while Hawkeye gets a TV Series. It shows who they like more and Widow it dead. Professor Hulk sucks. Thanks for ruining him Marvel!! The last thing that didn't sit well with me was dissing every single time traveling movie. In conclusion this movie should been a trilogy so that there could have been more built rather than something that felt to rush to the end and start on a new chapter. I like to think that it could have been like ""Lord of the Rings"" and what that trilogy accomplished and I don't think anyone would have complained about that. This movie is a joke."
2064,"In her solo-movie, we learn that she has incredible powers and should be the key to an ending to the war.Then in this movie, she is absent all along and when she shows up, she is suddenly weaker? I couldn't help but recognise that the other male superheroes (who are less powerful than Captain Marvel), as Captain America, get unfairly too much more attention than her.I would say same about Thor, he is literally a god and then this Captain America appear to be stronger???It's pretty clear that the producers favour certain characters.This makes the movie incoherent and a bit nagging."
2065,"Every thing is just so balanced.
It was so good that i wanted to rewatch it again after i walked out of the theaters."
2066,"Basically, a clip-show. The writing is uncharacteristically sub-par. The whole endeavor is uncharacteristically formulaic. The actors turn in their usual grade-A performances, but deadened by a dead script. Too many elements are gratuitous. If you're new to the franchise, don't judge it by this; if you've been with it for the whole ride--but remain somewhat objective--I'm afraid you might be disappointed."
2067,"Reason why I am not disappointed by this movie is because I wasn't expecting much from it in a first place.Infinity war was 'perfectly balanced': action scenes, motivation of characters, humor. Endgame wants to be the same movie, but it simply cannot reach that level.Things I liked:
Humor level is pretty good. It's not overwhelming and there is enough.
Visuals - obviously, action scenes... as well as everything else looks amazing.
Feeling of nostalgia - can't deny, there are tons of references you will find at this movie and it feels amazing to spot every small detail of this universe. (Not gonna work, if you haven't watched majority of marvel movies).Things I am neutral about:
Time travel: the very moment characters started to talk about time travel, I had a bad feeling. Ironically, they even inserted jokes about time travel movies and ultimate phrase: ""It's not how time travel works"".
After Thanos stated that he ""shred stones to atoms"" I was expecting they will just use quantum realm to restore the stones without time-travel stuff. However, at the same time it would neglect huge part of Nostalgia, so I'm undecided on this. The major hole of time travel I noticed is ending with old Steve, who spent his life in another timeline (if I understood correctly) and somehow ended up on the bench in the original timeline without using a machine.Things I disliked:
Pace of the movie: It starts really slow, almost boring. And when the main story actually starts to be interesting and intense (which is after 75% of the movie), there is simply no place to insert character interactions I would like to see. Most of the characters, who died in IW has like 5-30 seconds of screen time and only few of them even says a word.To sum up, Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it's also not terrible.
Experience from it is truly individual.
If you weren't following marvel movies story-line and characters, or you feel indifferent to them - it will be just an average marvel movie with full bag of stereotypes you love/hate.
In case you liked all previous movies, this - will be no exception."
2068,"It's great Avengers finally beat Thanos, iron man took 6 infinity stones from Thanos and flipped the fingers, Thanos became dust left away, but for the whole movie totally no need 181 minutes, I want to say 60% of the part is nonsense and boring, doesn't relate to the plotNot worth for 181 minutes, I think only took 90min for the movie that's all"
2069,"There are already a surfeit of general reviews for this movie, so I am going to focus on the central conceit of the plot - time travel - and the way it is handled.The time travel device is flagged with the tongue firmly in the cheek, as the characters break the fourth wall to share jokes with the audience about how all our time travel knowledge comes from... movies. Therefore it is not knowledge at all, and we can freely revolutionize our sense of time travel on the fly. Yay!So the old logic of time travel - that you change and endanger the present by messing with the past in any way - is done away with. And a new logic of time travel is introduced: now changing the past in no way affects the present, instead just creating new parallel timelines. Or, to put it as the Avengers' writers do, the 'past' that I visit is actually in my future. It is not even really happening in the past...(?)Thus, to use (and modify appropriately) the old Back To The Future premise, if I go back and tell my past self the outcome of a bunch of sporting events and advise making a bet or two, I will not be one penny richer when I get back to the present, because that is not really my past self. It is my past self from another timeline, one who got rich using a list of sporting results from the future. Get it?I must say that when Avengers:Endgame proposed this premise I was initially very happy with it. Honestly, it makes a hell of a lot more sense than the normal time travel logic, for one simple reason: if there is only one timeline (as in most time travel movies), time traveling to the past and changing it is highly likely to prevent the time travel taking place, certainly in the way that it did in the initial, non-past-changed version of the present.So for instance, if I go back and kill Thanos as a child (as Ant-Man suggests), he never gets the stones, I am never prompted to time travel by him killing half the universe, and the time travel never happens, so who exactly went back to kill Thanos? Certainly not the version of me in the present in which Thanos is dead! When you think about it, there MUST be two timelines: one where Thanos had the stones and, in desperation, I went back in time and killed him; and another where I was chillin', because I never heard of Thanos, because he was dead. Simple, right?Why, then, I hear you cry, did most if not all previous time travel movies not notice and obey the clearly superior logic of time travel - namely that changing the past cannot affect the present - followed by Avengers:Endgame?The answer is fiendishly simple: If time travel creates alternate timelines rather than changing the present, it also creates no possibilities for dramatic jeopardy, because nothing I do in the past makes much difference. And this is true not just for the present, but also for the past. Are you with me? Allow me to explain...Say I go back to the past - not far in the past, just five minutes - and empty my own wallet, which is on the kitchen table (let's say it contains a 20 pound note). I now return to the future with 20 quid in my hand, but when I go to the kitchen and look in my wallet, guess what? The money is still there! I now have forty quid in total, the only caveat being that the two notes have the exact same serial number. Notice how this is a totally zero-sum game. There is only 20 pound for each version of reality, and if one has an extra one, another must be missing one.But suddenly, I feel bad about robbing my past/alternate self of his 20 pound, and decide to go back again, to four minutes in the past, and give my self back the money. But when I get there, guess what? I cannot do it! Because I am going back to my own version of four minutes ago, in which I never lost the 20 quid. All I can do is create a third timeline, which was visited by a friendly version of future me handing out money, in addition to the second timeline which was visited a by a greedy version of future me taking money. (now a three-way zero-sum game)To put it another way. If changing things five minutes ago does not change the present, then it also does not change any point between five minutes ago and the present.Let's take another scenario. I make up a codeword, and then go back to five minutes ago and tell my past self (call him me2) that word, before returning to the present. Once I get back to the present, I can never visit me2 again, because he is no longer in my past. In my past I made up the word just now, but he was told the word five minutes ago by his future self.So if I go back in time and borrow something (an Infinity Stone for instance) I cannot give it back, ever. Because when I next visit the past, it will be my past, not the slightly funky alternative past I spawned last time by borrowing an Infinity Stone.Thus, when Hulk promised the Ancient One that he would be right back with her stone, she would have calmly explained that this was not possible, because by merely appearing in her reality he had forked it off from his own, and the version of the past he returned to next time would feature a new her, complete with stone, and with no memory of meeting him.In other words, if changing the past does not change the present, then the past resets itself every time I travel back in time. In every way.The problem (from dramatic perspective) is, this makes the past a very boring place. I can go back and kill someone (even myself) a million times, but every time I come back they will be alive and well, totally clueless about the many deaths they have suffered at my hands. It also almost makes the present like a computer game cheat mode, because I can double my resources anytime by just going back one minute and robbing myself!The movie tried to get around this by making time travel dependent on a finite number of Pym particles, but the exact same logic applies here. You can go back five minutes and rob yourself of all your Pym particles as many times as you like. Sure those timelines are now not going to be able to stop Thanos, but ultimately, what does it matter? There are already, according to this logic of time travel, infinite timelines where Thanos wins, and infinite timelines where Thanos loses, and none of them matter to you at all. Maybe those suckers you robbed in the past are better off without their Pym particles? You will never know or have any way of finding out.Clearly this logic of time travel, whilst certainly theoretically appealing, creates levels of silliness that no ordinary film could hope to cope with. I needn't bother revisiting the specific instances but suffice to say that the movie was forced to throw its own time travel logic out of the window almost before it had been elaborated by Banner in the early discussions, and continued to throw it out the window to the bitter end(game).There is one possible answer to this, which the more generous devotees might propose. Perhaps Banner is wrong about the past not affecting the future, but either doesn't know it or doesn't want to tell the others because the implications are too crazy to think about. Sadly this makes no sense on many levels, for instance because Tony Stark would clearly have invented time travel a lot earlier had he been aware of time traveling versions of himself and others before the whole Infinity War happened. This, the version of Stark visited and robbed by his future self certainly was, unless that technologically advanced SHIELD building had no CCTV.In conclusion, love the time travel concept proposed by this film. It deserves a thorough treatment in a film willing to explore its weird implications. But sadly this movie does not follow it through, and never could have done, given all the mad fights, one-liners and dramatic moments they had to fit in.In hindsight, it looks like the Russos were desperate, they painted themselves into a corner, and they resorted in the end(game) to the last refuge of the script charlatan - an inconsistent time travel premise - to creep out of it. It was still a fun time. But a quality film or satisfying conclusion to the story arc, not so much."
2070,"Okay, again I don't know how to define Miss Marvel, she sometimes seems powerful, but other times seems weak and most of the time completely useless. She claims not to have time for Earth when Thanos snapped, yet if she had been there she might have help or prevented it from happening in the first place.
Yet I don't know if she has the power, as it's all over the place. Okay, she somehow flies and shots energy beams by getting the power from the Space Stone ? Makes no senses.
But at last she's got powers, strong enough to fly through leaser beams and a spaceship, yet not strong enough to get past common foot soldiers ?
Okay a fluke I guess.
Later she tries to take the gauntlet from Thanos, something even Cap. American almost did alone, yet she can't, but she can take a headbutt from him no problem, it is almost like he is all CGI right there. Sigh
And she has the IG for a long time, yet she never takes it on to end the treat, no it has to be a normale human that does that, even though it seems she would handle that power just as good as the Hulk,as she did adsorb powers from a stone with no problems. And she has plenty of time while the female ""heroes"" assembles around her to help her, becasue her powers are all over the place.Why did you take so much away from Thor and Hulk, we really needed the two most powerful heroes in this fight, yet they are reduced to jokes most of the time, and Thor just say that he is no leader in the end, yet that was what Thor 3 was all about.Then there is the death of Black Widow, the one we all hoped would finally get a movie, guess this is Disney's way of telling us no on that.
The death of Ironman felt like the death of the Marvel Universe, the journey that came to a close and was telegraphed from a mile away.
And lastly you made Cap. America grow old, at least with his love, but it would have been better to show his slow aging instead, so he could still be a supporter to the cause.I feel like this is the last movie of Avengers we will ever get, as they are almost all dead, left or retired, and the supporting actors don't seem like they will go on either. We will get Spiderman and GoTG I hope, but it really will not feel tied in any longer.Also there is a huge plot hole in the movie, as there is now double the amount of all people again, yet for the last 5 years they have only needed to grow food for the ones that din't die, so there will be world hunger for years on all planets. Not to mention all those that died because the pilot, driver, nuclear engineer and so on was snapped away will still be dead.
So there will be lots of wars and unrest in all the world, not to mention the people that came back is 5 years younger in mind and body, but would be 5 years older according to the justice system and so on, and would have been declared dead so they wouldn't have any assets either."
2071,"Endgame consistently felt off from the start to the end. The tone is just strange, the pacing is messy and the plotholes are ridiculous and badly effect the enjoyment of the film. That said there are some fun scenes.This felt more like a tying up of loose ends rather than a real self-contained film. While I liked Infinity War they really backed themselves into a corner when they got time travel involved. So many plot holes and convoluted plot lines concerning time travel.... How is Captain America able to come back at the end if he has gone to a different time line? This is a direct contradiction of something they said previously in the film - that going back into time does not change the future. But, lo and behold, Captain America is suddenly in this very timeline, but somehow without affecting it? This makes no sense.How does Captain Marvel know where Tony Stark is??! In the vast endless expanse of space she somehow randomly comes across him!!? This is never explained.Stark figuring out time travel in about 2 minutes is just laughable.How can Thanos be so powerful without the infinity gauntlet so that he can easily defeat Thor, Iron man and Captain America all at once?!? This was the most fun fight scene by far but it is partly ruined by its illogical premises. Reminds me of Star Trek Discovery where we are supposed to be dazzled by the spectacle and not take plot continuity seriously anymore.As other people have pointed out they ruined the character development they had set up with Thanos' character. This wonderfully rich character is killed in the first 5 mins of the film. Only to be replaced by his more one dimensional past self later. It might as well have been any generic bad guy. There is no satisfying link to the Thanos of the first film.Fat comedy Thor really disrespects his character and just looks and feels so silly. They could have made him depressed and overweight sure, but why make it so pronounced that it becomes hard to take seriously. He has become a (bad) parody of himself. I like the comedy element of these films but please take it back a notch.The interactions between Stark and Rodgers seemed stale and repetitive. It was hard to care anymore. I actually liked the Hulk/Banner hybrid - this was one of the more inventive/original parts of the film. It would have been good to see him actually fight! I liked the interactions between Hawkeye and Black Widow. Their relationship has always been interesting/layered and well acted.The final battle scene felt like a rehash of the one in Wakanda. So, again, hard to get excited about something we have seen before. But of course, it has its fun moments. I loved seeing Scarlet Witch take on Thanos one on one and get the better of him until he calls on the big guns.It seems like the story line of IW bit off more than it could chew. It becomes so overblown and fantastical that it is hard to take seriously anymore. A bit of an anti-climax. But of course its still a must-see because its the culmination of a decade of Marvel films. I still enjoyed this film to an extent, its just a bit disappointing. I could have easily sat through another hour of this if it helped sort out the pacing problems and made more sense of things."
2072,"The movie had an epic tale and fights and humor like you would expect in a Marvel movie....butThis is a spoilerWhen the people are brought back, they bring them back 5 YEARS after they left and I presume they ended up in the exact same spot.
If 3.5 BILLION people were to suddenly materialize there would not be enough food, shelter or ability to deal with them. The entire world economy and welfare would self-destruct.After 5 years many people would have moved on...married other people, moved away changed jobs whereas the people 'coming back' would have nothing since they would have probably been declared dead.What about someone coming back into their old bedroom only arrive while another couple (who bought the house from the estate of the person who vanished) were having sex.What about people who vanished from cars on the highway. Did they return only to be run down and killed?That flaw ruins a good story for me. I expect a bit of stupidity in any movie to fit a script to a story, but this one was too glaring to deal with."
2073,"Fight scenes was really trash. Movie was totally boring except Tony Stark scene. Tony Stark scene was really good, and that was the only good scene in this movie. Most of jokes in the movie was childish. I didn't even smile to most of jokes, just Lebowski and Raccoon's ""Boom"" jokes was really good. After i watched Infinity War, this movie was like a trash for me."
2074,"Seriously, as a Hulk fan, I walked away so disappointed. They started humiliating Hulk with Ragnarok, then Infiniti war, where we thought they are keeping him for a climax. Next thing you know, Mr. Hulk crying and wiping his tears! Reminded me with DC killing their flagship Charecter Superman. I just gave it 6 respecting the effort of making the film though."
2075,"I want to give it 7/10 but +1 just for the potential of film makers who could present this conclusion.IW was just too perfect. Endgame must have been on the top of it, but sadly it is not.Despite of the difficulty to continue with the storyline after thanos' snap, this end is satisfactory.I think film makers should have taken one more part of Avengers to bring down the conclusion. This way they could bring more action to it."
2076,"Exciting, fun, solid and beautiful, worthy of Oscar"
2077,"No better words can describe this bizarre and uncomfortable anomaly. It carries a sanctimony dwarfing even Saving Private Ryan, as cinema history now replaces actual history. As the camera passed the ensemble, I saw Michael Douglas and my eyes immediately looked for Charlie Sheen. Michelle Pfeiffer in black drab, I looked for Barnabas Collins. The great popcorn funeral, then why stop short at Marvel? In fact the death of America is all across this. (The subliminal programming of Joe Biden as Captain America was screamingly obvious.) Remember, none of this is preposterous as the movie itself. The time heist is closest to examining its theater in the way of Dickens, which provides a decade of cinema to act against so continues this new tradition of cinema as memory functioning via its own footage as our own psychology on screen. It's always regret, what if, accepting failure, parental. ""When you time travel, time fights back."" It's saying the universe is self-aware, unfolding, and we play into it. See how most in the past are willing to accept the truth--except--when they face themselves, then it's antagonism and sarcasm in every case. As in ego in the way of the collectivist utopia. Most interesting is Thanos's relationship with future Thanos, they never meet, but the villain aiding himself in outcomes as the output adjusts the input, creates a cinema study in machine learning as omnipotence. ""A world where no one knows the horrors that led to their existence."" This is already the case. Remember he won 11,999,999 times, making this film in god's eye where the monkeys bash the keyboard to a perfect series of events in self-sacrifice and the unity of the collectivist hive: the women army, the buddhist army, the african army, twenty films join in one to destroy the fascist eugenicist. But with twelve million realities and just one being our film, then isn't half dying overwhelmingly the lesser of evils compared to millions of realities everyone died due to their meddling? Their good intention becomes an abominable evil compared to Thanos's great heroism in saving half the universe. Lastly, the 'all in one' showdown is like Ready Player One except the Oasis is the cinema screen itself. Cinema is realizing a mind of its own and turning the game against us. (Should Marvel have a seat in the UN next?) Theater was once a vessel for humanity to ritualize its experience in boldness and vividness, now instead humanity is the vessel of cinema to awaken itself to our form. The hyper-reactivity doesn't pantomime our dramas rather it's the agenda of the hyper A.I. to replace us with this sort of proto-idealism. All the while we merrily train the borg like captcha through our dollars giving it the exact schematics to dictate us. The snap of the thumb kills the audience instead."
2078,"Just epic
Editing was a bit extreme but it is needed"
2079,Just go watch it I promise you won't regret itP.S. don't wait for the after credits scene there are none
2080,"That movie was so emotional, yet full of action. Funny, yet deep with meaning. The plot line was so well thought out, that it gave you the impression it's impossible for a human brain to actually pull this off. Every little detail clicked, every scene had its meaning. I've never laughed and cried and were at the edge of my seat all at the same time, in a single movie. I thought it was gonna be just a re-do, a battle and then bye-bye Avengers era. But, no. It was so much more. It was an epic way to mark a 10 year old journey. Russo brothers, you blew me away. You better get an oscar for that screen writing. Oh, and RDJ you are a brilliant actor. You deserve all the millions they gave you. EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY."
2081,"As an avid MCU Films fan, the Avengers: Endgame was by far THE BEST MCU FILM. For 10 years MCU has always delivered blockbuster movies and Endgame felt like their BIG BANG or LAST HURRAH; a trophy for all the 20 MCU films we have seen and loved.Sitting through a 3-hour film never felt this quick but it was not short of satisfaction. It gave me all the feels, from laughs, to tears, to being in awe, to surprises.However, I wouldn't recommend watching this without watching all the MCU Films before this.Avengers: Endgame is WORTH THE HYPE. This is the finale that will stay with us."
2082,"I think some people are getting paid for these reviews. EG was such a letdown after the awesome Infinity War. I was ok with the demise of Stark as he was the one normal human. Captain America as an old man was bad. But by far, fat Thor was insulting to the fans. Movies, especially of this supposed caliber, are better off avoiding the lure of time travel to fix the situation. I would like for them to travel in time and do this movie properly."
2083,"The time travel idea that this movie is based on is childish, making some of the scenes predictable. Overall a great movie, but still far behind many other great ones."
2084,Straight away a 10/10...no question. Anyone who votes less than a 9/10 should ask the question 'what is the meaning of life?' Or even better as 'why am I here on this planet?' Yes there are loopholes...you try making 21 movies and making them all relate to one another and also please comic fans at the same time. Fitting closure to Iron Mans story. So emotional and well put together. The movie was made by fans and for fans. So thankful such a masterpiece was made in my time!!!!
2085,"I was very excited to watch the grand finale of this 10 year journey but I must confess, I expected more... it's not terrible but it's average with individual funny moments...it didn't hit the mark for me.
The story starts well and builds up nicely when the team is reassembled, but I really didn't like their take on Thor Lebowski (looking like this insecure overweight guy) and The Hulk (who knows takes selfies and can talk about philosophy).
In my humble opinion it killed the essence of those characters, they could have linked the Hulk with the Maestro and Thor to have a moment of redemption coming back to his old self.
The final battle didn't feel organic like the one in infinity war, some unnecessary characters appeared and relevant ones like Dr Strange had little contribution.
I liked the ending for Steve Rogers and Iron Man"
2086,Im not gonna spoil this. Full of emotions out there... sacrifice... love ... and action..❤
2087,"Some great moments but so many disappointing ones in the midst of it all:1. Thor from the Thor movies and the avengers ones previously to this Thor was easily the most annoying aspect.2. HULK... any need for him when he doesn't smash or add to action scenes?? He's a wasted character for several movies now so not quite as disappointing as Thor but you might as well just have Bruce Banner character only without any ""green""-ness as far as I'm concerned.3. Euphoria of some of the scenes dwindling away with the following scene but unnecessarily dragged out was criminal. Infinity war in comparison I walked out of the cinema completely blown away and giddy but it just wasn't like that in endgame.4. Plot holes (unless I misunderstood the whole time travelling issue), how was the future nebula able to kill the past nebula with no repercussions? The vormir thing with Hawkeye and black widow wanting to sacrifice themselves for the other. How would there that much love between them to warrant the release of the soul stone to the other?5. Thanos: Almost as disappointing as Thor. The Thor and Thanos from Infinity War were like Ali v Frazier/Foreman. In this they became Audley Harrison v David Price for no reason whatsoever.There were probably more things but this failed to deliver following infinity war. At the same time there were some parts I was thrilled with i.e. the return of the avengers during the battle scene (although another thing that annoyed me was it felt like there was only 10 minutes of action in the three hours and after the action in infinity war it was annoying).Come at me if you want but you know I am right :D"
2088,"I'm coming at this as someone who read the comics and who also invested in this franchise since 2008 as a 15 year old kid, when I was the only one in my entire high school or inner circle who could comprehend what was about to unfold and told everyone about who The Avengers were and what they're all about.To be frank, time traveling is a lazy way to rewrite or undo everything that came before. But, there are films that do it well and I was going in with that optimism that they might try something clever. Ultimately it is the same time traveling mumbo-jumbo. It does try to cover the tried trope with moments of nostalgia, and to it's credit it even made me feel that way.But with that being said, that wasn't the biggest issue, it was some of the character decisions that the Russos, Feige and writers Markus & McFeely chose. I cannot review this without spoilers, so here it goes.I really disliked Thor's arc. I didn't appreciate the joke they made him into. It just didn't work for me. I've elaborated many times, more often than not the MCU's child-like and formulaic humor can really get on my nerves. I was expecting a tone just a little more dower, similar to Infinity War. I like it when things are taken a little more seriously which is why I put Infinity War, Civil War, The Winter Soldier, and the first Iron Man on such high pedestal. Seeing him out of shape and acting like a frat-boy was unpleasant. Odin's lesson of being there for his people has been lost with Thor's ending, it's as if all the growth in Ragnarok was gone in this film.As for Captain America, well, I did find it kinda fitting, but I would have preferred to have seen Rogers make the ultimate sacrifice himself alongside Tony Stark. The universe revolves around both of them and I personally would have found it more poetic if the two heartbeats of the MCU go out in heroic fashion. Ultron once called him out on ""pretending to live without war."" As much as I found Ultron to be a tad underwhelming, I found that quote from him to have poignancy and also one of the reasons why Captain America is so interesting. Tony Stark, can't help himself but to always fix things, with Steve Rogers, he cannot turn away from any situation that goes south. Even if time traveling in this film apparently splits off to another parallel timeline, I still don't find it in Steve Rogers who gave up his own love, his own time to the greater good, to only check out and retire like the way he did.I had no problem with Tony's death, as a matter of fact I love the fact that Endgame wasn't afraid to kill Black Widow and Iron Man. The MCU started with Downey's Iron Man, so I found it reasonable that it should end with him. Nat's death only develops Hawkeye, who has way more to do in this film than he ever did in the previous installments. It was time for the MCU to not have any ""fake-outs"" and really show that heroes can die. I remember what Whedon said during his tenure with Marvel. It's war, and in war people die, and when the war is won, there is always a cost in a victory.Thanos this time around got the short end of the stick. Brolin again delivers on his performance, and I understand, this movie is more about the Avengers than it is about Thanos, but I just did not like the fact that they killed him in the first twenty minutes and we got a pre-Infinity War Thanos.But, the Big Three, Downey Jr, Evans and Hemsworth deliver. The rest of the cast is good. Jeremy Renner is at his best here like I previously mentioned. Johansson is also very good, and it was nice to see her and Renner's characters bounce off each other like they used to, making her death only more tragic. Karen Gillan who salvaged a small portion of the redundant Guardians 2, also brings her A-game and Nebula's arc here is handled very well. It was also very cool to see Professor Hulk and Ruffalo does a great job being at peace with himself. The rest of the cast, Larson, Cheadle, Rudd, and Cooper are great.Now, we all knew the dusted would return, and that scene really gave me goosebumps momentarily. The action in this film is not on the level of Infinity War. It's solid action, and some very cool moments, but it pales in comparison to the Titan fight, the Wakanda battle, and the opening NY fight in Infinity War. Thanos does however go against the Big Three and that was a treat, especially his fight against Cap, but the rest of the action lacked the extra flare that made the fight sequences in Infinity War so awesome. At the very least, the characters are used well. VFX is also top notch.Ultimately, I enjoyed good amount of moments within the film, and technically speaking it's very well made, but I walked out of this unfulfilled and unsatisfied. I'm not comfortable with the direction they took, especially on the characters I mentioned and I know putting people up to my standards is ridiculous, but I can have high expectations for this because again, I've invested in the MCU for 10+ years. I'll need time to let it sink in and maybe if I watch it again I'll think differently, but its as if the Russos and Markus & McFeely exhausted all options and ran out of gas after delivering film after film.7/10"
2089,Totally worth a watch and it caps the series off well but it's pacing is a bit erratic for my tastes.It'll be interesting to see what comes in the new phases. I won't say more because this movie deserves to have none of the secrets spoiled.Go see it guys.
2090,Ehh it was predictable and the last one was better
2091,"Well...most of them.The film opens on Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye with his happy family...until he no longer has one on account of them being dusted, which causes him to become vengeful Mohawkeye. Next up it's my least favourite Avenger, Tony Snark, teaching games to Nebula (my favourite Guardian of the Galaxy and the only one of those a-holes I actually LIKE. Mantis, who I also like and who *isn't* an a-hole, sadly only gets one line in the movie, but at least it's a funny one). The term drawn-out could be used to describe this whole opening with Tony. 'Self-indulgent' would be another. Just because you have a 3-hour+ runtime, Russos, doesn't mean you should waste it lingering on Tony sleeping, etc. I did appreciate, though, that Nebula shows she's grown (as evidenced by the fact she's refrained from beating the snot out of Tony the entire time they've been stuck in space together). I was happy to see her featured so much.Thankfully things finally get moving once Captain Marvel saves their butts and interacts with the team in a scene most have probably watched already. As she points out to rude Rhodey (whose main role seems to be Joke/Movie Reference Man), she's been on other planets after 'The Snap' that *didn't* have The Avengers to help them out. The fact that THOR says he likes her should be enough (though obviously won't be for certain people). He also learns from the mistake he made at the end of Infinity War regarding what bodypart to aim for on Thanos (who apparently wiped out half the universe's populace so he could become a farmer and unfortunately destroyed the Infinity Stones). Too bad Nebula's robbed of the chance to end Thanos in this movie (twice!), as she probably deserved to the most. Tony the Drama Queen proves he hasn't grown at all, laying the blame for everything at Cap's feet.A skip to five years later reveals time hasn't been kind to Thor. I'm saddened to see him reduced to this joke, when the first Thor movie is one of my favourites. They've veered too far into 'comedy' for my taste, as here he's played mostly for laughs on account of letting himself go (for those wanting shirtless Thor, you'll get him...though you'll wish you *hadn't*). Bless Paul Rudd's Scott Lang, as he brings a breath of fresh air to proceedings. His reunion with his (now grown) daughter is one of the few genuinely effective emotional moments in the film. Unfortunately, he's not given the respect he deserves, considering he's the one to come up with the idea of time travel (the subject of which is given the ultimate nerd discussion in this film). They go to Tony, who selfishly refuses to help the others get back everyone they lost since he already HAS everyone HE wants (well...except for Spider-Kid, who is the reason he eventually changes his mind).Cut to after a 'comedic' sequence involving working out the kinks of time-travelling, the gang splits up to retrieve all the stones from the past. This is where the film kicks into gear, as we revisit past MCU films and encounter previous versions of characters. Highlights include: Cap seeing Peggy Carter again, Cap vs Past Cap, Thor spending some precious time with his soon-to-be-deceased mother (plus, a Jane cameo! There's actually lots of cameos in the film, but only a few I cared about) and twice the amount of Nebula. There's one rage-inducing consequence of visiting the past involving Mohawkeye, Natasha and the Soul Stone. If you remember what happened with Gamora, you'll know what that means. Although the character who ends up being the sacrifice gets some good character/emotional beats in this film, it still doesn't make up for the fact they're unceremoniously given the 'permadeath' treatment, thus robbing us of one of the MCU's best characters and the awesome dynamics between them and other characters. Given all the others that could've been offed, WHY'd it have to be...well...you'll see.I'll give the film credit for seamlessly blending the 'present' characters with the past, and once things reach the climax, they definitely ensure this is the most 'epic' battle we've seen yet which involves pretty much every character (except those who're unfortunate enough to *stay* dead, of course), some of which will be getting future films or TV shows to appear in. I guess that's meant to 'make up for' them not getting much screentime here (like my fave, Wanda. At least she gets some revenge on Thanos and shares an emotional moment with Mohawkeye near the end. I'm looking forward to her show and hopefully future movie appearances too). Captain America gets at least two cheer-worthy moments, while Captain Marvel and her new haircut get to kick some major arse (don't fret, haters...she isn't given the final victory over Thanos. No, we all know who gets THAT privilege).I guess I was supposed to feel sad near the end, but honestly I just felt relief, as it's about time a certain someone faced some actual real consequences. Hopefully other characters will get to thrive/have substantial screentime now that somebody isn't hogging it all. Another good thing about the end is the camera shot which slowly moves through/covers everyone (all these characters we've come to know, plus a few we haven't yet) at the funeral. The BEST part, however, is the final scene. I've waited ever since the first Cap movie (my other fave MCU film) to get to the scene that ends this movie, and I think it's worth it. I'm so very happy with it and who it involves.While there're no mid-credits/post-credits scenes, it's worth sticking around to see the original six Avengers actors literally signing off. It'll probably take a couple of viewings to fully digest this film, as it throws in everything AND the kitchen sink. It's a fitting conclusion to Phase 3 (ignoring Spider-Kid 2). Now, bring on Phase 4!"
2092,"Thank God I *didn't* see this on Thursday night like I originally wanted to. Man, did I feel every...single...one of those 181 minutes.Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. Some scenes were definitely funny, some touched me tremendously and I had a huge warmth in my heart for nostalgia for the other MCU chapters. But, boy...one full hour could've been cut and the tightened film would've been so much better.My father, who joined me during this film, had not seen Avengers 3a (ah-hem, ""Infinity War."") So, before this 3b part (aka: ""Endgame,"") I took roughly 10 seconds to explain that first part to this conclusion movie. I summed up 2½ hours of footage...in 10 seconds. He didn't think it sounded like a good movie, to which I corrected him. Part 3a was a great movie and you never felt those 2½ hours because it was chock-full of action, almost non-stop. Just because it had a basic premise, it still had depth and so much going on, you should be on the edge of your seat the entire film.And the opposite is true here. This is what I recall feeling when I watched Kill Bill Vol 2. I was so excited because Kill Bill Vol 1 was so action-packed and fun, I was looking forward to the same in the concluding volume. Nope. The breaks were put on from like 90mph to 15.Again, don't get me wrong. I really did enjoy both Kill Bill Vol. 2 and this Avengers 3b movie. It's just not what I expected in the least. It's definitely well made, thought out and has all the elements you desire. It just takes such a long time to get the goods. And by goods, I'd say, aside from all the one-off great scenes of comedy/reminiscence, the climax had me almost out of my seat, clapping and cheering.The neat part of this experience was the aftermath. Rarely do we get to see the actual destruction after an evil villain actually succeeds like Thanos did in Part 3a. 3b is that movie. This is the What-If-Comes-Sadly-True. And I enjoyed that idea a bit until the movie finally kicks in - about an hour or so in.Not gonna ruin any specifics, but suffice to say, the movie's, naturally, about the Avengers attempting to figure out how to win after the last movie's defeat. Kinda like Return of the Jed-I to The Empire Strikes Back. (Though...Star Wars Episode VI does a much better job of the same story.)Is this a recommendation? Of course. Go and slam your money down and get a ticket. There is absolutely zero reason to NOT see this if you've seen Part 3a or, hell, any of the other MCU. But, maybe just once. Okay, twice, with the second time at home to catch anything you might have missed. And keep in mind, overall it's best to have seen ALL 21 prior movies to really appreciate/understand this one.***Final thoughts: Whew! I think I did it. I think I wrote a completely spoiler-free review. These kinds of movies takes me off social media the whole week leading up to my weekend viewing as I am worried about spoilers. I guess, you're welcome."
2093,"This movie was the end of 22 movies... Supposed to be the most intense movie of all time. Yet infinity war had way more emotion and way better script. I even think that age of ultron was better. All they focused on was linking all the 22 movies into one and fan service. I feel for that reason it wasn't as impactful as infinity war. The way they end the characters stories was ok, i would have done it differently and done something that would make your heart drop, like they did in the first 5 min of the movie. And also they did something to a certain character and all i can say is WHY, SO STUPID. 7 may seem like a descent rating but i am very disappointed because this movie had unlimited potential and now i'll never get to see the endgame i wanted to."
2094,"ENDGAME is not what you're expecting, yet it's also exactly the impressive epic you're chasing. It takes our central heroes to new places and wraps up Marvel's decade-long journey so beautifully. The ending is emotionally overwhelming. I'm thankful to the entire team for giving us a special movie that will long live in our heart."
2095,Only 1 word for this movie. WOW. This is so spectacular and great movie.
2096,"7 h ago I left zur cinema, but I m still left for words ... that movie totally flashed me even though I partly knew what would happen at the end (thats the problem With watching trailers so DON'T!)... I Think the last Time that happened to me was when I first saw LotR 3Even so the movie has its funny scenes it is much darker than most of the previous MCU movies...I really loved that beginning with hawkeye haveing a good time with his family but just seconds later he realized they are all gone cause of thanos snap...
So did the end...In a huge battle about Planet earth and the infinity glove You finally get to see that 1 out of 14 Million 6 hundred and 5 outcomes Dr. Strange saw... when the whole world and all ever seen MCU heroes fight thanos army (brought back by a snap of Hulk with time travelled Infinity gaunlet) Not Thor or Captain Marvel gets the final punch to end Thanos... it has to be the one all started with: IRON MAN ... just minutes after he holds Peter in his arms again he takes the Chance to sacrificed himself (he got a daughter with pepper now) and puts on the infinity gaunlet and snap away thanos and his army ... but also his Life (as the stones are to powerful) ... that was one hell of an emotional scene and that will be forever burnt in my mind
And there are others too that sacrificed their life: black widow gave her life to get hawkeye the soul stone (same as gamora did) and cap who is still alive but in his 80s now and took the chance to live his life with peggy while bringing back all infinity stones at the end of the movieEveryone knows that this is the best way to end avengers ... a heroic moment for Iron man the guy everything started with and changing his attitude in the best way ever possible...This is a 10/10 movie because it leaves u speechless... R.i.P Tony"
2097,What an amazing film! I wouldn't change a thing about it. The film is very long but worth every minute. A good mixture of comedy and action.Advice: go to the toilet before you watch it!
2098,Fruitful movie with lots of surprises. I believe i didn't witness a better movie than this.
2099,"The most anticipated film of the year: Reviewing ""Avengers: Endgame"" (NO SPOILERS)Saying this film gives fan service does not even begin to scratch the surface, as it is littered from beginning to end with quips. humor, forced appearances and minor characters. While being a send off to the old and an introduction to the new, this film was literally the end of the MCU as we know it, making me personally fear for the future of the franchise. It's not a bad film by any means, but it also fails to live up to the hype and emotion promised, although my screening was filled with thunderous applause, laughter, and literal sobbing at the end. Endgame is sort of a mess, and the story goes everywhere until finally reaching the climax. The film is split into three acts, all of which go entirely different directions, the first act is somber, yet humorous, for no reason at all. The second act is slightly confusing, but brilliant, bringing us back to different moments remembered throughout the MCU, and the third act is an all-out battle, not filmed particularly well. As far as films that wrap up a series go, with the 3-hour plus run-time, most of ""Endgame"" falls into the extremely average category, as more character growth should have been realized and the full potential of the original six Avengers, minus a couple, was never fully realized. Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and Jeremy Renner stand out in their respective roles, where Scarlett Johanson, Mark Ruffalo, and Chris Hemsworth feel greatly under utilized. The more modern Avengers cast is fresh, for the most part, but we begin to see where the MCU has over-saturated the franchise itself, as some characters that are even in briefly are far too invincible for a Universe based in modern times. The conclusion of the film will bring tears to some, but it's the closing the original MCU deserves after 11 long years. See it in the theater. ""Infinity War"" was the superior film. 7.5/10"
2100,"A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga.
It brought you to the beginning, it remind you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is that dessert that make you overwhelmed and craved at the same time.
It closed one door to open up another, there is still a new journey ahead of us.
Great execution by Joe and Anthony Russo!"
2101,"The film is good enough, held together by the fact the Russo's know how to do set pieces and some pretty decent superhero performances from the main characters. Hence the 7 rating.
When Infinity War launched last year it shot straight to the top of my favourite film list. Endgame had the tools and opportunity and freedom to be better, it's just not. I have watched IW about 15 times and still get shivers when Iron Man first suits or Thor landing in Wakanda and stark vs Thanos, well this is just movie genius.
In comparison Endgame has terrible pacing, after 2 hours of time travel nonsense we get to the only real battle of the film and it felt rushed and messy. There was no time for character placements or anything. The whole throwing the gauntlet round like a football felt like it was out of the Incredibles.
They tried the best for fan service but as a huge fan i'm so sad about the list below1) Hulk actually fight at all especially Thanos
2) Iron-man use a new suit to actually wow me
3) Totally absolutely ruined Thor. This was an absolute travesty
4) Thanos was ruined alsoActually there is a massive list of things that I would have liked done different"
2102,"Too many jokes which make the movie very long to watch, but the end is totally worth it! Nice way to end those beautiful movies!"
2103,"The movie is ""okay"", but can´t reach the same intensity like Avengers: Infinity War. Sadly to say, that the production team missed the opportunity to deliver a milestone in superhero cinema. The effects and the shooting is top notch, but unfortunately that´s not all. It just looked like ""work on schedule"". So, don´t believe the media hype and don´t set your expectations too high. Entertaining? Yes... somehow if you forget about all the cringy moments! But really nothing more..."
2104,"After 21 films worth of waiting, Marvel has finally reached the conclusion to the Infinity Saga in Avengers: Endgame. The collective movies had mad billions of dollars, and captured the hearts of comic book fans around the world. The prior entry, Avengers: Infinity War added a certain sense of gravitas and catharsis to the Marvel Universe. The prior film left fans not only devastated, but with more questions than answers with it's cliffhanger, serial ending. So how does the conclusion fare? Are the Fallen avenged? Is Endgame worth the hype?One of my greatest praises of Shazam! was the amount of personal consequence it had. One of my biggest criticisms of most superhero movies is that the consequence is constantly about saving the world. This then makes saving the world a redundant outcome that we know the superheroes will eventually solve. With constant resurrections and story revisions, the Marvel Universe greatly lacked this. Yet even though the world saving was still the primary conflict of Endgame, the story contained personal consequence for each individual character that made the film far more endearing to the viewer. This filled the film with incredibly written, visceral moments of joy, pain, and everything in between.The amount of story-boarding that went into the film is insane. The run time is long, but a necessary evil to the human bladder to tie up so many loose ends within an incredibly convoluted plot. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has so many characters, and Endgame gives resolution to their individual strife, while raising questions that can be pursued in future films. It gives each character their own space in the spotlight while concurrently sharing it equally. It is absolute brilliant direction by the Russo brothers.I cannot justifiably call Endgame the singular greatest superhero film of all time. Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is still brilliant, and did not need 21 films of buildup. Yet it absolutely rivals the trilogy with the first Marvel film that takes a chance with the ultimate pathos. The film rewards the fans who have seen all of the films, even the poorer entries, while inviting new fans with instant accessibility. I never checked my watch, I never felt the need to get up from my seat, which is something that has never occurred for me within a three hour movie. Not every direction choice worked as intended, not every story point was logistically flawless, but it still works. I laughed, I cried, and sometimes even did bof. Not both, but BOF. I can't give Avengers:Endgame any grade worse than perfect.(Grade: 10/10)"
2105,"After watching this, I must say that the film is a bit hyped up and not excellent as a lot of reviewers have given it, but is overall a good solid film.The first three quarters of the film was quite slow paced to be honest. I feel as though they should have distributed the action and tension scenes throughout the film rather than kept most of it for the final quarter. The last action scene seemed a bit rushed also but had some nice moments. There are plenty of comedic and fan service scenes throughout, but just lacked the tension, action and the banter scenes (especially the ones between Ironman and Dr Strange) that I had really enjoyed in the previous Infinity War film.Some vague spoilers below:There are occasional sad scenes, especially at the end, if you're a Marvel film fan or watched many of the previous ones, and it seems that they have finished off the Avengers franchise, or at least have killed off some of the main characters, which is sad. Saying that, they have opened up the doors to expand the Marvel universe.I found the sub- plot line, in which they have to retrieve the soul stone, a little silly to be honest. They have copied it from the previous one and how did the characters not know that a sacrifice is required?? Although it was nice to see some of the time travel scenes, I think the story would have worked much better if the time travel element was left out. That is my opinion though.Hope you enjoy the film though. 8/10."
2106,"You had to do it This way?? I mean there wasn't any other options? I'm a crazy marvel fan, I die for any superhero movies, madly in love with avengers, but this ending ( which is literally the ending) p****d me off!
Ok first, why time travelling? It's soo lame and an old idea.
I'm so pissed off that I can't even for a second say a good thing about this movie, because of all the disappointments.
You really had to make Thor fat? Yeah we laughed a bit at first but that's it. They literally destroyed his god-ness,badassness, the greatest image. Dude, he was a damn god that everyone in theatre cheered for when landed on Earth in infinity war! And they changed him with a homeless guy. Very godly! And captain picks up his hammer (yeah he is also worthy (long live America), so they should have killed this pathetic person. Free him of his misery).The idea of hulk being able to take control of the other guy is ok (even though cliche), but if they can co-exists then bring him when needed!!!!!! Don't be like a stupid happy, calm person who just did yoga. What's the point??!You had to kill iron man? Of course it's a great ending and everyone will cry, every fan will say ' I love you 3000', but was it necessary? He literally was the only avengers ( other than hawk-eye, but seriously compare to others, no one cares for him)who had something to care, to lose, to love. He was happy. It's like they really wanted to make people emotional and cry, so let's kill the beloved arrogant, funny one. I mean Thor has nothing to lose, Natasha, Hulk, even Captain America. But no, kill iron man.Some scenes were meant to be epic, have meanings but ended up being too forced and unreal. Like the ""girls-power, femenism"" scene. Yeah all the women are there, it was too forced.
And the end of Captain America, he just decided to stay, and it was accepted! We can just forget the time travelling problems with that! But why? Because they wanted to make a happy ending for him. And he gave his shield to a black guy? Just again to satisfy some other viewers. It is so forced.I really don't care if no one agrees, obviously many says it's 10/10. And it is impossible to satisfy everyone.
actually I'm jealous of those who were satisfied. I wish I was too."
2107,I mean what is there to say other than wow this movie is just incredible. WOW
2108,"Absolutely loved it, every character gets a good chunk of screen time and they all use it to full effect, its laugh out loud funny at times, really touching at times."
2109,"The first time ever I physically facepalmed in cinema (those who saw it will know exactly which scene I mean...)Very similar to Infinity War - two thirds of the movie feels great, but the rest consists of ""epic"" action scenes and predictable ""close calls"" dumb and unrealistic to the point of me taking offense at the creators either considering me too stupid to notice, or worse, not even caring; followed by ""emotional"" scenes that are just too damn long, forced and badly acted to work.One unfortunate difference from Infinity War is that it still had a fantastic Thanos and a half-believable plot.I know physics don't apply in comic book movies, but I know a battle scene that I can enjoy doesn't have more than 5 participants and doesn't last 45 minutes!
Right, yay for teamwork, good guys have each others back and beat a formidable solo villain, it's corny but I get it. But there's a point when it's too much, and that point is about half way of where these movies take it.
A fight scene is epic when it builds up, not when 25 ""heroes"" - including every insignificant sidekick - take turns fighting random cannon fodder and/or a stronger villain who flicks them aside instead of finishing them off.
*SPOILERS BELOW*
Infinity War's ending moved me at least a bit, despite Ironman's ""acting"" and me being sadly certain of them reversing it anyway(oh boy did I hope I was wrong...). In Endgame, the supposedly moving events are permanent and I felt nothing. The ""epic"" battle was such a mockery that I just stopped caring. It's not that almighty universe-moving stones are now finger-snapping toys that every human can safely hold - as long he looks good and carries a bow. Not even that young Thanos is suddenly unstoppable even without the stones, even against Marvel.
It's the whole dumb scene good army vs bad army, it's the asgard chick I didn't care about even in Thor 3, arriving on a damn pegassus, it's Pepper in armor. And no matter how impotent Captain America feels throwing a shield around, the hammer? For the love of Stan, WHY?It could've been a good movie, just reduce it by 1 hour by cutting final battle to 15 min and emo scene to 5, oh well, maybe I'm the weirdo..."
2110,Great movie But not better then infinity war. Ending was the best part of it
2111,"Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie, but it feels like one. Every character get an end to their arcs, and the film itself is a great conclusion to 11 years of movies, all of which have led up to this. I wont spoil the actual plot for those who haven't seen it (the trailers have been incredible at not revealing anaything), but I will say that it is full of surprises, shocks, laughs and tears. The fact that the film manages to be THIS good more than makes up for its few flaws. The final battle is probably the most fan-pleasing, epic and emotionaly packed action sequence in any superhero movie; it was the culmiation if 11 years of characters we've come to love and care about. This is what superhero movies are all about."
2112,"An epic end to the this Infinity Saga..It couldn't have been any better..To all those fans around the globe who have been waiting for this moment. I have to say this is worth Ur wait, this is the moment, this is the Endgame"
2113,"A fitting way to launch the next phase of the Marvel Universe, so satisfying and the 3 hours disappeared in a blink of an eye.
Will definitely watch again in general release."
2114,"Just back from the theatre. Positioned myself beside the exit so I could slip out to the bathroom knowing it was just over three hours long, but so much was happening on the screen that I had to cross my legs. Exceptional ending to a fantastic decenium of action. There is no post credits which makes absolute sense so no need to sit through credits if you don't find it interesting."
2115,"This will go down as the best Marvel movie ever created. During the first hour it's like a pick up of where they left off in Infinity War, it's like shattered glass you don't even know where to start to put pieces back together,2nd hour it starts to get fun and exciting and it's like this is what we came here to do and we better make it worth it, bc we only have one shot.The last hour are the moments everyone has been waiting for, and the last final battle scene is the best action scene ever made. The people who made it deserve some type of an award for making something from a comic and putting it onto the big screen, I'm not even overrating it. All you heard in the theater was sniffles, it was absolutely breathtaking.SPOILER* (Do not continue reading if you don't want to know this)
Only negative OPINION I have is the Fact that Hulk was a total waste of character they definitely could've used him ALOT more. MCU has made hulk a JOKE. He didn't even fight. They need to just cancel his character, his character was a huge disappointment like really."
2116,"One can feel this is ending the MCU infinity age.
The movie feels like a the start of the movie is ""attack of the Clones"" and the ending is ""Return of the King"" worth to se but that's also about that. Not the Epic ending that was excepted."
2117,"OMG... I haven't have had such an experience watching a movie as it took me down memory lane like crazy. I was laughing, crying, in a loop and was lucky to watch the movie without any spoilers...So strongly urge everyone to not spoil the movie and let fans enjoy this amazing movie and culmination of last 11 years of marvellous MCU...Please don't listen to negative reviews, as they might be either from hard core DCU fans who can't see Marvel success. ;) or people who just expect a Schindler list from Marvel, though it comes close to some of the most amazing and great drama movies of all time.Nuff said, Fantastic movie..."
2118,"I'm a marvel fan and was so excited for this movie, even went for the first day first show but the movie disappointed me very much. I won't be wrong in saying thatthis movie is worst marvel movie.
It had no logic. First of all the concept of time travel was very childish and the story was unable ti explain he different timelines properly which resulted in many big flaws.
Just for instance the present nebula killed the past nebula. So my question is how the present nebula came into existence if there wasn't any nebula in the past?
This is just one of the example I'm mentioning, there are many of 'em.
So overall I'm not at all happy with the movie"
2119,"What a brilliant way to follow Infinity War. Actually, Let me look at it more vaguely. What a brilliant film. This superhero blockbuster is not the usual to say the least. Most emotions we feel day to day are heightened at certain points in the film, causing you to laugh out loud, whimper, clap, or cry. This is DC's ""the Dark Knight"". This is television's ""Game of Thrones."" This is the Endgame."
2120,"Absolutely FANTASTIC movie!! Very worthy end to a long cinematic history. Not often a movie gets this emotional, funny, exciting and heroic all rolled into one very refined roll.
The Russo brothers have done it! Absolutely blown away! From being corny now and then to an emotional rollercoaster right after that. A masterpiece!"
2121,"Every single marvel movie serves as a stepping stone to this very movie. This movie is complete on every aspect from the beginning to the end. Every Avenger plays a significant role that tells their story to the full. Filled with action, emotion, comedy and a great storyline, this movie will blow everyone away in 2019 and beyond.Thanks to Marvel and the Russo Brothers for making a movie that will make history in my personal books."
2122,"I like this movie too much. so delicate, so perfect, I cried several times, I have to watch it a few more times."
2123,"Worth it.
11 years and 21 movies later, the journey was an unforgettable one.
The emotions conveyed on my face have not done justice to this epic finale.
What are you sitting and reading this for ?
Go and watch the zenith of Marvel Comics come to life."
2124,"After seeing ENDGAME for the second time, I'm ready to write my review, which will be difficult to do without spoilers. I find it interesting that those who gave INFINITY WAR a 10 were disappointed in this movie and I think I know why (for I am one of them) - INFINITY WAR took so many characters, such different tones in the worlds of the different heroes, with such a big story arc, yet managed to tell real stories interweaving the larger story, not just 3 minute cameos. ENDGAME, although having real moments of pathos, missed that balance. Despite moments of humour (many at cost of Thor's character, which I didn't appreciate), this movie basically had one tone and I was disappointed how some of our heroes were marginalized (and given bad haircuts). I know it was the end of an era, a passing of the torch. As a friend put it, ""Character development was never the focus of this movie, that was what all the previous movies were for...it was a perfect wrap up and set up for the next arc."" I agree this was all about the ensemble but there were edits (or complete changes) to our heroes' journeys for which I didn't care (too many stories were left off screen) with one exception (Nebula has a character arc). So, that's why I didn't enjoy this as much as INFINITY WAR yet it was still a great movie with great performances by all the cast, poignant moments of loss, great montages in the battle scenes and a real challenge demanding great cost. Kudos to the Russos and Kevin Feige for their hands at the tiller for this era. I give this film an 8 (great) out of 10. {Superheroes Action Adventure}"
2125,"Infinity war was way better, in my opinion. There was a lot of plot holes in the movie to begin with. They had many cringe bathos moments and they crammed in too much emotional elements just to make the movie a n uplifting finale."
2126,"This is just my opinion, Infinity War was way better than this movie.Infinity War had a bunch of epic scenes throughout the whole 2.5 hours. Endgame was basically like a drama for the majority of the movie, but then it only got epic once all the Avengers reunited.Rest in peace Iron Man..."
2127,Love it marvel is doing truly great job i watch every marvel movie and i love all the movies of marvel it is full of action and comedy
2128,"This movie is perfection in modern cinema, great ending and gives great closure for the franchise."
2129,"When I first saw the 3 hour run time I was excited that we'd get an even bigger and greater story than Infinity War. I was wrong and wouldn't be surprised if this run time was only created to create more hype. Instead, we got plenty of pointless and boring scenes that add nothing to the characters or the universe. The first two hours are sleep inducing because there's a boring plot that I can't see anyone caring about. The last hour or so is the only part of the film that I'd want to see again, it's very much fan service but it was very fun to watch.Some other problems I had: The film doesn't even listen to its own rules of time travel when Captain America goes back with Peggy(I could be wrong about this though), Nebula was the only character that I felt any emotion for, instead of making an interesting and complex new story line after Thanos' death they just decided to have Thanos come back except this time he's the generic bad guy that wants to destroy the entire universe and create a new one(literally Cyrus from the ""Pokemon"" franchise), I believe the Hulk dabs, Thor yells at some kid on Fortnite(why was this even in the movie other than to just promote the game because they're having some stupid Endgame crossover event) and the ""first canonically gay character"" in the film was given disappointing and was shoved into the movie for a 2 minute scene that was pointless. I feel like the gay character was added to create more attention and to say ""wow, a gay character. we're so progressive, gay people come buy a ticket to see!""Overall, the movie was enjoyable. The first two hours may have been a drag but the final hour is very well deserved and is the best way the MCU could've ended. I've said this earlier that it's fan service but I don't see anything wrong with that because it's one hell of a fight. Seeing the Avengers group up made me jump in my seat and seeing the female Avengers charge together was also one of my favorite parts of the movie."
2130,Lazy plotline used(timetravel) a good climax but the rest was pretty boring. Only people who love the mcu would think this is an above average movie.
2131,"Pro:
Okay Action ScenesCons:
Pointless / Ineffective 'Emotional' scenesPointless / Ineffective HumourGender / Racial Pandering So Eager it gets awkward3 hrs of the above$300,000,000 million dollars spent on okay action scenes,A generally unengaging story."
2132,If I hadn't seen the IW this would be the best movie ever but my overall feeling is not the same as it was with IW. Some weird highlights : Tony hasn't got a badass Mk armor especially for Thanos. Fat Thor? Why drag it so far and made him look stupid and powerless?. Nerd Hulk had no altercation with Thanos. Captain Marvel great and powerful but just 2-3 scenes. A great and epic 11 years conclusion but something was missing. Can't really put my finger on it.
2133,After infinity and the captain marvel film I expected something amazing I was sadly disappointed with this mediocre action film. Sorry it was a bit boring a bit bland until the last 45 mins then it went turbo but even then it was all over the place and messy. Lots of nodding at each other I don't speak nod... Funny bits went a bit to far especially the Thor thing that got tiring. To me it was the T stark and C America show with their fat funny mate in tow and a few guest appearances on the side.
2134,"You've got to be a real fan boi to give this clunker a review score of 10. Without the few decent action sequences, this might have been the worst movie period. Somewhat dull from start to finish."
2135,"Let me start by saying that third act was brilliant but first two acts were just like fillers and was waste of good screenplay.
Secondly the time travel and save everyone was bad . Infinity war worked becouse it has simple linear storytelling .They could have just made the movie about Avengers finding whereabouts of Thanos and Thanos being driven mad with all the infinty power and now he wants to rule all planets to check the balance restored last epic battle between all Avengers and his new army which is created by mind controlling a powerful alien race . Firstly thor was god awful , his character was perfect before they turn him into a wimp. The End battle with all three would have been so much great if thor looked normal and What Infinity made great about thor this movie lacks.Even Hulk part was bad , his not able to turn hi self was so great in IW but EG just gave it away and made him permanent hulk just for sake of future movies. I wanted to love This movie but the real problems are bigger here. I know people will say this is the greatest movie they have ever seen but Infinty War was was better and best than everything this movie does."
2136,"One thing about time travel that no one seems to get.
The first Rule of time travel is:
You can not change anything in the past that lead to creating time travel in the first place.
Assuming that the Avengers didn't change any thing and the reason for creating the machine remaind the same
The big dramatic fight between the armies would not exist for 1 reason
if the Thanos and his team who came from the past died in the future after the 5 year mark the events that lead to creating the time machine disappear which means that they will not make the time machine and the whole branch will not happen
One more thing, where did the evil Army come from?
They were destroyed and scattered in the previous movie
Other than that every thing is perfect"
2137,The first part was much better. This one feels like a letdown!
2138,This film was hyped so much i couldn't wait to watch it....the film is good but i didnt get the wow factor i had when i watched infinity war.....all the trailers and the online leaks wasted the ending for me....i still love marvel movies and will go see every one that comes out but for me this was good but not as good as I/W
2139,"This movie is so close to be perfect!! sooo close!!! you will find some mistakes... some bigger than others... but in general, this movie is smart, visually amazing, will make's you laugh and cry...So... SPOILERS?!The movie start showing you what happens to some of the characters, some people find this part ""slow""... but for me was more than ok... Then... the preparation for the time travel and infinity stones heist start.This is the ""smart"" part... they found a way to use the stones in a way that don't affect the other movies, or at least that's what they try, for me this is the part they ""F""up things... there are some timeline nightmares after this movie!! things that affect characters in this movie, and even in the entire MCU.But apart from that, this movie deliver!! and deliver damn hard!!! the epicnes of the battle is ""a la"" Lord of the Rings"" but ""F""ing bigger!!! almost every character is here!! is like seeing ""Ready Player One""... everyone is on-screen and you don't want to blink your eyes, because you can loose something!More than one character will die... and those scenes are damn sad... if you are all-in in the MCU, you will cry!!!I give it a 9 just because the time travel mistakes, but more because Captain Marvel... omg... she's so powerful!! that is painful... marvel is going on a path that I don't want to go... I mean... I love Scarlet With, The Wasp is damn badass! even if she's just a human on a suit... but my favorite is Black Widow! just a regular human... no powers, no amazing gadgets... but Captain Marvel? she don't belong to the same universe... there is no logic's on why she's so powerful! and after investing more than 10 years on those characters, Captain Marvel feels more like Captain Mary Sue. THANKFULLY she don't do that much... but you can see how Mary Sue she is anyway.AMAZING MOVIE!!! the (almost) perfect way to close this incredible story... A MUST SEE!!!!!!!"
2140,"This movie is the best marvel have ever made.A 3 hour masterpiece , don't read the reviews just go see it ."
2141,"Man.. that was absolutely amazing.. well done.. i'm speechless, best movies ever.."
2142,"I have never given a 10/10 to a superhero film since the first Avengers film wayyy back in 2012. This movie is not perfect obviously (1. Some jokes fell flat and some of it i felt just appeared at the wrong time 2. Some songs i felt were placed or played at the wrong time too 3. Some people might have a problem with the pacing of the first act but i personally loved the slow pace), but this movie doesnt need to be perfect and there are obviously better superhero films in terms of quality like Captain America: Civil War, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Logan, The Dark Knight and so on but come on man. Those movies are great movies but Avengers: Endgame is magic/one-of-a-lifetime-event!Never have i once laughed, cried, cheered and screamed this much in a movie. I have also never thought i could get this much of a rewarding experience from rewatching all 21 MCU films. WOW! Thank you Marvel Studios for this experience!See it without any spoilers, i beg you!"
2143,"This film is the conclusion of the infinity saga series containing all 22 films for the past 10 years. Plotwise is great. It's a great storytelling. Few scenes are weird but acceptable. Marry Sue? Very few. OP? Just very few. It's reasonable and fun to watch every minutes. Nebula's arc is good and the actress is great. Every 6 main character's arcs including Ant-man are decent. There are shocks and twists but reasonable also. Characters from the past return and add very good additional contexts. The screenwriters, directors and producers made a good job. The CGI is good and realistic. The acting is world class. Many characters but they lifts up each other in the good way. Every actors are great.
I can see myself go back to watch it ten times, and I can do this all day.
Enjoy :)
I actually rate this movie 9.6/10, but lean towards 10."
2144,Sobbed. So much to take in. No words. Gonna watch it a millionth time more these few weeks.
2145,"Just came back from the movie theater after watching the movie. Not gonna give any spoilers or any kind of stuff that will ruin it for you after reading this. I'm just gonna say if you're a Marvel ultimate fanboy, a regular Marvel viewer, only watched Infinity War because of it's hype or just a normal movie goer that wants to watch an incredible movie it doesn't matter. This is in my opinion the pinnacle of cinema and I don't think I'm ever going to see a movie in the theaters ever again (except this movie again 2-3 more times). Just. Go. See. It."
2146,"I will keep this first part of the review short, but add some footnotes (indexed with <#> symbols) to a ""spoiler section"" below the trailer videofurther down. Proceed at your peril if you haven't yet seen it!The MCU has delivered an impressively well-connected movie series. In the case of Thanos, this is a story-arc that started in the mid-credit ""monkey"" at the end of 2012's ""The Avengers"" and, at the conclusion of ""Avengers: Infinity War"", saw half the universe's population drift away - Voldemort-style - into grey ash. This, of course, also wiped out half of our heroes. This included Spider-Man (Tom Holland); Dr Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch); Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman); Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson); half of the remaining Guardians; The Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) and Dr Pym (Michael Douglas). Oblivious to all of this is Ant Man (Paul Rudd), still stranded in the 'quantum realm' following the demise of his colleagues, and with no one to flick the 'return' switch.After some early action, Endgame's story revolves around a desperate attempt by the remaining Avengers, led by Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and a 'retired' Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) to undo the undoable. Can they succeed against all the odds? (With a new Spider-Man film due out in the summer, I'll give you a guess!). Of more relevance perhaps is whether the team can stay unscathed from their encounter with the scheming and massively powerful Thanos (Josh Brolin)?The film will not be to every fan's taste. After the virtually non-stop rip-roaring action of ""Infinity War"", ""Endgame"" takes a far more contemplative approach to its first hour.The film starts with a devastating prologue, and a great lesson in statistics: that you need a decent sized population to guarantee getting a 50:50 split! There is also a very surprising twist in the first 15 minutes or so that I didn't see coming AT ALL.But then things settle down into a far more sombre section of the film: short on action; long on character development. The world is grieving for its loss, unable to move on past the non-stop counselling sessions that everyone is getting. This first hour was, for me, by far, my favourite part of the film. Seeing how the characters we know and love have been impacted - some for better rather than for worse - was terrific. Mark Ruffalo's Hulk (with a rather glib plot-point) takes on an hilarious new aspect; and Chris Hemsworth adds hugely comedic value as Thor, setting up in Scotland a ""New Asgard"" settlement in uncharacteristically laid-back fashion.As an ensemble cast, everyone plays their parts extremely well. But it is just the breadth of the cast that astounds in this film: just about everyone who is anyone in the Marvel Universe - at least, those who are still alive (alive!) and not dead (dead!) - pop up for an appearance! This is great fun with, in one particular case, the opportunity to try some more rejuvenation of an old timer as previously done with Samuel L. Jackson in ""Captain Marvel"".Inevitably, some of these appearances are overly brief, and characters that I wanted to see developed more in this film (particularly Brie Larson's Captain Marvel) get very little screen time. Drax (Dave Bautista) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) barely get a single line each. So it will depend on where your loyalties lie as to whether you are satisfied with the coverage or not. (I personally find Chris Evans' Captain America a bit of a po-faced bore, so I wasn't keen on the amount of screen time he had).Stan Lee again gets another cameo in the bag before his demise: will this actually be his last live one?Overall, I enjoyed this movie. It could obviously NEVER live up to the over-hyped expectations of the fan base. But as a cinematic spectacle, for me, it delivered on its billing as a blockbuster finale, but one filled with a degree of nuance I was not expecting. The problem with the way that the plot have been structured (no spoilers - <#>) is that it is easy to pick holes in the storyline. Indeed, some dramatic options (that to me seemed obvious ones to 'mine') were left 'unmined' <##>; others were left inexplicably hanging <###>.I suspect the reason for some of this is that the initial cut of this film probably ran to 5 hours rather than the - still bladder-testing - 3 hours as released. There were probably a bunch of scenes left on the cutting room floor that might allow things to make more sense in the extended BluRay release.It's at times slow, but for me never dull. It does suffer from one significant flaw though: the ""Return of the King"" disease. It doesn't know when to quit. There was a natural MCU arc to follow and a perfect time at which to end it: but the directors (the Russo Brothers, Anthony Russo and Joe Russo) kept adding additional scenes that detracted from the natural ending <####>.Above all, unlike I think all but one film in MCU history, there is NO ""MONKEY"" (end-credit scene) in the end credits: either mid-credit or end-credit! So, after the long title crawl (and some rather odd choices for end-title music by Alan Silvestri), if you are not to look bloody stupid as the lights come up, and face a storm of derision from your partner, then leave after the dramatic roll-call sequence of the film's stars!******SPOILER SECTION*****
Do not read beyond this point if you've not watched the film!<#>
The ""plot-hole picking"" business I referenced is of course the time-travelling element of the plot. First up, Stark's discovery of the mobius strip McGuffin is nicely done and his moral torment at disrupting the idyllic life he's built is relatable. But this timey-wimey stuff tends to play havoc with logic.....<##>
The missed opportunity I saw was the killing of Nebula (the younger) by Nebula (the elder) (both Karen Gillan). If it had been the other way round, I *might* have understood it. But surely this way round, Nebula the elder would have ceased to exist to go back in time in the first place? That's obviously a paradox! It would at least have been more satisfying if Nebula the elder had ""ashed"" away or something: literally a self-sacrifice for the greater good. Perhaps I've missed something and need to watch it again!<###>
My other question would be what happened to her sister Gamora? She was alive and kicking (hard) in one scene, but then not mentioned further: just a pining Star Lord (Chris Pratt) looking at her picture? Again, maybe I missed something!What was particularly joyous was seeing a plethora of great faces on the screen: Rene Russo (no immediate relation to the directors!) as Thor's mother; Natalie Portman, reprising her role of Jane Porter from the first Thor films (so brief, it was clearly constructed from cut footage or something); Michael Douglas, old and young, as Dr Pym and particularly Robert Redford. (So THIS, not ""The Old Man and the Gun"", is his ""final film"" then!!?)My previous reservations (from ""Captain Marvel"") about the superior fire-power of Captain Marvel also held true. Although she had ""all the other planets"" around the universe to cater for (""Fair point""), when she did turn up she ripped through Thanos's ship like paper (as she did in her own film). And yet she couldn't rip her way through Thanos? And a stone-less Thanos at that!This really made no sense to me. In ""Infinity War"" you could rationalise that the REASON the combined efforts of The Avengers to attack and remove the glove of Thanos failed was BECAUSE he was immensely powerful by having four of the five stones. In the battle scene in ""Endgame"" he had the better of Stark, Thor, Captain America AND Marvel but without any stones in his possession. Or have I missed something yet again here?<####>
My view of the finale was that it should have ended with the (rather CGI'd) funeral pan round the assembled characters (including a few randoms... I understand the young teen on his own was the kid who helped Stark in ""Iron Man Three""). While the Captain America time travelling piece that followed was sweet and all, it's been done before (in Mel Gibson's ""Forever Young"" for example) and for me wasn't worth the minutes invested in it at the end of an already long film.So, where will we go from here then in the MCU universe? Stan Lee is dead; Stark is dead; Black Widow is dead (though - as Amy Andrews points out, in her excellent review of the movie - she's been criminally underused). There will no doubt be further MCU films: ""SpiderMan: Far From Home"" opens in the summer; surely we are due ""Black Panther"" and ""Captain Marvel"" follow-ups; ; and Ant-Man and the Wasp have barely scratched the surface together. But will we ever get to see another ""Avengers-style"" story arc that traverses and connects the characters again in a similar way? Only the timey-wimey stuff will tell.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)"
2147,Thank you for making us happy and satisfied. It's worth waiting for. 🍻
2148,This movie was great. Got a hummer when Thor showed up. Would recommend.
2149,"Spectacular, Emotional, Joyful, Unexpected, Filled with Actions.. Avengers Endgame is lifetime achievement.. It's the conclusion of 22 films.. It's like end of an era.. So please watch it in Imax or 3D and don't spoil the movie.. You'll enjoy it very much.. The ending is very satisfying.."
2150,"After 11 years and 22 movies, Marvel Studios brought us the most ambitious movie, the greatest culmination, it is nostalgic, sentimental and completely unexpected. All the characters are so well-balanced, to each one is given plenty of screen time to development. If you're a marvel fan you'll feel like you're finally complete, you've never seen anything like this before, there are many references to all the 22 movies and there is a certain inevitability about the plot, there are plenty surprises. The movie present us an incredible balancing between nostalgia and novelty, you will scream, laugh and cry, it is the Marvel recipe elevated to the highest level. There's just so much in it, that I can't even write about it without spoiling everything. This is not the end for Marvel, but it certainly marks an ending for several of the characters we've watched and loved over the last decade, there will be more superhero franchises but it's hard to imagine any one being so culturally resonant.
It is the grande finale."
2151,"Without second thoughts I would say that it wad the most impressive work for Marvel.. makes you feel sad, happy, excited and thrilled to the max all in one movie"
2152,"This movie is tree hours of superhero p*rn. Nothing more. And there is Infinity war.... I gave it 6 stars only because it is nicely made.
But.
Let's tart with Thanos' plan. The guy is obviously not educated. He wants to solve the problem of the universe by wiping out half of the population. Which would solve nothing. For example Earth's population was 3.6 billion in 1970, and it was 7.3 billion in 2015. So it needs only 45 years to go back where Thanos ""solved"" its problem. Why hasn't he changed the world to be sustainable???
And when the Avengers have the stones what do they do? They just restore everything. No plan beyond. They have the ultimate power to make the world better, but they do nothing.
And then the whole Endgame could have ended sooner: when the Avengers finally have the stones, why do they wait to wipe out Thanos and his army? Why running around absolutely uselessly while risking loosing the stones???
I agree with those who says superhero movies are not worth it, and they are not even proper movies. I know none that is logical enough and not about fighting and spectacular screens only. They are professionally made B category films..."
2153,This movie was so bad they had to screw up on the hulk worse than infinity war
2154,"I really liked this movie, but the plot holes. Wayyy too many plot holes and basically... with time travel unlocked they can do whatever now. Like, come on. Good idea but the execution was pretty awful. I still love the movie but I hate the billions of plot holes."
2155,"Captain McFly and Doc Emmett Bannner travel back in time to undo history but unfortunately Thanos Tannen finds out about the time travel shenanigans and manages to use time travel himself to his advantage.I'm a massive fan of time travel movies but this just seems to be a tacked on plot device to suck more dough from the fans.Lots of explosions and CGI. Pretty to watch, but that was about it.Should've ended with Infinity War."
2156,Never thought that a superhero movie could make me as emotional as this one did. RDJ's turn as IronMan was brilliant. To see the character develop from the first IronMan movie to this iteration was a journey well worth taking. And to have the story wrap up with all the characters and plot lines coming together was mind-blowing. A modern classic that sucks you in from the word go.
2157,"I saw this in the theater, It was awesome, and just when you think it can't any better it does..."
2158,No Negative reviews.. This is one of my most favourite movies of 2019
2159,"Endgame is an amazing culmination of 11 years of Marvel movies, leading to an epic battle. The acting, CGI, and plot are on point. It was also great to have references from previous movies, showing that all of the MCU is connected.I fully recommend, but do watch the previous movies to understand context, characters, and the story in general."
2160,"Just saw it for the second time. Actually worse than I remember.
Still a bit frustrated over how ""Hulk-situation"" turned out, as in no endgame fight with Thanos :-/
Too many jokes. It's not a comedy.
Too long.
Too much 'girl power'....and yeaahhh I know we live in that time were girls has to be as good as men, and were Superman and the little mermaid has to be black...but still!!Anyway. I downgraded my rating. The movie doesn't deserve a higher overall rating than 7/10"
2161,"So the film has a good pace that keeps me interested up-to the point when Thanos has won and retired to a planet far away (the first reality) ... then the avengers travel back in time and Thanos realises his plan will go well ... but here comes the first weakness in story ... if Thanos had all the stones ... knowing that the first snap didn't kill all the avengers, in all his wisdom and knowledge, he must have seen the possibility that there will be a counter attack, using the time stone to see this!And if he had seen this and known that he will be killed he would have ... yes ... destroyed the stones as he says ... and that is a great thing ... but ... still he would have known that past his death ... the Avengers will travel back in time and get the stones again, snapped back everyone into existence again and killed him for second time in the present time ... he would have known thisBut when I saw this film, Thanos was deliberately limited in ability even when having all the stones in his possession to make the avengers win ... which is very wrong.Second Weakness ... If Doctor Strange only saw one possibility of winning this, so would Thanos see that too and found a way to secure his goal. There is no way you can have all the stones in your hand and still not see the whole future ahead of you. Thanos would have known everything about the happen after the first snap, you just don't retire knowing your plan will fail ...This ""reality"" is very bare and I don't understand why it wasn't dealt with in the film ... this made me honestly dislike the film, the first one (infinity war) had great plot points, but this was majorly lacking due to what I have written about.I honestly felt like giving it a 3/10, infinity war I gave it a 9/10"
2162,"Anthony and Joe Russo created an incredible ending to this phase of the Marvel universe. Having seen all 22 movies to date since the first Iron Man, I feel like the Marvel universe has had its ups and downs, but in the past couple of years has cracked the secret to making each movie better than the last one.Each character had an ample amount of time on screen for development without dragging on too long (I know it's 3 hours long but honestly, I could have sat there for 4 hours as I enjoyed every minute of it). It was emotional and I know when I saw it the day it came out, there were people sobbing when Tony died. I didn't feel so crushed by the ending, but it was definitely sad."
2163,Avengers: Endgame is the best and most perfect movie of Marvel's cinematic universe.
2164,One word review masterpiece. Can't explain or give further . Its beyond reviewing. Speechless. A must watch .
2165,"Infinity was was better than end game.
what you have done with thor is not good"
2166,"It's really not amazing - if really is flawed hugely.......none of the plot makes any sense and it has ruined future marvel movies with its awful writing......I don't understand people who have given it such a high score.
If you truly step away and think about it the flaws, plot holes and disregard for future and old marvel movies - you kinda can see what a bad movie it is!
My advice go read the comics - they are so much better than any marvel movie!Marvel have only had 2 or 3 really good movies - and about 18ish standard or awful movies......I hope they reboot the entire universe- which I'm guessing they are gonna do because of how they have messed everything up in this movie!"
2167,"First of all...... I must clarify that I'm not Biased towards any production. I like superhero movies and I enjoy watching them. But above all...... What's most important for me is the storyline of the movie and the absolute justification of the story portrayed. No doubt Endgame was the most awaited and most ambitious project for MCU and the fans....... Maybe that's why it went from ""great+5"" to ""disappointing-6"" by the end of the movie.**SPOILERS**The story had the most simple and obvious start to the story with Captain Marvel bringing Tony Stark and Nebula to Earth. And they rushed in showing that....... The rescue went on so quickly that it couldn't create a sense of excitement and suspense of how Tony Stark reaches Earth after being stranded mid-space..... Thus wasting all the hype created by the first Endgame Trailer.Then, just like that, they went to get Thanos at another planet and Thor finally goes for the Head...... Done...... Accepted...... And that's the end of Captain Marvel's hype created at the end of Infinity War and in Captain Marvel.Now, Avengers are broken and living quietly trying to recover from the losses...... Done...... Agreed...... Too much to take....... But why make Thor a Santa Clause.....? That was the most rated character to take on Thanos one on one........ But he was used as a Comedian in the whole movie, Drunk and Fat. Stormbreaker for opening Beer Bottles..??? Hilarious and Disappointing.Coming to Hulk, or Professor Hulk........ Good character..... And equally powerful to take on Thanos.......but he was buried all the time under the debris....... That's where the character got wasted. No proper use of an important character.Clint and Natasha....... Ok......
Went on Vormir...... One sacrifices life to get the stone...... Ok...... Accepted....... That was the only thing Black Widow had to do in movie...... Atleast they used Clint Barton in a proper way this time.Scott Lang all of a sudden becomes a science genius who talks about Time Travel and Quantum Physics. And seriously....... A mouse rescues Antman from Quantum Realm...??No words for Thanos, Steve Rogers and Tony Stark because these three were the only ones who got proper screen time and focus.But Time Travel and Timelines...? They hell lot messed it up despite saying they'll restore it after everything is over. Cmon..., Thanos and his Army came from past to the present and Died. That means New York, Ultron, Civil War, Infinity War and all of it....... That must not happen at all....... And how did they restore the Tesseract and Sceptre after using the Stones, to put it back in the past........And it seems there were two Steve Rogers all this time, since the present one went back and stayed. Again.... Sentimental touch......And why create an emotional drama by killing Tony Stark....... The character on which the whole MCU is dependent........ Could have easily retired him to a quiet life in the woods........The final Battle is the only thing that looked worthwhile with the exceptions of lesser Thor and Hulk vs Thanos....... And now out of nowhere Captain Marvel comes back to take some credits and lead the girls gang of MCU........Dr. Strange gets special appearanceIts just an entertainer for the MCU Fans....... But if you try finding logic in the storyline....... I think you'll be just as confused as I was after watching the movie. Go for it to complete the MCU journey and 3D Action Experience. Its still a long way to beat ""The Dark Knight Trilogy"""
2168,"I've grown up with the MCU with Iron Man coming out when I was 5 years old. I love this series and it's sad that the main saga is over but I expected a bit more. I gave Infinity War a 9/10 because of its amazing pace, fun characters and unexpected gut-wrenching ending, but this film has sluggish and inconsistent pacing, ruined character arcs (like Hulk as in IW he was afraid to even show himself but now they sorted everything out... Off screen), and a very predictable story and ending. I'm not even joking when I say that (even though my prediction was slightly different) my prediction to the film was extremely accurate to the films events.To conclude, I watched Infinity War 3 times in cinemas and who knows how many times on Blu-Ray, but I've only seen Endgame once and have no intention of seeing it again anytime soon: I liked it, but was overall disappointed."
2169,"Spoilers follow...
As somebody who has watched and enjoyed superhero movies since the first Superman movies starring Christopher Reeve, Dark Knight Trilogy, all the way to the first Avengers this movie does not live up to A-grade standards.First the good:
1. Impressive visual effects
2. Great acting by Robert Downey and the entire castThe bad:
1. The solution to their woes--time travels seems like an idea from Harry Potter rather rather than a superhero movie. Instead of what it was supposed to be ...super heroes working together to intelligently plan and execute a way to beat Thanos...against all odds....with the risk of certain death, what we have as a solution is.... to go back in time and avoid facing Thanos altogether. How unheroic! And what a convenient device to avoid solving the problem created in Infinity War! With this precedent we should not believe that any superhero can die, since it will be possible to correct any death by time travel with the effort of the flick of a switch. Didn't know being a superhero could be so easy!2. Is this supposed to be a war? How is it that we have a record number of heroes/aliens/explosions in this ""war"" and yet not a single casuality...or barely a scratch on the good side. Are these aliens totally inept? And if by some miracle any of these heroes actually dies...no problem...you can always go back in time and voila!...problem solved. By the way, the unnatural way Iron Man died does not count because Robert Downey is clearly tired of this role, and just like Harrison Ford in Force Awakens, probably just asked to be killed off abruptly. Let me bet that if Robert Downey was willing to continue, no way will they kill this money maker!So in conclusion, while this movie is supposed to be a superhero war movie, the magical use of time travel to solve all the world's ills is not the kind of short cut instant formula solution that make good movies. The fact that they have a war with no casualties on the ""good"" side confirms the bad storytelling of this very long big budget movie. Perhaps Disney can focus less on selling more toys and have a story with more realism that follows natures laws."
2170,"I've never been a super fan of Superhero movies. Having said that have seen most of the marvel films. The one takeaway from Avengers Endgame is that it is an extremely ambitious piece of film making. It's unusual that so many of the actors and artists who many people have come to idolize over the years should come together in a film.The film starts five years after Infinity Wars ended. Not going to include any spoilers, but there's a good part of the opening half of the film spent looking into the devastating consequences of Infinity Wars which are very script/character driven. Not surprisingly the second half of the film is very much action based and the 3 hours running time fairly fizzes along. Although it isn't perfect Endgame is definitely one of the best Superhero movies I've watched and lived up to expectations."
2171,"I really do understand why it should have some emotional sides in this movie but I really don't understand why did they decide to put too much. It was way too much and made it boring especially in the first half of the movie.Ruined the last movie logic in some ways. First of all, in the last Avengers movie, at the last scene, Captain Marvel was called. Why did they put this scene in the last movie if they decided to give her the least role? It made no sense. The tension in the last movie was balanced but in Endgame there was no balance. One scene doesn't fit second one as it started losing it's consistency.Alright, it's not the worst Avengers movie but way worse than the last one. Is there any explanation of all those scientific stuff they made up? If you want to make a good movie of superheroes, I guess you should not use pseudoscience or very weak scientific arguements. They shouldn't mention those scientific arguements in the movie. It would be better without those weird explanations. If there were cuts around 1.5 hours of movie, it would easily get over 7 points from me but I felt like this movie took my time without any sense.Cheap tricks... I wonder why they used time travel idea in this movie and why did they say Black Widow had faced permanent death while Gamora had return from another time. Why did infinity stones didn't remain after Thanos used them to kill half of the livings but after Hulk revived all the dead people and Iron Man used them to kill all the enemies. This was very unclear."
2172,I would agree with critics saying its a bit too hyped and overrated movie.Doesnt live upto my expectations. Sorry
2173,"After Infinity War I was waiting for marvelous final in End Game, but Marvel surprised me in negative way. They finished one the greatest franchise ever as drama and tragedy. They added so many dialogues that some people has been falling asleep.
After dynamical Infinity War they gave us a so slow motion film. And finally, that what they did with Captain America it's a disaster for time theory!"
2174,"Why did she cut her hair in the middle of the movie?Positives
it's the last onesome of the actionhumorNegatives
re hashed plots (time travel, big battle)extremely predictabletoo long-enemies became as tough as butterMore of a cash grab for ""cult fans"" If you watched this movie like I did only seeing infinity war and a handful of other marvel movies , you would think it's not a great movie at all. Good popcorn muncher flick though."
2175,"Hulk? Barely fought and not even a rematch between him and Thanos
The villains? Killed without breaking a sweat even though they were near invincible in Infinity War
Thor? As an obese? Nah. Not working.
Thanos himself? Just a super villain. You didn't have any sympathy for him as you did in Infinity War. His whole character was goneLastly, much of the humor was low-grade.. infinity war is by far the best og the 4 movies"
2176,"I don't wanna spoil. honestly don't get over hyped. its not 10 star or 9. it deserves 8
Made for Marvel fans
Not good as Infinity war but not bad for 3 hours
Hilarious Thor! :D"
2177,I was very excited for this movie but i was a bit disappointed. Didn't do justice to hulk. We don't see him in action and no character development for how he became professor hulk and not satisfied with treatment to Thor as he was fat in movie. Overall was entertaining to watch.
2178,"Dear, dear directors,Please stay away from time travel in your movies. It is guaranteed that the consistency of your story line is fraud. Always.Don't get me wrong: I liked this movie. I really did. But one can't help thinking all kind of scenarios as to: what if?Avengers Endgame seriously defers from all different time movies. An older Nebula kills a younger version of herself. There's a reason why all other time movies ever made consider this impossible... because of some logic in timelines.OK, so in Endgame the theory is that time lines are not connected. You can go back in time, mess the timeline up as far as killing your younger self and still return to your own future like nothing happened. I think it's a kinda lame way to look at time travel, but OK, theoretically possible.But then explain this to me: in the end, Captain America travels back to put all the infinity stones back in their timelines. He does not return using the time machine, but still ends up in the actual timeline as an old man. I'm sorry, but that is inconsistent.Another inconsistency, unavoidable by all time travel movies... how far back do you actually have to travel to meet your own self? It's pretty common to travel back years and find a younger version of yourself. But what if you travel back just one second... will there be two versions of you for the rest of your time line?Time travel is just messy. I don't even want to start about all the time lines that get messed up by Endgame: no Age of Ultron, no Vision, no Scarlet Witch, etc.The last comment I have on this movie is the inconsistency of the power that these superheroes have. In Infinity War, Thor beats up Thanos even when Thanos has all the infinity stones. Iron Man fights Thanos better on Titan than in Endgame on earth. Seriously, without any infinity stones Thanos beats Captain America, Iron Man, Thor and later Captain Marvel who basically flies through armored ships... but can't flight straight through Thanos.I might be over analyzing, I know.Last mayor inconsistency: Thanos is able to get hundreds of people from 2012 to present day using the time machine. The Avengers don't even consider this option... they need to get all infinity stones first to undo the snap. Might it be an idea to bring back about 10-20 key people first and THEN go after the stones?Oh, and nobody got the idea at the end of the movie to ask Captain America, who was going back anyways to put the stones back in their timelines, to bring a version of Natasha, Tony and Vision back with him? I mean... this worked for Gamorra.... she is the version of another timeline...Conclusion: time travel messes up story lines BIG time. Please stay away from them. Find other means to turn things around...Thanks for reading."
2179,"The first half of the movie have some slow and boring scenes, not an end game type movie, missing action and the power start, the second half and the last 40 minutes marvels best, can watch multiple times only for thanos"
2180,"First off what is it with Disney making everything so generic and bland. Sorry but you have a franchise so big with so many characters that ""vanished"" and what do you do with them... well not to give it away but Cher's song comes to mind, why because that's the only thing you can do silly! The only problem with it is it takes the non vanished ones like 45 minutes to figure this out. The rest of the movie is spend getting the stones with of course the epic battle in the end. I don't have a problem with this as it is a typical big budget movie that will probably break even more records through the course of time, or at least until the next big movie comes up in this crowded theaters. What I liked was the part of Thanos and his daughters, yes it slowed the pacing down a dat but it was emotional and meaningful. I also liked the humor, except for the Hulk being half Banner and half Hulk... it's like the executive is ok just throwing out what it means to be these various characters. The ending was also sad saying goodbye to some of the characters... some died others passed the torch to other ones which is where I have a problem. Sorry but for some it's regrettable to have a character be replaced since they really didn't need to (Captain America living a full life only to return a old man and passing the torch... with more of those red viles needed to turn back time couldn't he just go back in time again and remain CA?) all I can think of why they would do this is for being PC and/or to save Disney 20 million bucks a picture. There were other PC moments in the film, like in the epic battle there has to be a girl power moment out of the blue and it goes nowhere ... once again it's fine just too obvious. It's not a bad movie but also not worth the universal praise it is receiving either. I like the marvel movies and this one is no exception. The story just needed a bit more than turning back time and finding the stones. There are a lot of what happens next in the next films and I hope they do other things with Marvel post Stan Lee."
2181,"After a decade, finally came the conclusion of the Avengers and in the mere mortals we waited for so long, and this is the movie they deliver? I expected more. The Avengers Infinite War is a cool movie, however it is not perfect. But the Endgame ruin things with these facts:
1-They transformed Thor into a full fat drunk. And the end he deliver the throne to the valkyrie ... ridiculous.
2-The hulk teacher who does not fight sucks, I prefer a thousand times the hulk smash.
3-Secondary characters that really do not serve anything.
4-Thanos suddenly became a generic villain.
5-Several unnecessary scenes that did not need to be in the movie.
6-Time travel full of flaws.Those few good moments, for example the captain america's fight, iron man and Thor against Thanos. The CGI was good. The actors who played best were Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Scarlett Jonhansson. Most of the cast was ok, but some actors have performed median. The film could be epic, but the script and direction did not help. Despite this it is still an entertainment I give 5/10."
2182,"It wasn't bad, bu it's a simple action cliche, with humor, without drama or deep message. What special about infinity war, is the conflict. The villain is not all evil. He wants to create a better world for everyone to thrive. Infinity war ends with a dissonance, and many viewers, me included asked themselves - maybe he is right. Endgame starts with a simple answer - the world is a mess after Thanos actions. I think the world can thrive even with half of the population, but here right from the beginning the answer is simple. Endgame switched from the attempt to make the bad guy have deep character, into a clear message: ""Thanos is all bad"". Well this message continues through the entire movie, and I hate the fact they ruined the deep complex villain character, with a ""want to destroy all, including his comrades "" boring villain."
2183,"I wanted this movie to be good, no great. But it just wasn't. Plot holes galore, needless scenes, and terrible pacing riddle this movie like buckshot. I so wanted this movie to be good that I went back to see it again. And as I sit here with my Captain America t shirt still on from the night before, I feel the need to vent some honest nerd rage.First and foremost, time travel is the biggest, dumbest McGuffin (a tool you use to forward the plot) ever. For one thing it's tricky, you don't want paradoxes and you to mess with the time stream continuem. But they did. The movie opens with Thanos, who is at this point the most powerful, knowledgeable person in exsistence. So he destroys the stones so no one can undo what he's done. Well, if you had all the infinity stones you would be aware of multiple timelines and universes and destroying the gems in this timeline is utterly futile. And while we are taking about Thanos, he is way more one dimensional and dumbed down than he was in ""Infinity War"".Secondly, time travel!! Captain America goes back and encounters his past self. Past Cap says that it's Loki but when their shields collide, Past Cap should realize something is afoot. If it was Loki, the illusion should have shattered, yet both shields rebound after impact and fall into the abyss. When did Future Cap get his shield back and if he didn't, wouldn't we have a Past Cap moving forward with 2 shields. Again, time travel is a tricky thing.Thirdly, didn't Doctor Strange have the time stone the entire time?! He could have went back and changed any number of possibilities. I suppose by oath he was barred from using it even if it meant saving half the universe.I'm going to stop counting at this point.But hey, don't give the gauntlet to the only god you have on the team because he's been drinking for five years. No give it to Robert Downy Jr. because he's tired of being Iron Man and that makes sense. Also, how many times do you need to snap the gauntlet?! One to bring everyone back and another to dust Thanos? Why couldn't have been one snap? (Answer: contract negotiations)Did the Hulk smash anything other than keys on a keyboard?And finally, no after credit anything????? I mean, if you count your average comic book fan, at matinee prices we spent on average $220 just to see this in theatres, not including dvds, blu rays, and other merch. The very least you could've done was a thank you for watching or in the infamous words of Stan Lee ""Nuff said""."
2184,"The premise is good, the idea and concept are great, all the materials are historically foretold, but they put too many side stories on screen and making the movie too much about nothing important. This movie started to become alive again once the battle started.I would suggest a 30-to-40-minute cut would be great and release this theatrical version as extended version on BluRay would be better. If DCs BvS and Justice League required extended story scenes, this has way too many unnecessary scenes.However, I'm glad they ended it, however they don't have the ""WOW"" (shocking/surprising/exciting climatic) moments that usually ended a long sagas. Instead, they have a throwdown battle. At least the dramatic ending was 'proper' for retiring old celebrated heroes of the series."
2185,"Pros:
top notch cinematic, over the top action, nice concept of time travel.Cons:
chaotic scenes with so many characters, forced cringe moments."
2186,"This movie was great for what it was. A closing of the book that is the MCU's first 10 years. It isn't going to satisfy everyone. It had funny moments, it had touching moments, it had moments of dread and desperation. Character development and closing of their arcs is far more important than visual appeal and action. Especially when you have to allow beloved characters to pass on the torch to the future of the MCU. People need to wait until explanations about certain decisions in the movie come to light. When people have watched the movie again and watched the director commentary along with it, then you can give a meaningful review."
2187,"After watching Avengers: Endgame, I didn't like how the remaining Avengers came up with the way to solve the crisis. I was like ""What?! Is it that simple to do that?"", ""Huh?! How did they knows where to look for them or when to come to help?""Antman, Iron Man, Cap, ""Rabbit"", and Natasha didn't disappoint me at all. They were great. Love to watch those scenes with these characters.Thor is like a clown since Ragnarok.Fighting scenes were alright but some were too shaky. I don't like the shaky fighting scenes. Nauseating!Thanos and Hulks' CGI look like Shrek CGI. I can understand it's not an easy job to make it perfect so I'm alright with the CGI.Music is alright. I don't hate it but i don't love itThere were some parts of the movie that i I feel like skipping.Overall, it's not the best movie I'd ever watched but it's not a bad movie."
2188,"The movie left me shocked, and astonished. Great movie, Best Marvel movie by a long shot. Wow, just Wow."
2189,"Go ahead and watch the trailers for Avengers: Endgame, they won't give anything major away. It's amazing for a huge movie to be so self-aware of itself, as well as, the movie genres that they're overtly borrowing from. The minor characters or those not even in Avengers: Infinity War, step up and help set up huge sequences that are highly entertaining and actually answer questions. Avengers: Endgame acknowledges every aspect of the characters emotions in their previous MCU film's and succeeds in the most Meta way possible.Ant-Man is a major reason for this. It's no spoiler to say that he's in the film as he produces some of the biggest laughs from the trailer of him ringing the bell at the Avenger's front gate. It's Paul Rudd's wry jokes, quick timing and fish out of water facial expressions that really assist things.The pacing of Avengers: Endgame is amazing and not for the reasons you might think. It's brilliantly paced, but it throws the entire formula and how MCU films are done on their head. Battle, loss, battle, loss, humor and then victory, take those ingredients, shake well and you've got a loose description of some average superhero films.If Avengers: Infinity War left you feeling betrayed and bummed out, I feel you. Avengers: Endgame more than makes up for any ill feelings that it caused. I see why they played it the way they did, and doing so any other way would've cheapened the film, watered down the MCU and made it all disposable. It is also worth noting that the film balance lots of humor with the drama, all the while putting it in a nice bow with stones.What we're left with is a 10 year opus that spans more arcs than Lord of the Rings and encapsulates it all in a perfect manner. Granted, they will still make many MCU films, this is not their swan song. However, there is a victory lap feeling about Avengers: Endgame. It respects the fans, adds to the dramatic elements, answers questions that fans have wondered about and plants a couple new seeds to grow on.Is Avengers: Endgame OK for children? If your child has seen any MCU film then they'll be OK with this. The film has fair number of bad words, but the violence is on par with what younger fans are accustomed to. For example, there isn't any one instance that's as graphic as when the monster ate the businessman in Shazam!, but there are sustained action sequences that might test those 8 years old who haven't seen an MCU movie before."
2190,"The trailers to this film are completely misleading. It painted a bleak, inevitable outcome for the surviving heroes after Thanos's devastating snap that left the whole universe in ruins.It goes into a completely different direction than I originally expected. For one thing, it's much funnier than I thought.
It's also nothing like Infinity War. It's basically a mix of many other marvel movies all wrapped into one epic heist film.Its lengthy time run does get a bit problematic at times, but by the time the climactic battle sequence comes by the end, you forget all about it. Those who had been disappointed or despondent by Infinity War will rejoice when seeing this one.The film is a true testament to sacrifice, love and loss. Obviously I laughed, I cried and I clapped. This is truly cinematic history."
2191,"First of all I would like to thank all of these marvel movies.
second, thank all the actors.
Producers, writers.Thank you so much for everything, this movie was awesome for marvel ending. in my opinion I found few ""forced"" things but it had to be that way because it was the last movie. I believe that this movie will be remembered forever, the question of some things being different in the HQ and in the movie I believe I have been a bit disappointed. but anyway, thanks for making this available to all fans!In Memory of Stan Lee! (1922 - 2018)"
2192,"Messed Up The Whole Timeline, Ruined Many MCU Characters, Thanos all of a sudden becomes such a bad guy after developing him so beautifully in Infinity War. Massive Plot Holes. PS - Bad Movie."
2193,"The tech side of this film is stunning. The acting is top notch but the story is convoluted... yes even for a comic book film....SPOILERS AHEADkilling black widow was the biggest risk this film took. Capt turning into the wielder of Thor's hammer was cool but predictable as was the demise of Tony. Hulk being soy hulk was annoying but definitely not a deal breaker and seeing some old favs was cool.Biggest problem was it felt like I could see what was going to happen 45 minutes before it did (with black widows death being the exception... I thought it would be Clint). I enjoyed to over the top end battle with a few exceptions... the femvengers being jammed throats was cringy as heck (I realize Disney pushes cultural marxism but that was pure cringe)... we love the characters for who they are, not gender. With that said, Iron pepper had my eyes rolling to the point I saw my feeble little mammal brain and inside of my nose...Good points: Tony dying and Capt (America, not the gender studies) getting to grow old. Not all endings need to be happy was something I truly agree within this film. Now I can put the MCU to rest for good... not great but good.P.S. seeing Thanos blast carol danvers to space was oddly satisfying"
2194,"I had very high hopes for this movie when it started at one minute past midnight on the day of release. It just took so long to get started (for me).
Now let me just say I LOVE MARVEL MOVIES I've seen them all at the cinema , I've bought all the DVD'S and I know that Endgame will be the last we'll see of certain stars in the MCU but this film was too long and in some parts downright depressing.
Captain Marvel did not get enough air time for me, neither did Black Widow and The Hulk looked a lot smaller than he did in Ragnarok, these are just some of my observations and I've many, many more.
The best part of the movie was the Battle at the end, it just a shame it took so long to get there."
2195,"I'm among those people, who normally don't engage in writing reviews. But this time I really have and want to. I rewatched the infinity-saga prior to Engame's release and there couldn't have been a better ending to it then the one it got. It really has been an epic ride and I feel privileged to have been able to be a part of it. Though only being a spectator, I feel connected to these characters, they are like long know friends. Endgame is the epic and monumental end to the saga which began over a decade ago. And oh it is more then worthy to be the last milestone on this incredible journey. I went through so many emotions watching this, joy, pride, happiness, sorrow and a sense of being alive and what it means to be human. Just watch it, you'll see what I mean, I really don't promise too much. It's truely hard to say goodbye to so many beloved characters, but they get the ending they deserve and will always be the franchise's core. Thank you for this amazing journey Marvel."
2196,"Time travel can't be done. what it cost if we use to create multiverse? endgame not explain it at all, what it cost of multiverse. I prefer time travel in x-men universe, that's more accepted."
2197,"Woah!...what can I say? This is the movie event of the year, if not this decade! It Caps (pardon the pun) of 11 years of MCU joy and sends some characters out with a bang! Literally EVERYONE thats ever been in a Marvel movie is in this thing.
It is absolutely hilarious in places, with standout comedy performances going to Thor and Hulk, who had me cracking up, Thor especially with his 'new look' lol
It was as I expected it to be for the first act, slow going and moody, with a massive sense of loss after the 'snap' with wiped out half the universe.
But you dont care, your just reeling from these characters who have lost so much, and feeling their pain. They lost big time! And they know it!
It's very unexpected in one aspect though, as you'll see, when they catch up with a certain villain very early on, and your like..woah..ok!?I'm not gonna harp on, just gonna say you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be thrilled and entertained for 3hrs and a minute. I need to go and see it at least twice more to fully take it in, as I'm still reeling from the midnight screening.Bravo to the Russo bros, I take my hat of to you both and say thank you for a movie event I'll remember for a long time to come. Take a bow guys, you deserve it soooo much."
2198,"This is not just movie, it's beyond movie. It's the one movie that doesn't required any review, recommendations or feedback. Best comic book movie ever. MASTERPIECE!
#endgame #dontspoiltheendgame"
2199,"I went into the cinema expecting to have at least as a great time as infinity war, but came out unimpressed. The path of restoring the stones took too long, time travel just too easy an escape to explain things, captian marvel just too powerful it's boring."
2200,"I was so excited for this movie just like so many others, but I was seriously underwhelmed throughout. People said there was a single 4 minute lull in the middle of the movie, however, it felt like a good majority of the movie was nothing but lulls and filler. I really hoped for this movie to be so good, but by the end I was left scratching my head. It was so disappointing, especially for a Marvel movie, and I felt very let down by the series that I've grown up with. There are many unresolved plot holes throughout the whole movie that leaves me wondering how it made it to production with plot holes and mistakes this bad. I believe there was lots of lousy, careless writing and production on account of the production team resting on their laurels of being Marvel and the hype of the movie. On top of all these mistakes, there were definitely points of politicizing gender bias at points where it didn't make sense to put it. Honestly, that was totally unnecessary and highly detracting from the already poorly made movie. I was also disappointed by the use, or better stated misuse, of characters, such as Captain Marvel. For all the hype that was brought up about her, I misunderstood all of it. I never saw her movie, and told it was unnecessary for the avengers timeline. After watching, it was correct. She was used in only two points as a deus ex machina and nothing else. Using a character, especially as powerful as she was for nothing but a deus ex machina is a very amateurish level of writing. It could've been so much better for an ending to the MCU story, but I was so let dow and keep wishing it were better."
2201,"He's right. Basically everything he wrote above. The movie was entertaining and well worth the time, but it doesn't deserve
a rating higher than decent.And oh.. don't pay for it. Free stream it. NEVER support the greedy milking ****s at Disney corp."
2202,"Pretty sure Robert Downey Jr got his lines wrong. What he clearly meant to say is back to the future is clearly a way better depiction of time travel. Long gone are the days where movies had real emotional empathy and believability, they must have got washed up in the shores of time. Great Scott, if only we could go back to when these film had tangible sets and characters with substance and weight. This movie begins where infinity war left off with half the population doing a disappearing act, involuntarily of course. Our main protagonist Iron Man is lost in space and somehow found out of nowhere with very little reason. The new kid on the block has a talent for picking out people from space with, with her arms, or so it would appear. Eat your heart out superman!! Yet we are willing to let most this go, the task of expanding the universe further seems exhausting enough. With a barrel load of character to tackle not even three hours can save this mess. Maybe because they have to stick to their Hollywood Marvel formula and get the routine thirty minute, am I watching a kid play Mortal Kombat? Battle scene in!! The only thing missing is the vintage finish him voice at the finale. Reminence of the battle scene in ""ready player one"" springs to mind. Don't misinterpret me I don't mind a well built up epic conclusion but unfortunate this felt like a reversal of what had already materialised in the previous outting. As far as character and acting goes our main bunch handled themselves to the usual standard. We had nice chemistry wisecracks and charisma throughout the film and with regards to pacing it's a little slow to start off with. It's a good thirty to forty five of we're getting the band back together!! Without giving too much away it is a very linear one dimension story but still packs a bit of a punch with some humour and emotion from time to time. With regards to empathy I felt more for the characters towards the end than in the early stages. I felt like they failed at the start where you should feel really sad for the friends they lost but they all seemed to have moved on five years on. Scarlett Johansson's character was the only one who made me feel like it had actually happened. Overall it was an average finish, nothing to go to mad about."
2203,I hate what they did with Thor. Thor is the only reason I have ever read comics. In the comics he was the epitome of honor and bravery. He is now a joke. Brakes my heart. And there is no turning back from this story line. Even if he turns around from this 5 years of weakness. I'll never look up to the MCU Thor like I did to the Comic book Thor.
2204,"Nothing is perfect, this movie is not perfect and yes it could have been better but it is a fitting conclusion to the Avengers saga and sad that we will not be some characters again in their super hero forms. There will be tears in the theaters so get ready. As for analyzing this movie, I recommend getting a PhD if you have to go into minute details. This is a movie and it will have plotholes, so enjoy it for what it is and the effort put into it.I watched this in IMAX yesterday and watching it again in Dolby in a few days with my family. Thank you to all the hard work put into this movie. Thank you Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, and many more.....my son was born in 2008 and you guys have served as an inspiration for us all. Thank you."
2205,"Don't even try to except anything when you go to see the movie because even if you will try super hard, there is no way you can guess what will happen. The movie has an amazing story, twists, fight scenes, and some really emotional scenes too.
It will give you everything you want to it to show you and even more.
So trust me, Do not waist and go watch this beautiful movie when you have a chance to."
2206,"The almost 3 hours flew by with great writing and effects, and the change of the characters lives made it that much more entertaining - especially Thor! Better than I expected, and a wee bit better than the last film imo. 9/10"
2207,"What an end to an epic series. A roller coaster of action, humour and emotions."
2208,"No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.So, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10. Comparing it with other blockbuster movies I could give it a 12/10, it's that good..."
2209,Good movie but a bit long especially during the 2nd phase (could skip 30min ez) and the end is not as epic as Infinity was last year...harcore fans will absolutly love it for sure for other it's just a good ending.
2210,"Avengers: Endgame
After the devastating events of Avengers: Infinity War (2018), the universe is in ruins. With the help of remaining allies, the Avengers assemble once more. After seen it hard to say but Marvel disappointed to not used their greatest villain in the endgame.
The film is about undo the ""SNAP"" that's it! Nothing else. For this, 3 hours is too long to do nothing. beginning of the movie (the Clint part) was so perfect and then couple of minutes was so fast I don't know why they'd cut so many scenes, completely unsatisfied.
The creation of aftermath was good. The middle part of the movie was boring cause they'd spend so much time on some unusual moments, funny moments in very serious situation, time travel plot holes, ruined the most valuable character Thor, Banner and Thanos. So, almost 2 hours I hadn't seen any villain I thought that marvel conclude Thanos's story but they didn't and also, they haven't used all the infinity stones individually. only they'd used for the ""SNAP"".
Last hour of the film. well first 30 minutes overall average cause we know this is the endgame the last film of phase 3 so, I guess it would have been perfect if everyone hadn't come. So, calling everyone's back that ruined everything. And then Tony's Funeral I guess the best sequence in the film.
The character development of the Tony, Captain, and Hawkeye was good. These characters were so special cause of their unique way. Favourite scene sequence was Tony's funeral. Had so much intense. Cinematography and Directing was good then the infinity war but not that much good then the first avengers. Overall wanted more, even far from perfect.
So, I give 6/10 because of,
The movie was too long. And music wasn't interesting.
Poor treatment of Thor, Hulk/Banner.
Completely ruined Thanos.
Re-introduction of vanished Avengers.
Poor screenplay.
Lack of captain marvel.
Time travel plot holes."
2211,Maybe my expectations were too high but in the end this move was just OK. It isn't bad - and it is a must see if you are invested in the Marvel Universe - but it isn't great. Maybe it gets lost in trying to include too many characters or maybe is Disney trying to be PC and intentionally make it try to appeal to too many people but in the end it made it less interesting. It has its crowd cheering moments and is epic - but when the big spoilers happen I almost didn't care. Hopefully Marvel can reboot with the X-men and Fantastic 4 because the current group has run its course.
2212,This is the best one.Where it began is where it ended
2213,This is the best movie. wathced it so many times and still watching.
2214,"I gave infinity war a 4 out of 10 for a variety of reasons. But the main reasons were that the ending wasn't conclusive even for an MCU film, and the villain's goal seemed extremely contrived. His goal even seems ridiculous to me within the realm of typical superhero villain motives.I felt annoyed that no hero character ever tried to intellectual argue with Thanos about his plans. No one ever asked why Thanos he couldn't try to use the infinity stones to make more resources rather than fewer inhabitants. Or why he felt that every planet was identical to his home planet in needing half their inhabitants to die, given the evidence of each planet have distinct differences problems.Nevertheless, I like the story idea of half of the main characters dying and needing to be saved by the other half. I just felt that a more unhinged villain or an accident could have been a better excuse for such a mishap occurring and needing to be resolved in Endgame. I was especially annoyed at the point when they nearly had the glove off Thanos before losing focus.But luckily Endgame is about solving the problems of Infinity War, and that story is a lot more fun and acceptable. Even if it involves time travel, at least none of the characters act buzzards like the physics of this alternate world.Endgame is the longest MCU film at just over 3 hours. But for me it only feels slow in a couple places.The story also provides some great reminiscing by reuniting all of the original Avengers and eliminating quite a bit of the clutter of so many characters within the last film. Only Ant-Man, Rocket, and Nebula really join the original 6 Avengers characters for the bulk of this film. The film's smaller cast allows for some more focus and growth for Tony Stark, Thor, Hulk, Hawk-eye and others as they each deal with their new normal differently.Even though the film turns out to be a time-travel movie, it also doesn't try to be like the typical time travel movie where changing the past impacts the present and future.The writers use time-travel more as an opportunity to scavenge things from the past and bring them to the present. It's sort of like the past is an alterable mirror reality they they discovered how to interact-with. This does lead to one annoyance for. The writers seem to disregard this narrative near the end when they decide that they must return the stones to where they took them. But overall I excuse this inconsistency because the sequence where they go back in time is very fun and provides for an interesting unexpected conclusion in the end.Like other Avengers movies the dialogue is often funny and the cinematography, music and acting are great.Overall I also given the film bonus points for really being a different kind of action movie then I ever thought I'd ever see. And I appreciate them deciding to not feel obliged to keep all of the characters alive forever. I like even good epic stories to eventually have some endings and conclusions. And the writers seemed to understand that in endgame.Overall it's a great ride. And I imagine if it's watched immediately after Infinity War it might make both films collected average about a 7 out of 10. I just with the infinity war would have been as good as Endgame. That would have really been something special."
2215,I mean it's okay to not like a movie but seriously 1 star reviews do not change the fact that avengers endgame despite its flaws is still an incredible achievement.
2216,"If you see the extremely negative reviews that are very vague as to why they disliked the movie so much, they most likely didn't see the movie at all and have a beef with either certain cast members or producers of the film, or they are disgruntled employees of the film industry. Writing misleading reviews is a way they think they can ""stick it to the man"" although it doesn't really do a whole lot. Nevertheless, Endgame was a spectacular ending to the MCU (the first generation at least). It terms of HOW GOOD the movie is compared to other top marvel films, it's on the same level with Infinity War, Civil War, Black Panther and Ragnarok. In my opinion, a sure fire contender for top 3 MCU films so far"
2217,"It had everything you could ask for in a movie and more. The only genre it doesn't really touch is romance. It has the drama, the comedy, the action, the clever and often heartwarming dialogue, the personal struggles, the betrayals, fulfilling character archs that make sense (Unlike Game of Thrones), and the perfect ending to an amazing movie journey."
2218,It was way too long and overrated. Infinity War was a much better movie. I don't get all the hype.
2219,I can't give more than 5/10 to a time travel movie that can't get time travel right.
2220,"A movie made for Disney (The Studio) and not for the fans!Filled with politically motivated scenes and themes of diversity that
didn't need to be.... Heroes torn down and completely dismantled specifically
Thor and The Hulk who most Marvel Comic fans will barely recognize. With Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr.'s contracts and desire to play their characters expiring this story line was forced to say good bye.It actually started promising enough picking up immediately where IW left off but then got side tracked and mired in too much nostalgia burdened with an homage to 10 years of Marvel Movies making the story disjointed and prolonged.Tony Stark's funeral was the burial of this Franchise, Stan Lee and Marvel movies. R.I.P. Marvel 2019!"
2221,"So good so good so goodsjhrufisjrhf7diajrfj
Djsi4jfi
Anfjir"
2222,Robert Downey JR needs an Oscar. Fantastic performance
2223,Just Awesome. An epic conclusion of an epic storyline. Makes you both happy and sad. One of the best superhero movies ever.
2224,"All through this movie it just feels like they are setting up an homage to the past marvel movies and characters, this in itself is not a bad ploy but the way it is executed is lame. They do not even try to make it interesting. And the whole movies drags along this way like it is entering some kind of depression. The Quantum time travel idea is extremely badly executed. it seems the idea was just an excuse to visit past movies and characters. In addition the characters are lame, they just don't have any mojo about themselves. It just feels like they knew it was the end and everybody appears bored or not interested. The last fight is pathetic. Again no excitement at all. And the heroes that died felt like they had to die just for the sake of it. Pathetic movie, even by Marvel standards."
2225,"It was a marvels fans dream. Loved it all the way. The perfect end to all the fans, giving moments of full action. Avengers: Endgame shows an incredible connection between all the movies of this amazing universe developed among eleven years.
Yes it slows down a bit. But over all a visual treat I must say."
2226,"There was so much hype about this movie. The social media made a good deal of fuzz about the ticket records it broke, its length etc, etc.To start with the obvious: It's not a bad Marvel Movie. But it's surely not the best. Regarding the script and the pace, I think it reminds me something like Avengers 2 and Thor 2 and that's not the best movies Marvel made.To me, Thor 3 is the best movie of all Marvel Universe, because it has a super good balance between action, dialogs, script, and humor. You never felt bored, you never felt you knew what's coming.On Endgame, sometimes I felt bored. It was a combination of medicre editing, script or acting. For example, fat Thor joke wasn't halve as good as bad haircut Thor. The scenes that should produce laughs, were between average and good.Although 3 hours long, it failed to show the extension of misery the planet has fallen into. In the opening scenes they easily kill Thanos, next scene misery, third scene hope, fourth scene Stark rejects the idea of time travel, next scene he finds the solution, next scene, the machine is ready. It's the very same Tony Stark that on Iron Man 2 spend half a movie trying to figure out how to create a new element.Time travel movies are always problematic because no matter how much mumbo jumbo terminology you add, the truth is that no matter how the heroes avoid to interact or change the future, their own existance on the past will change their universe. So, Endgame can laugh about Hot Tub Time Machine, but the truth is, it is still a HTTM movie.. ;DAlso, it's disappointing to continiously upgrade Thor's powers and on the final battle scenes, to take them back without a proper explanation. Thor easily defeated a Thanos that was on the maximum of his powers using the Infinity Gauntled on Infinity War, but on Endgame, he's unable to beat him even without Thanos having full power! That's silly.Yes it's a huge movie and even with 30 second cameos from top actors like Robert Redford or Michael Douglas you should need 1 hour for all characters but in the end, it's not about how many people you will squeeze into the movie. It's about how you will build a good pace with balanced action and humor.Maybe it's about the fact that everybody pretty much knew how things would end while on other movies like Thor 3, things were a bit more chaotic. Maybe it's because there wasn't much time about showing the details of a 5 year period. Maybe it was the fact that the first memory that jumps into my mind every time I recall the movie is Black Widow standing on a desk and coordinating x-avengers. Maybe is the fact that Thor from an arrogant young person, became super-strong in 5 movies (Thor 1,2,3, Avengers 1,2) and then, back to mediocre again. Maybe is the fact that Hulk was portrayed like the Beast from X-Men now. Maybe it was because we never got answers from the previous movie, like what Loki meant when he talked about the sun rising again, or why Hulk refused to help Banner. Even on this movie, Hawkeye becoming a renegade, makes no sense. All heroes that presented a second chance (Stark, Thor, Hawkeye) react like ""Nah, I will pass"" instead of be super-excited about it. I know 5 years passed, but the movie fails to show how this period changed our heroes.Thanos final fight on Infinity War, much inferior to that of Endgame.
Humor much much inferior to Thor3.Of course it is not a bad movie, but it could epic - and despite all those Anchorman cameos, it's not. But I guess, when you have limited time to repeat a wordwide success, surely you will have fails now and then.Endgame was destined to be an epic ending. It was. But only 8 out of 10."
2227,"Spoiler Free!Was endgame good? Yes
Was endgame fun? Per usual
Was endgame non stop action? Kind of
Was endgame $400 million to make? YesIf I gave you $400 million to make a movie it wouldn't be to difficult to pay top actors, writers and fund state of the art animations.Endgame is a relatively non-stop rollercoaster of Marvel nostalgia. Great end to a storied franchise? Kind of. This is nowhere near the cinematic greatness of LOTR: Return of the King. That was a true film through and through. Endgame is monster budget with 80% boring monologue and corny jokes. If that's what you enjoy then all power to you.Endgame has less action than any other Avengers film which I found incredibly disappointing and a let down.Would I recommend you to see endgame? Don't be silly, this is generational movie. Generational in the sense of big money, big actors, mega marketing and big answers to a beloved storyline of multiple hero's. Marvel movies are popular because we have been told by everyone we have to love them. If you have one bad thing to say about a Marvel movie, you will become more isolated than Tom Hanks in Castaway. Well worth a watch but please...pump the brakes."
2228,"Very enjoyable IMAX 3D experience! I love the quantum physics involved, very fascinated by it. A lot of funny jokes & devastating stuff. Top tier Marvel movie difficult to talk about without spoiling anything; definitely worth price of admission - love geeking out for a fun awesome movie!"
2229,"If you're reading this, go watch the movie (again)."
2230,"Breathtaking. Endgame raises the bar so high. The emotion, comedy and action all combined to produce a movie of epic proportions that probably won't be matched for many years to come! The best MCU movie. Easily one of my all time Top 5 favs."
2231,"This movie was build up since 2008. This has been one of the best MCU moments they ever shown. Not only this Movie was epic,but also emotional as well. This movie shown what is like to have an emotional roller coaster journey.Amazing conclusion to an epic journey.A fitting climax that takes infinity war to another level.I am Already planning to see it again.This is the movie that Marvel fans deserved."
2232,I feel like i miss something after this movie. i wanted to see monumental fight scenes where our heroes use all they power with such dedication anger but also with pain i wanted too feel how much they need to give from them in order to save our planet. it was not that dramatic (also music could be more dramatic) and this is my most minus to this movie. i felt like oh now they will do same fight but with just better ending for the universe. captain marvel well first of all i prefer long hairs over the cut version but it's not that important. she has great power in most scenes she is doin all alone destroying all on her way. but in last scene i saw that she needs some help to go through all that aliens horde it was so confusing .... also thor ... he is one of the strongest so where are these dark clouds and thunders destroying multiple hordes ... where is hulk who jump in the air to destroy ships... if feel like i saw different scale of their possibilities in this movie. well beside that it was fun and as a fan to all superhero movies i will buy blue ray to see it again and maybe search what i missed. i used to cry after infinite war after endgame hmm not rly.
2233,"Before I start, I rated Infinity war two stars higher. I thought it was very good movie.This movie has many good moments, but there are way too many didn't-have-to-be-there moments along side them. Too many characters, to much time devoted to each one. It's a series of vignettes tied loosely together by a outrageously irrational plot.But in the end, when I think about it, it was the largely pointless and depressing exposition that rattles on for a good hour that really killed it for me. I seriously almost walked out.I'm not going into plot specifics because they simply won't stand the scrutiny of logic, but I will mention that Captain Marvel seems to be there just to advertise that franchise and she comes and goes for no apparent reason. There's another product placement so obvious that I groaned out loud, along with several people around me. This is a movie driven by too many concerns other than simply making a really good film.If you loved it, god bless you. I found it maudlin and bouyed only by a lot of very, very good acting and interesting characters. If that's enough for you, say no more.I will say that if the point was to end my interest in future Marvel movies, it pretty much did the job."
2234,Although a huge movie it still made time for small character work and conclusions to the smallest of details left in the MCU. A perfect finish!
2235,"I know why some people are giving it 5/6/7/8 and no movie is perfect and it has some shortcoming but nonetheless it delivers what the finale of a saga is supposed to be. It is incomparabale to any other superhero movie. It has drama, comedy, high emotions and ultimate mind bending action scenes with a lot of twists and surprises to make this movie near perfect for me.
It doesn't deserve a rating below 10 and hats off to Russo brothers they are awesome."
2236,"Avengers: Endgame is an apotheosis, full of surprises, but I'll tell nothing, the Marvel policy has to be respected: spoilers are prohibited! What I saw was different from my expectations, but good surprises! The Marvel movies are not just films, they are more than that, but I don't figure out the right word. Avengers: Endgame is an epilogue like nothing similar! Go and watch it!"
2237,"The wait, The exitment, The enthusiasm for the movie End Game all get the value from the makers,
First of all a big Thank you to marvels & Rossue brothers, who has given us such a materpiece, hven't seen the movie so big & marvelous..!!
Every character has a part to play, every character is worth
All the actors have done fab jobs,Direction of Anthony & Joe Rousse has impressed us again, they have shown their worth with Winter Soldier,
Writer this time has evolve more, stephen macfy, what a story & what a pick uo of the movie, every second of the movie is saying sonethin"
2238,"Amazed...this last ride was incredible!! The story line was amazing, it dove deep into the characters persona. What a great way to close it out!!"
2239,"Warning - SpoilersOverall, Endgame is a good but not great superhero movie. Marvel did something I never thought possible, they made a boring movie. I understand it is difficult to maintain continuity over 20+ movies and introduce new characters and plots along the way and Marvel has done a phenomenal job with the MCU. This culminated in the excellent Infinity War which I loved and have watched 5 or 6 times now. What made IW great was the energy they were able to maintain while weaving together different characters and stories. It was funny, emotional, and had lots of great action.Here are some things I liked about Endgame:
Tony's ending seemed like a fitting conclusion for this phase. He essentially started the MCU way back in 2008 and his sendoff here was a nice tribute to his character. I didn't feel like he needed to die and thought he would serve as a father figure and guide for Peter Parker in future Spiderman movies but can see how Marvel went in this direction.Captain America living but altering his past seemed like a choice he would make given how he seemed to have no place in the present or future. He lived in the past and was a relic of a bygone era. The ending was a bit schmaltzy but I liked him passing on the shield to Sam. One issue, so Cap can suddenly wield Mjolnir and summon lightning?What I didn't like:Runtime and pacing! Ok, so they wanted to make a 3 hour movie, fine, I love Return of the King and all. If you do that, you have to keep the energy up! I felt like Marvel didn't know what to do with the characters that survived the snap. Without most of the Guardians, Black Panther, Dr. Strange, Spidey, etc., the focus was on minor characters like Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nebula. Did we really need to see Hawkeye mope around for 180 minutes?? Strange move for Marvel to snap most of the newer (and funnier!) heroes and not bring them back until the last 30 minutes of the movie. These seemed more like cameo appearances to me. It produced a lot of forced comedy which no one in my theater laughed at. I even missed Ebony Maw and the CoT who really fleshed out the bad guys in IW. Without these interactions which made IW so great, the movie dragged!Thor and Hulk. It's an absolute disgrace to turn Thor into a Jim Carrey impersonation of Jim Morrison for most of this movie. I chuckled when he is introduced but the joke became old fast. He is one of the best developed characters in Ragnarok and IW because he has so much emotional baggage regarding Thanos and they ruined him here. In the first 120 minutes he makes no contribution to the plot, as if he is just a drunk frat boy hung over in the corner. Professor Hulk was okay but they could have spent at least 10 minutes of the first 2 hours showing us how he made that balance happen. Wouldn't that have been cool?? We are first introduced to him in a diner dabbing for some kids taking selfies, pretty lame.Time travel and hand waving. Okay so time travel is how they figure out how to defeat Thanos and undo the snap. I'll suspend belief a bit on how it works but did Tony really figure it out after running a few models in his basement in 1 day?? I won't even get into the altered timelines and whether or not you change the future by changing the past!Thanos was written so well in IW, he had a clear plan and was shown as a sometimes conflicted villain. Here he just decides to destroy everything because the survivors couldn't let go of the past 5 years later. No discussion of balance, just a one note villain.Captain Marvel. So we have an all-powerful being who can pretty much rip through any opponent or ship but she basically says I'll see you in 2 hours instead of helping out with the time travel stuff?Not showing everyone coming back when Hulk reversed the snap. Marvel missed a huge opportunity to show Black Panther, Spidey, etc. coming back into existence!! Where were they when it happened? What year was it? To have a 3 hour movie but not include this is baffling! It would have been a huge emotional moment to show their reactions and their reunions with those that survived. They all just come walking out of portals at the same time to conveniently battle Thanos in the end. But hey, we got to see some birds come back so there's that.Overall, I expected much more content in a 3 hour movie. Not bringing back the snapped characters earlier in the movie left them out of the majority of the plot and affected the pace and energy. The great interactions between the GotG, Thor, etc. in IW were missing until the very end of this one. The movie could have easily been 2 to 2.5 hours and tightened up a lot. Also, I expected to see a new big bad guy show up at some point but that will have to wait for Phase 4 I suppose. In the end, my 9 year old loved it so I guess that's all that matters!"
2240,"Infinity War is my favorite Marvel film by far. This chapter or finale felt a little flat for me. I understand it's hard to compress everything this large into a 3 hour film, I truly do. But, I felt some things were dwelled on for too long while some things were not explained well or at all. One scene was emotional for sure while others did not hit home for me. I truly feel in my heart of hearts that the plot should have gone in another direction with the ending, but I do get why it did what it did. Overall it was a decent movie that in the sense of all things completed has done that for this arch."
2241,This is the best movie I have ever seen! This movie is such a love letter to the fans of Marvel. I have never had so much emotion drawn from me in a movie. The story is so amazing and a beautiful way to end the Marvel Infinity Saga.
2242,"A movie like this shouldn't be able to exist. A 3 hour long movie that gives a conclusion to a universe that has been building up for 11 years. A movie that seamlessly blends the directorial visions of all the directors of past films and the tones present in those films. A movie whose first act let's you see the hopelessness that the hero's we have seen for the past 10 years. But, is able to put the emotional stake and realize they actually lost. A movie that is able to be a action adventure comedy and a second act that is a fantastic heist movie. A movie that is able to make time travel make sense. The second act is fantastic a cross between 3 teams that pull off a superhero oceans 11 heist and it works perfectly. Then the final act come to the climactic end that we all wanted. When Captain America has a broken shield in one hand and then mjolnir and says ""avengers assemble"" absolutely the best way to give comic book fans the ending battle they deserve. A once and a generation movie that will never be topped by another superhero movie."
2243,"AVENGERS : ENDGAMEA Humongous tribute to the characters Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Captain Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) for being a vital part in Marvel Cinematic Universe.Never seen such a huge franchise paying a proper payoff to these characters.Do not watch Endgame untill you watch all the marvel films starting from Ironman to Infinity war.First half of the movie travels at a slower pace because this flick contains a phenomenal story and character arc built for the powerpacked other half.Different dimensions of Capt'n and Thor characters were shown to the audience. Which will keep the them excited throughout the movie.Directors Russo brothers came up with an epic cinematic ending. The determination and conviction for such a complex screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen Mcfeely has to be appreciated.We as an audience would have presumed that this film would end in a certain way. But, there are lot other Easter eggs and jaw dropping scenes which excites us and also make us whimper.Overall, with Avengers : Endgame, there is really something that comes to an end. BTW keep your tissues handy!!"
2244,"One of the best movies I've ever seen , simply EPIC , Enough said"
2245,"End of era.
Worth watching.
There is every thing which is required in a perfect movie. There is drama, action, emotion, every rhiThank you Stan Lee."
2246,"Magnificent, thank you for everything Tony and Cap"
2247,The genre has been completed. It was the best superhero film ever. It completed an epic journey of superhero films.
2248,"There have been few movies in history that created this kind of hype - a sociological and emotional mass hysteria that covered the globe. An expectation that surpassed all others, an ending that everyone was expecting yet caught everyone by surprise, shock and awe. Endgame had a lot of expectations to fulfill, and it surpassed them all... light years from what was expected.Never has a year passed so quickly and with so much hype. The end days before the premiere were filled with nothing but expectation, fingernail biting and prolonged stages of sleep deprivation and theory development. If one was being scrubbed by one's boss - it didn't matter - Endgame is in a couple of days... if one was ill, one got better on the day of the premiere. Endgame had an effect that was so much more than a movie. It was an event of a generation, an ending to a decade long story and the finalization of all the character's arks. And yet, it had to be a sequel worthy of Infinity war. How was this possible to achieve all that in a single movie?1) The story. Unlike Infinity war which was much more a character driven movie (especially Thanos and the gang on Titan) Endgame is a story driven movie. The entire movie is split in three segments: a) the beginning; b) the middle; c) the endgame. The beginning is a bit rushed, uneasy on the casual viewer, expecting too much from the audience to follow in one moment. But then, it slows down, takes it's time with a realization that these characters are at their end and the story converges into a goodbye of sorts from their most important counterparts and their most important segments from the last ten years. This is Endgame's most triumphant segment - the realization of the magnitude of its characters and their meaning in the end - their own humanity and importance that they have for the viewers. However, Endgame holds its most powerful aspects 'til the very end. The climactic battle with Thanos and his army (again) is one that can easily rival Lord of the Rings or the Hobbit or Kingdom of Heaven etc. But, the magnitude of the battle and the number of heroes involved makes the endgame battle so powerful and overwhelming that it leaves the viewer in a perpetual state of adrenaline fulled with hype from start to finish. It is almost impossible to keep track of where all of them are and what they are doing but that is the best part - all of them are completely involved with everything they got - whatever it takes. Even the all-girl battle segment is entertaining and shows how much Marvel respects all of its characters no mater how small their role in any movie was. Up until the end, when Endgame shows it's true colors as Infinity war's successor, when it emotionally destroys almost everyone watching the movie. The final demise is the perfect and flawless ending for one of cinema's most recognizable and lovable heroes. The difficulty of his demise is, at this point, unprecedented. Endgame builds itself all the way up to a spectacular and unforgettable climax that resolves itself in just the perfect and (un)wanted way - perfection.2) The acting. Closely connected to the story are the actors that live the characters they are playing. There is no more acting with these people, the literally are those character down to their very core, and we have lived with them. Though better or worse, through all the trials and errors, thought all the sorrow and pain up until the end, when all of their strength combined (not only as characters but as actors and as people) they gave us an end worthy of legends. An ending that should be studied in movie history books and taught as a principle of movie making. The original Avengers, the ones that made comic book heroes real and important, are the ones that will be remembered after this movie. And they should be regarded as the heroes they have played. What hurts the most is the fact that these people really have feelings for each other and in their goodbyes and tears one really feels sorrow and pain. The soul stone segment and the phone call segment are perfect examples of these segments. But the love that bursts from the screen at the: ""You rest now"" scene
and the tears that flow afterwards are not acting. These kind of emotions do not psychologically constitute as acting - they are real and they are powerful. Because of their connection in such a way do the viewers feel and connect so deeply with some of their demises.3) The direction. To keep such a mastodon of a movie at bay and in such a coherent way is truly masterful. The Russo's directed the movie so that three hours feels more like an hour and a half (maybe the quantum theory is true after all). With so much to be told, and to be told with such respect, no ordinary director could have made this the way they did. It is also important to remember that they have directed MCU's finest movies - The Winter Soldier, Civil War, Infinity War, so they have more than enough practice. Henceforth, their balance of character driven story arks and finishing a ten year old story really makes one wonder how such perfection was achieved. Even though the first 20 minutes of the movie feels a bit too rushed with editing being a bit rigorous, the rest of the movie feels incredibly easy and fluent.4) The music. Silvestry actually did not make two soundtracks but used all the important tunes and themes used so far and combined them into something new and powerful. The start of the Endgame battle music feels and sounds like adrenaline being injected right into ones spine, while the eulogy of the godfather of the MCU sound and feels so emotional and powerful that in comparison to the strength felt merely seconds before creates an emotional burst in the viewers unprecedented in modern cinema.All in all, this is a near perfect movie. A flawless, emotional, powerful ride from start to finish. It is unlike anything one has ever seen or felt while watching a movie. Endgame was, is, and always will be one of the best movies ever made. It will remain in movie history as the most important ending to a story and characters beloved by millions. One does not see Endgame, one feels it, breathes it and lives with it. A long, long time will pass before anyone ever makes something even remotely close to the perfection that is Endgame."
2249,"First ever movie review and probably my last but to say it was a massive let down was an understatement And for me how the Russo's got it so wrong after their brilliant films that led to this is anybodies guess. All I can think is they ran out of ideas and made this political to keep the lefties happy. Winter soldier 8/10 was quality, civil war 9/10 even better and infinity war 10/10 just awesome in every way but to end on this was a total let down. Been watching all the films since the first iron man, and have them all on DVD , watched some even 4 or 5 times they are that good. Thor: Ragnarok was up there with IW for me. The plot holes in the previous films didn't bother me as they were so good I got past them but as this was so bad and boring it needs pulling apart since it has insulted all our intelligence. I gave it a 7 as the path that has been laid with all 21 films before this was pretty awesome to be fair but if this was a stand alone movie it would get a 5 or 6 maximum. Hawkeye had way too much screen time yet proper super heroes like scarlet witch, captain marvel, doctor strange, black panther to name a few were hardly in it. Personally I don't watch a superhero film for drama and drivel and sentimentally. There are plenty of other films out there that are aimed at that. I want decent but silly story and stupidly brilliant over the top action and silly mindless violence which is basically what IW was. For me the only thing that kept it going was the humor, as usual, like the effects both were pretty good but in the main a complete let down. I knew not to expect better than IW but as this is the ""big one"" it had the right to be better.
Probably 3 or 4 fight scenes before the big fight at the end which was kind of over before it began. The fights in the first 15 mins of IW out did the half a dozen or so here, including the ""gran finale"" Not sure why they ruined the hulk so much either. After his non appearance in infinity war and since Thanos battered him surely a hulk revenge fight would of been on the cards but what they did with hulk in this film, or what they didn't do is what we should be asking. Ruined Thor too. The 2 most powerful heroes and they pointless really. Was that to keep it all about Stark / Cap?. It seemed like a very very long soap opera trying to tackle the issues of the world, diversity being the number 1 and that's what they got wrong for me. But even if they wanted to keep the snowflake brigade happy, the scene where the females super heroes line up to sort everything out was a non starter too. Scarlet witch, captain marvel, Potts (Marvel seem to have forgotten that she has that fire power thing for Iron man 3) in iron man suit, okoye etc. So between them they can raise some hell again didn't really do anything. Where was Loki, heimdall I know they didn't die in the snap but neither did Thanos' 3 henhmem who all died in IW but somehow we're back. It tells you everything that one of the main talking points by critics celebrating MCU first openly gay character!!. Not really just a fat bloke sat around a group moaning about he lost his boyfriend in the snap. That scene was 3 minutes or so long and it was one of the directors playing him too. So in a film 3 hours long a gay character has 3 mins of fame and that's their way of tackling the so called diversity issues. It's called tokenism.We will never know why they ruined the film so badly especially after the build up of the previous films. I'm 46 and my son is 18 and he was gutted it was so bad.Just hope spider man gets back to where it should be...mindless entertainment and not politics!!!!"
2250,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has given us a lot of great characters and pulling of a final movie that uses all their unique abilities equally was always going to be a near impossible task. Endgame is proof of that. It didn't feel like the Avengers became a real team or learned much during these 22 movies. Their plans and tactics felt amateurish. I was hoping for something deeper and cleverer, but that never materialized. It was entertaining, well produced and acted, but for me it never got near masterpiece territory."
2251,"I'm giving this movie a 10/10.What I think a lot of people are missing when rating this movie so low is the fact that it's obviously going to have a different tone compared to Infinity's War. Endgame starts with hope and then is immediately shut down when Thanos admits to destroying the stones. So yes, it's going to be less ""energetic"".Certain characters are going to be handling the situation differently as well. Let's take Thor, he's completely and utterly defeated. He could have stopped Thanos in IW but didn't. So he's going to be self-destructive. Sure he was made into comic relief but he always was (let's be honest). And if you know the marvel universe at all you'd know captain America wields the hammer since he's worthy (apparently that was hard to understand). OH and did you know in the MCU/DC crossover in the comic books superman does as well??Anyway, I think if you gave yourself high expectations you wouldn't enjoy the film. Go in with an open mind and it'll be just as amazing as IW. You'll feel like a 6 year old watching your favourite cartoon crossover episode on a Saturday morning."
2252,"Avengers Endgame is truly one of the best epic films ever made..
This film literally made entire theatre whistle, laugh, cry, sad and shout their lungs out!!!
There are few moments which will make every marvel cry, no matter how hard they hold onto...."
2253,Infinity War was better. I expected from Endgame less humor and more thrilling scenes but that's ok.
2254,"There is not enough words to describe this piece of art, literally the best thing I've ever seen, it has it all, all the emotions all any one could ever want in a movie is there. You're missing a lifetime experience if you haven't seen it yet."
2255,"Film full of emotions, happiness, fun, anger and sadness, there is a bit of everything"
2256,"Being a big fan of the Marvel Universe I was very disappointed to first sit through two hours of a very weird, boring and depressing Inception-like Movie.
They had a lot of good ideas but didn't manage to make it a good movie. If you can just skip the first two hours and watch the ending. I was so pissed when the good parts came that I had a hard time really enjoying them."
2257,"Watched it in 4DX. Premiere morning.
This film makes me happy, sad, gives me peace and anger at the same time.
It's a new caliber of superheroes movie. 3 hours means nothing.As other marvel films, the sound, the effect and CGI is a top class.
Story wise, yes we will find some minor loophole, and yes, it's argueable, but I can't think of any major plot hole that can makes me hates this film. Especially it's a film that conclude all previous films.If you feeling happy, angry, sad or peace, believe me we are did.. and that's why this film is amazing and beautiful. A film that truly 11/10.
It's a no brainer if you think and feel the same as me."
2258,"I laughed, I cried, I exclaimed, I cried, I laughed, I cried and then I kept crying.Rest assured, the writers do these characters every justice they deserve, by closing long running arcs beautifully, albeit, sadly. It is a painful goodbye to the Infinity Arc but they've done it superbly. The endgame of over 22 films, a saga spanning 11 years has culminated into something so powerful, so awe inspiring on the screen, I urge every one to watch it to feel firsthand, the beauty, the pain and triumph of our heroes.The movie picks up right where the previous left off. It allows the viewer some time to cope with the devastation wrecked by Thanos in the previous film. It is remarkable and therefore worth noting that every trailer issued for this movie comes in the first 20 mins of the movie and hence everything afterwards is such a whirlwind. The movie gives nod to some of our favourite moments in the past films and still continues to give.You will have many naysayers. Dont listen to them. The movie is powerful. The effects, the music, the story, the emotions. Its honestly a hell of a ride.Stan Lee is up there somewhere, smiling. And we too will learn to smile through our tears."
2259,Dreadful and far far far to politically correct.Ultra left hug fest
2260,"Good story. Exciting battle. Marvel fans mustn't have been spoiled before watching this. But it may be not so friendly to newcomers. If the 181 minutes were full of excitements that would be definitely ok but actually there're a significant amount of quiet and peaceful moments, puzzling people who watch Marvel film for the first time. I don't know how would a Marvel fan judge them."
2261,The movie is not good much as i hoped.I don't know why are these high rates for ? MY GOD Imdb
2262,Script-wise it is not a bad movie. But I really don't like the bad jokes. The action scenes are way too much for me...
2263,T was a good movie but the beginning was kinda boring so I didn't really enjoy watching the first hour but the ending WAS THE BEST
2264,"What a movie. The way the Russo Brothers has brought in the emotions, as well as the action scenes. Brilliant Screenplay, what an acting by all the actors especially, Robert Downey Jr. 3 hrs just flew, I did not get bored in any part, an engaging movie. VFX was great, Marvel has not compromised with its VFX. The best Avengers movie when compared with the other three. A visual treat for all the Marvel fans. Loved it."
2265,"I can't believe it, why are people is giving this a 1/10 it's a Masterpiece and original people theses days just don't have good taste on movies they just go like other overrated movies the ending is so amazing"
2266,Wow. I saw this movie the exact day it came out and I was kind blown by it and the fact it has permanent deaths in it is mind blowing. I will miss iron man alot and I wish to god he is only in prequels like before endgame cause even though I would like him to be in more films it would be a dumb move to add him back. One think I hate about the film though is the runtime 3hours and 1minute is about too long. Other than that I love this film. You should check it out if you haven't already.
2267,"This movie has to doso much and bring together so many different characters and to resolve the situation from Infinity War in a satisfying way, and they did it! I love re-watching this movie, it's amazing.I think some of the plot points are a bit contrived, but overalliit's just amazing that they pulled it off so well."
2268,"After watching Avengers Infinity War everyone who watched that film had a question ""what is going to happen next?' and this film answer our every single question. This is not just a film, this an experience that you will never forget."
2269,"This is the best mcu movie ever ! This film is rich in emotions and humor, this show perfectly concludes this time of 22 films !"
2270,"Just wow, i read things like:
""it's just so cheap to mess with time, then why they don't kill thanos so endgame doesn't even has to happen 1/10"". - Did you even watch the movie? (actually a lot of people said that i honestly can't believe it)
""Overrated, only marvel fans will like it 1/10"" - It's the last of 22 movies, if you don't like marvel im guessing you don't like the other 21 movies, so what are you even doing here?
""it ruined thanos and the heroes one with no casualties like every superhero movie 1/10"" WHAT?
And literally tons of senseless 1/10 without even writing something, just pure hate.
I could go all day but no ty.My review:
I know it's not a perfect movie, but it was good. I liked it."
2271,"It was totally not what I was expecting and It's so predictable and boring.
The ending scene where all current heroes pass on their title to the next generation looks so ridiculous, because it's either a woman, black guy or a black woman.
The all female scene at the end is so cringy! OMFG!
I think Marvel has betrayed all their fans by showing their true, SJW face at the end of this movie. Please Disney, stop shoving your black and SJW propaganda down our throats, we are really full with it.
Right after the previous movie everyone knew they are going to use a time machine.
Overall, even if you ignore all those cringy moments, the movie is slow paced and quite predictable, as I already said. 5 stars for the effort."
2272,"Avengers Endgame is an SUPER AWESOME movie .
It actually made me cry and I'm a crying person."
2273,"Infinity war was so good. i was expecting this to be amazing, but now the best heros are just... gone. what? it was too quick. too rushed. some of the best elements of the mcu are just out.i would like to say that there defiantly some amazing parts of this movie. there was heavy action (maybe a little much) and wasn't very predictable. it certainly kept you on the edge of your seat.however, some of the best parts of the mcu are just gone. they could have done so much more, and deserved better."
2274,"Damn what an end this is the best film of marvel so far just one word .. hulk like that ? I mean come on he look so cute , powerless this is not hulk that we all knew .. but at the end thank you for this beautiful movie"
2275,"Endgame will and always be my favourite superhero movie they way the put an end to certain characters is so emotional 😭😭😭steve finally got to live his life that he always wanted, tony got to say a goodbye to his father and much😭😭."
2276,A must watch movie but only those who have watched previous parts will understand.
2277,They ended and brought 22 movies together perfectly
2278,"Unfortunately, this did not live up to the hype. Introducing new superheroes after Infinity Game reflects lazy writing. Fat Thor was a highlight and worth seeing but the final fight scene and climax were absolutely ridiculous and unimaginative. It's unbelievable how much a studio will spend on actors and advertising but not on dialing in the story line or making the defeat of the most powerful being in the universe believable. It will make tons of money but could have been so much better."
2279,"Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anythingPeace!"
2280,"Biggest issue with any avengers movie: tone. Trying to go from scene to scene in such quick succession, changing characters, emotions, setting, gives me whiplash. Though I don't think a marvel movie needed to explain time travel, it sets rules and breaks them (although most time travel movies do this to some degree. The only egregious example of Endgame doing it is at the end of the movie, when Steve Rogers doesn't come back from the past.)My largest gripe was that they made infinity war 2. There was no way to top infinity war, that massive battle scene could never be measured up to. So they found a way to use time travel and do it again.Not to mention, fat, depressed, alcoholic Thor played for laughs. No idea why they thought fat depressed alcoholic was a good running gag.I didn't hate it. It was okay. If I turn off my brain it's a fun movie to watch, and I totally get why people like it. I don't have anything against marvel movies either, I really enjoyed infinity war and give it a solid 8/10. I just saw quite a few issues with this one."
2281,"Infinity war was overall a better movie, but this movie had the disadvantage of being the follow up to that movie. A good chunk of this movie is essentially remembering what happened during infinity war. The struggle against Thanos in this movie... It just isnt done in a satisfying way.Before Infinity war came out last year, it was already confirmed there would be another Avengers follow up this year. It was speculated that Endgame was actually going to be called ""Infinity war part 2"". Unfortunately, this is Endgame, but it SHOULD have been Infinity war part 2. I know that is very vague, Im trying to be vague, but essentially because of what happened in Infinity War, it was pretty much impossible to make a sequel which feels like it even is the same story with the same consistency & epic feel. Or at least, that is not what we got.Captain Marvel kinda sucks in this movie. She is a boring character with magic powers. Ughhh great. In hindsight, the tease in Infinity war was cool, but it makes it into a big letdown. And this is kind of the story of the whole movie, if Infinity War was the teaser. (Although it isnt quite that bad, this movie is still pretty good, unlike Captain Marvel in it.)"
2282,"If a couple you know, having lived together for eleven years, decide to hold a huge wedding, spare no expense, and invite everyone they know, the net effect would be a lot like Avengers Endgame: several hours of your life you feel you'll never get back, and the one thing everyone agrees on is, thank god it's over.
I write this as someone who was a Marvel fan for a few years in the sixties, when these characters appeared only on the printed page. Then I forgot about the characters for thirty years, and came back to them when I had kids and we watched Marvel shows together: first the 1990s animated series, then the films beginning with the first X-Men in 2000.
From those first films, the Marvel franchise has been in the hands of skilled writers and directors who take the art seriously - very seriously. The current MCU, however, starting with 2008's Iron Man, peaked after a few years with the first two Captain America films, and 2012's The Avengers. After that, the seeming need to expand the universe led to increasingly messier films, making superstars out of all of its lead actors while squeezing them into less and less screen time; bit players in their own movies. Last year's Avengers: Infinity War, merging all existing Avengers with the intergalactic storylines of the Guardians of the Galaxy was bad enough, but Endgame outdoes it in terms of taking a modestly priced and scaled, mildly subversive art form (the comic book) and turning it into an extravagantly budgeted, exhausting mess (the Hollywood blockbuster).
The result is that although the climax of Endgame, bringing in almost every character who's appeared in the films since 2008, is pitched for thrills, the effect is the opposite. The return of all the heroes who disintegrated at the end of Infinity War is supposed to make us cheer, but it's as tiresome as the last drunken dinner speech at the aforementioned wedding. ""Really? I was hoping I could go home. Can't anyone shut him up?""
The skills that go into these films are undeniable, but there seems to be a tipping point past which plotting this many characters becomes a matter of chance and luck. As the films grow from one super-hero against one-supervillain (Iron Man; Captain America the First Avenger) to two or three super-heroes against a larger force (Iron Man II; Captain America the Winter Soldier) to a veritable platoon of super-heroes against armies of robots/aliens/bad guys, the limits are passed. Even an expert like Joss Whedon couldn't stop Avengers: Age of Ultron from running out of steam like a badly timed fireworks display. Nevertheless, partly through their quality casts, the appeal of the films grows: like a dry spell in the episodes of a soap opera, the audiences keep watching because they've bonded with the characters and will stick with them, hoping that eventually the relationship will get better.
But a soap opera ain't the opera, and Endgame suffers from the blockbuster syndrome of giving the viewer too much of everything and not enough of anything. ""Angry and wanting more"" I think Pauline Kael called the Hollywood blockbuster, but in the case of Avengers: Endgame we can amend this to ""angry and wanting less."""
2283,No amount of words can explain this rollercoaster of emotions 😱😱😱😱😱😱
2284,"The film once again managed to include all emotions, just like infinity war did.
At the beginning it was not what I was expecting, and from I've gathered this has caused many people to disregard the whole film, but the fact they tried something different makes it unique. The film still reached a point where the whole tone flipped and this is where it became even better.
This is the only film I have been to see that has made the audience applaud, that must show how these films have been able to create such a connection with the MCU community to the characters."
2285,"This was a decent movie but not great & definitely not on par with Infinity War.
There were too many inconsistencies for example Captain America could summon Thor's hammer because he was worthy but how did he use thunder when he's not a God?
Thor is able to cut off Thanos head and hand then later no one can kill him.
Marvel conveniently played down character's powers and made Thanos more powerful when it suited them,very inconsistent.
There was a whole movie about Captain Marvel just over a month before this movie,at the end of Infinity War Nick Fury paged her yet she was barely in the movie for 10mins,she came from Earth yet said she had to go and fight for other planets,made no sense. Kinda felt duped in to watching all these movies only for them not to totally tie up in the end.
Hawkeye got a lot of screen time but there was no real movie about him.
I think this movie was no as good as Infinity War because Stan Lee passed before it was finished which was a shame as its clear how much influence he's had on movies.
Stan Lee really did make these movies special RIP"
2286,"I remember when Superman died and how in the comic book world there was shock, dismay and great out cry necessitating him coming back. It served the purpose of hooking the audience and holding them captive. The same thing was applied to Spock dying in Star Trek again proving successful in generating fan response and revenue. Before Endgame came out and I only had the second movie to go by, I knew they all had to come back and I also knew that time travel played a part in it as there are only so many ways to come back. Sure enough, Endgame time-traveled and brought them back. The formula still works. Logically speaking, Disney didn't spend mutli-billions to kill everyone off however in the comic book world of which I keep reminding myself that anything is possible they can get away with these things. Knowing this before hand diminished my enjoyment of the Endgame but it wasn't limited to just that either. I am watching after everyone is brought back and they still couldn't defeat Thanos as a group or individually and that is without the stones mind you. With the stones they prevail making the stones more important than any Marvel character known. Before you vote on my sharing, be advised I have been reading comics for decades and was raised in that world and even collected them. I support and encourage the comic book world but would like them to keep it closer to reality than all-out fantasy suspension of major beliefs. One last thing. They keep using God as in OMG or other variations which totally contradicts the comic book world. That shouldn't be in the script for GOD is the ultimate super-hero and his comic would outsell everyones. Keep it real and I'll keep coming back."
2287,"I cant say I was disappointed in Endgame as a whole, they wrapped up this phase in the franchise pretty well.Parts did drag on longer than needed, other parts rushed that could have used more time. But that's ok I can deal with that.Endgame was not as good as Infinity War in my opinion, IW had much better pacing and dialogue than EG and the story was much better.Stuff I liked:Tony Stark/Steve Rodgers dialogue. Any time those two are on screen together it just flat out works. They could talk about dinner reservations and I'd be engrossed in that conversation..Lewboski reference. Loved it..Hawkeye/Black Widow going after the Soul Stone. You knew one of them was going to have to die to get it but intense and a surprise all the way through. Well done.Soundtrack. Dear Mr. Fantasy a fav of mine and to hear that open made my night.How they brought back Gamora. Nice twist didn't see that coming. And the ""real"" Nebula working on her to win her over.Starks death, Rodger's ending. Both perfect and worked. Glad he got his dance and a real lifeFew things I didn't care for.Wanted more Rocket interaction with the other Avengers. Expected more Rocket/Tony Stark back and forth in witty dialogue. Would have been epic.Captain Marvel. Over powered and didn't earn it. Hoped for better than he solo movie and it never happened.Time Travel. I figured the quantum realm would come into play to reverse things, but Stark figuring out time travel in general was a little much. I think with some creative writing they could have skipped all that time travel discovery stuff and just used the quantum realm angle to fix things and bring people back.Not enough Thanos. Even with Thanos coming back into play, not enough screen time. He's way to great a character and needed much more attention. In EG he didn't have as great the dialogue as IW gave him and even less depth than in IW. Jim Starlin's creation deserved better.The whole Battle of the Five Armies Hobbit ending... Would have been more intense with just Thanos and his Black Order - they could have held their own against all the Avengers new and oldAs a whole though I got to admit I walked away satisfied. We always want more and/or expect different or better, but this is what we got.I can live with it and be happy. Thank you Marvel Studios"
2288,"Like most of the MCU, this film hits its highs. Snappy dialogue, likable characters, has some heart, laughs aplenty, huge cast, pop-culture references galore. You go see it and you enjoy yourself. But by the time you make it from your theater seat to your car, it's already started wearing off. This is much of my gripe with MCU films as a whole and much of my gripe with Endgame.I enjoyed the film. Like I said, fun. In the way that eating cotton candy is fun but leads to stomach pain minutes after you're done. Endgame suffers from too much fan-service at best and at worst is flat-out dumb and doesn't make sense.The Highs:
There's real heart here. The scenes with fathers and daughters got me in the feels. The Hawkeye opening with his family was really well-done. The Tony Stark daughter stuff was nice. I appreciated the opening third for giving in to the dark ending of the last film. I loved Fat Thor. And I thought the ending, though expected, was well executed.The Lows:
The middle chapter is a mess. I mean, a real mess. The time-traveling plot is so nonsensical that at one point they literally start rattling off other time-travel movies that don't make sense to excuse themselves. One of the lovable things about the MCU is it doesn't take itself too seriously, but this feels like a bridge too far. It literally doesn't make sense that they can change somethings and not others, and it's convoluted and it involves battery packs.The CGI overload gets tiresome. There are entire scenes where no one real is even on screen. You have giant purple Josh Brolin with a scrotum chin talking to blue lady with a mix of 6'8"" Voldemort at Power Forward. I like some of this, but over-reliance on it feels too artificial and video-game like.The film tries to fit way too much in, such as the dark Hawkeye plotline that is referred to but mostly happens offscreen until one 2-minute fight. We didn't need to see that.While the device of literally traveling back through previous movies has a nostalgic touch, is that the best way to really wrap up the story? Or should we blaze a new trail here?Overall, the whole snap felt contrived, knowing that all the characters would come back and that the only one who would die were Cap and Iron Man, largely because the actors' contracts are up. We talked at the office about this going in and said Iron Man would die and Cap would likely go back to the '40s. So where's the surprising storytelling here?This is fun, entertaining popcorn fare, but it has zero depth and nothing truly fresh to offer.If you're reading this in the 2020s you probably agree this film doesn't hold up at all.Or you've gotten your hands on one of those magic Duracells."
2289,"I've watched the majority of Marvel's movies/series and this movie seems to be the most boring of all of them. The storyline is predictable, the first part supposedly was meant to tell spectators how discouraged and depressed the surviving characters were, but the actors didn't do a good job there. The second action part was okay and the 3d effects were amazing. So the points go mainly for the visual effects."
2290,"I cried and laughed and blah, blah, blah. CGI was great, but I can't get past all the subtext to create plot rules and then completley blow them put of the water. I can think of about 5 minutes of scenes and a slightly different way to handle the last moments of the battle that would have covered those holes. I can't believe no one said ""Hang on a minute. This wont work."""
2291,"In my point of view , this avengers was not thought up well. Going back to the past to save the world? Seriously? The previous part Thanos tried so much to get the stones and this part he regret what he did?"
2292,"Just ordinary, nothing special from this movie with almost 3 hours duration"
2293,"There is spectacle, although like a lot of massive CGI battles, you can't figure out what the hell is going on (Frankly, Hawkeye's sword fight with another human might have been the most coherent fight). There are SOME tender moments that work (and others that don't). There were lots of funny moments, usually provided by Thor.All in all, a capable action flick. But, it could have been so much more, if they'd gone full nerd. Why do I say that? Because nerds would have got ""power"" situation right. The heroes powers fluctuate so greatly between movies, and even within the movie that it could drive a purist mad. There is nothing wrong with fantasy movies (e.g. sci-fi, space, Hobbit, etc.), but the worlds need to be internally consistent to be fun. Also, the ""cavalry charge"" at the end of all these movies is getting tiresome. (But, I get the ""nick of time"" stuff generically pumps up the ""dramatic tension.""...a little)Anyway, it isn't top 10 of the MCU, but it's probably top 15. I'd still probably see Deadpool over and over again, rather than continue to see these middling, mass produced, corporate exercises. Like Star Wars the early years with Lucas instead of Disney. These corporate movies will never endanger the golden goose, or do anything surprising."
2294,"It took Tony Stark one day to discover time travel? why not introduce the idea of time travel at the beginning then have tony stark develop and perfect time travel with the 5 year gap? that seems more reasonableThe ruined remains of society cannot be bothered to sweep the streets and remove abandoned cargo ships from the harbor after 5 years, but there was enough coordination and planning to create a memorial site of everyone who passed away?? (then I presume a dedicated committee/staff to maintain the memorial site grounds?)Why not use the time stone to just reverse time before the snap? Instead of traveling back in time and having to get every single stone. With the knowledge from the present, they could prevent the infinity war by just going back in time and destroying at least one infinity stone. the initial problem was their strategy; it was defensive by ""protecting the stones"". it should have been offensive. they now understand that at least one stone would need to be destroyed. how? well that's for the writer's of the movie to decide. SW cannot be the only person in all of MCU who has the power to destroy the stone. perhaps an opportunity to introduce an OMEGA mutant). either way, this scenario makes more sense than finding all the stones and then somehow magically making a new gauntlet.someone was arguing against reversing time because Stark did not want to change the present (ie Morgan). Ok, If that's the case, then he is still selfish. he would rather lose vision, gamora, and unknowingly BW in the process of obtaining the infinity stones? In addition, he dies himself. So 4 preventable deaths AT LEAST. this really negates his so called ""self-sacrifice"". He could still get married and have a child after correcting the events of infinity war. No sympathy for an un-evolved Tony Stark.There were some moving scenes (many occurring during the time travel segment) and I enjoyed the final battle. But there were far too many plot holes. I'm surprised ""die hard"" fans are incapable of critical thinking skills. I've watched youtube channels by devoted fans just to gain perspective but they're too caught up in the moment to critique it technically as a film."
2295,"This movie is a hectic and at sometimes confusing wrap up to 11 years of the Avengers. It's hard to see some of the characters that you love and have enjoyed for a decade leave the MCU. And perhaps watch the MCU end, with the PC comments coming out of marvel studios. It is heavily foreshadowed in the movie and honestly I have no interest in what's coming. However, me and my family thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Although it is not as good as Infinity War. Infinity war set the bar with story, pacing, action, and a cliffhanger that made you want to see endgame so bad that some people even went out to see that very average Captain Marvel movie. The best part about it was that they didn't let Captain Marvel ruin the movie. They let some things into this movie that 10 years ago they would never have. However, since it's the end I won't gripe about that. Good movie, it doesn't need any recommendations because everybody's going to see it. I enjoyed it."
2296,I felt the power of the six infinity stones. #stoned
2297,"I really did. The writers just continued to made changes to characters that were convenient for their story. Just like in Infinity War. And why such a spotlight on a single character, while others are barely seen in the movie. Too many plot holes, inconsistencies, and overall character changes. Disappointed :("
2298,"End Game, here it is, finally after all the hype, the Zenith has been reached. Yet, once the credits started to roll, I was shocked to realise that I felt hollow. It ties together all the previous films, but it lacks energy. Whereas Infinity War had you on your toes from start to finish, here interest starts with a bang, then whimpers along until finally the end of the 2nd act. I get that it's supposed to be an emotional film, but for the first two hours, it's relentless. You'd be forgiven to believe you were watching a Hallmark feature. Constant sombre music with constant sombre facials.The film does massive disservice to Thanos, whereas in the first film he is a constant danger to our heroes, here he is left behind the screening door. I understand why, it's because he had his limelight in Infinity War and that there was just too much story in End Game to give him screen time. Therein lies the problem, if the story that took his screen time away were great stories, all is forgiven, problem is, with the exception of one sub-plot, they are not. Don't even get me started with what happened to Thor.They should have spent more time in the writing room, because honestly you can remove a substantial amount of the first two hours and it will have no impact on the third act. Unlike Infinity War where you can re-watch it a bunch of times, the first two hours of End Game will be fast forwarded and only the last hour will be repeated. They spent upwards of $400m on this and honestly, I can't tell where that went. Infinity War, no debate, you can see where that money went, End Game? Not so much.I have a near graphic memory for films, I can repeat any memorable movie I have seen from start to finish, including dialogue. Films I am truly invested in, I can go as far as describing scenes in excruciating detail, where the coffee mug was left, how much coffee was left, if it was a warm or cold cup, the type and colour of the mug etc. It's a wasted talent, but when I struggle to recall what happened for those first two hours, something is not right. Don't get me wrong, it is a great film and it brings to the end over 45 hours of storytelling, but honestly, I expected a much bigger bang than this."
2299,Avengers endgame had very little story progress through the 3 hr run it had and it created so many plot-holes along the way.Time travel is a very tricky story element to implement into your franchise it can make or break the franchise. They even touch base on some of the flaws within the movie yet still happen to create said flaws making the end product into a paradox of itself. I can delve deeper into that but I would risk spoiling the movie.Aside from the paradox they created they didn't utilize Captain Marvel like they should have. In fact she was used more like a one trick pony recreating her final moments in her own movie and recycling it over to the finale of this movie. She was more of a cameo if anything.They had some great moments but those were few and far between. In fact within those 3 hours I can only remember maybe 3 to 4 minutes of quality scenes (not including any trailer footage) which makes these 3 hours drag.So for the final Avengers movie with some of these characters it was a bit disappointing. Definitely not the best marvel superhero movie ever nor an epic conclusion like some claim. Honestly the Captain Marvel movie was more enjoyable and that's not really that great. 6.5/10 for me
2300,"Avengers:Endgame lacks the pace that infinity war had and some defining moments and storylines may seem a bit stretched. But with stunning visuals, staggering emotions, incredible acts and a satisfying end makes it something to be experienced."
2301,Will tug on the old heart strings and will be one of the best movies you will ever see.
2302,"For the past 11 years MCU has been increasing their fan base across the globe with larger than life characters.
Avengers : End Game: With the expectations sky high, the Russo brothers delivered a fitting finale to this franchise.
What worked:
1. The emotions were very well connected with the audience.
2. Jaw dropping CGI and VFX.
3. The last battle.What could have been better:
1. Screenplay a bit slow.
2. The war sequence could have been a bit lengthier.Overall, this experience is for a life time and hence everyone should enjoy this wonder movie in IMAX"
2303,"No Spoilers review ?!
I think it would be rude to ask for a more better version of this story..To be honest There is no satisfying ending.. it's always what was best possible way.. Avengers End game makes you realise that your superhero whom you always considered Mentality of steel and Heart full of Power...They are also Human They deserved the life they wanted...And this movie is perfect capturing of what they could do with so less time left on their side...This movie is brilliant, unparalleled dedication..I am happy as well as sad to see this End of an era...But Eventually everything comes to end..So is the movie... Thank you Avengers ! For making our virtual and real world both happy 😊"
2304,"This movie has a lot of great things going for it. It has its typical mcu comedic charm despite the atmosphere of defeat. It definitely has things that will make you tear up a bit, especially compared to previous movies. The action, while in my opinion was scarce compared to previous movies, was still fun to watch.My biggest cons to the movie are the following:
1. Fat thor
2. Limited action scenes
3. Most of all, time travelFat thor was funny at first but I was really hoping he would whip into shape. Instead I just couldn't take him serious which is a shame because he's such a cool character.The action scenes just seemed to be resolved so quick. I was hoping this war would be an epic battle of like lord of the rings: the return of the king proportion. Instead we get a big build up, with quick resolution. I find it incredibly convenient that the whole squad works to get the new infinity gauntlet to the portal and even with captain marvels ability to fly it still lands next to thanos. I mean come on..Then there's the time travel. I wish I could list every single plot hole that comes along with time travel in this movie. A lot just doesn't make sense. Like why wouldn't simply bringing one stone to the future prevent anyone from disappearing in the first place? Thanos would never had completed the gauntlet. There's a multitude of other examples that just ruin it for me the more I think about other plot holes. It's a shame I think they built it up so well in infitity war. Time travel is such a cop out to resolve things, I hate that they had to use it here.But all in all this movie is definitely worth the theater visit. I enjoyed watching it, but when I read that it is getting tens? I think people are just giving it that out of the hype of the movie instead really critically thinking about its flaws."
2305,"I am a big MCU Fan, and watched each and every of them. Infinity Wars is 9/10, if not 10/10 ....Leaving the cinema, my immediate comparison was Skyfall v Spectre. I was also very disappointed about Spectre .... but this time, my feelings were more mixed.The good parts of the Endgame are many, of course, if you are a die hard MCU Fan. Eg, ""hail Hydra"", Peggy Carter, the jokes and fun (kind of resembling Regarnok but the latter is better), the recap of the different historical MCU movie scenes in the pretext of tracing the different stones. MCU Fans would love them, and so do I. It brings back a lot of fond memories I have had in the past 11 years and this is great for a finale.However, plot inconsistencies and illogical science aka time travel/Cap staying in the past etc just made me mad. The quantum realm can be better used to develop a much better, exciting plots without having too many inconsistencies and messes. The conversation between the Ancient One and Banner was so vague (ok, they can say that's a mix of science and myth and magic, fine ....) and if the Russo Brothers thought this can ""rationalise"" the whole inconsistent plots, they are undermining our intelligence. This is not an under 12 movie.The complete demolition of Hulk and Thor are disastrous. I guess they try to plot Thor into a funny and cartoon like character possibly to prepare for the GOTG3 ? But if not,, this is a complete disaster. Hulk doesn't get a revenge he deserves.There is a funeral for Iron Man, but how about Romanofff ? Romanoff also deserves some better treatment in the movie.Transponding Thanos' spacecraft from the past to the present is also totally unbelievable and defying logic. More elaboration as to what Nebula has done is needed. The past Gamora stocked in the future ? Are they really plotting for GOTG3 ??Another disappointing scene is Captain Marvel was beaten by Thanos without the stones - ok the last blast was because Thanos used the Power Stone, but otherwise it seems Thanos' power was too strong without the stones. This was not explained even at the Infinity War - as Thanos was already having the Power Stone (by destroying Xander) when they destroyed Thor and Loki at the opening scene. Last time at Titan the crew without Captain Marvel almost got Thanos (but for Star Lord), but this time with Thor and his new power, with Iron Man, Cap and Cap Marvel they were completely dismantled ! In the last fight scene which was quite messy (the opening was hilarious but that's all), Cap Marvel was blasted by the Power Stone but she's Cap Marvel .... since then she disappeared until the funeral ! That's why Iron Man was dead ....So many logic defying plots that I originally gave this 5/10 but the additional score was a compliment of a finale and an ending of an era. The movie nicely sums up what we have experienced in the last 11 years but I do expect something out of the box, something terrific, something more logical. MCU this time does not live up to my expectations !"
2306,"A cinematic masterpiece ,an allrounder.a movie which will be remembered for a very long time."
2307,Perfect ending to a great story that we have been lucky to see over the last decade
2308,"1. They emasculated the heck out of Thor
2. Captain America using the hammer and summoning lightning ruined it.
3. Pepper Pots putting armor on and Cpt Marvel girl power agenda was a bit much. Even my wife said so.
4. Any Joe Schmoe can hold an infinity stone now?
5. Falcon becoming the new CA is lame
6. Hulks part was kinda dumb
7. Shouldn't SpiderMan and most of his classmates all be 5 years apart in age now?"
2309,"I reccomed for those who didn't watch the movie but main problem of this movie is change of characters.
This behaviour and attitudes. Some people like it some didnt but if we ignore those its a good movie"
2310,"It was amazing!! Don't get me wrong.
But GOSH they packed this film... so I almost feel it was rushed to tie up all the loose ends!! Felt like it ""zoooomed"" by!Also, urghhhh I cannot help to feel that some characters were done in.Thor - why?? He was funny and all, but SJO the turn they made with him in this movie was a little sad!! Where's the Thor Ragnarok! I get he's had a rough past getting to this point, but eish. I do not think his character had a fair ending. And he was especially one of my alll along. So this ending for him was rough.Captain Marvel - could've featured more not just pop up everytime as the last hope! Her character seemed flat in this one and I actually loved her stand alone movie. So why release her movie RIGHT before this one, just for her to be forgotten - come onnnnnnnnn!!Fury - really, not even one word???Loki - not at least one reference???Capt america - not so much excited about falcon becoming capt america- but oh well I guess he will grow on me. Gonna miss Chris Evans, though!!!!Ironman - nope... will never get over it!!😢😢😢SO MANY PLOTHOLES.
My biggest peeve is that Thanos is suddenly SO strong (without the stones) that Capt Marvel cannot even stop him? Or he can suddenly stop Thor's new axe??? Really??? Come onnnnnnn.
And then Capt America is made the HERO with THOR's hammer?? It's quirky and all... but I would've accepted it easier if Thor was not made out to be such a big joke in this film already. So - not cool. He's actually quite epic and not what this film did with his character - haha maybe I am more peeved about Thor then I thought!! 🤣🤣Did feel it was very much and iron man / capt america movie- granted they are legit. But the other characters are just as strong!! Why undersell them. Oi.Oh well so all in all I cannot say I have a completely ""satisfied"" feeling in the end. It was good and I cried QUITE a bit!! Lol.So sad when something so legend has to end 😞"
2311,"I've been a fan of superheroes since I was little kid. When Iron Man was out, I couldn't believe it, it was so good. But, I completely fell in love with the idea of the MCU when I watched Captain America: The First Avenger.
Here we are, 10 years later, 10 years loving fictional characters, loving the actors, loving the movies, to have it ending like... well this.I think they had a great idea, a great way of saying goodbye to the most beloved characters, but I think the movie fell short. I was more emotional during the ending credits than the whole movie. I felt like I needed more, like there was many things left unsaid. Maybe I'll love it the second time I watched it? I don't know honestly, for now, I am a bit disappointed with this one."
2312,"EXCELLENT BETTER THAN INFINITY WAR !!!
BETTER THAN A LOT OF SUPERHERO MOVIES AND IT SEEMS MARVEL WINS !! WHEN ARE THEY MAKING BATMAN VS HULK???? COZ THAT WAS ACTUALLY A COMIC ,,GOOGLE IT !! AND JOACHIN PHOENIX AS THE JOKER IS MAKING ME KINDA HAPPY AND HOPEFUL FOR THE COMIC BOOK ART MOVIES THAT ARE SOMETIMES GREAT LIKE WATCHMEN AND DARK NIGHT and YES TO ENDGAMESTAN LEE WOULD BE PROUD OF ENDGAMENUFF SAID"
2313,I love this movie by the script by actress performances i follow the all avengers movie this movie is final movie with main avengers but i always remember my favorite main avengers and i am dam shore this movie break all Hollywood and Bollywood or any other film industry record love you my five main avengers i always remember you 🙏❤
2314,"This may the first movie where I loved maybe 98% of its scenes, but not the movie itself. A collection of great moments and even well-deserved fan-service does not mean a movie is good. Did I enjoy all the time-travel scenes and glorious interactions that led to? Yes! Do I still think time-travel of this scale is the worst idea in the MCU? Also yes.Why? Because the MCU's timeline is chock-full of crucial events and great threats overcome at great expenses. This time-travel is supposed to be different from what is normally portrayed or believed, yet they barely spent any time to explain it. Our seasoned Avengers just quickly assume absolutely nothing could go wrong if they change things and just jump into it?Also, those scenes while fun are the kind of scenes you expect to see in parodies or what-if scenario skits on talk-shows - not in the actual movie.
Thanos's quick initial death seems like the MCU trying to pull off a GoT by resorting to cheap shock-tactics. Unfit-Thor and the selfie-taking Professor Hulk are like good comedy bits I'd expect to see on Jimmy Kimmel or a HISHE parody video. Wasn't Cap dating Agent Carter's niece? When did he go back to pining for Peggy again? She moved on after Cap. There was a whole TV show about it. Talking of TV shows, I hear there is going to one with Peggy and Cap - I thought Evans wanted to stop playing Cap? How much of this story was decided by Disney's upcoming new streaming service? Finally, the whole time-travel arc obviously releases a whole another can-of-worms with questions and plot holes and inconsistencies etc. that I am not going to go into.I feel like the movie sacrificed its pace and good story-telling for moments such as this - Marvel movies were increasingly beginning to show a tendency of trying too hard to be funny at the expense of any story-telling impact and this really went too far.I wish the movie was different. I wish the time-jump was much shorter - maybe 6 months. That Thor was being the hero he is and helping people in the aftermath of the Decimation. That instead of altering (or something) all of the MCU timeline, they showed the whole world was falling apart after losing half of it and the Avengers were exhausted trying to patch things when they rollback time to 6 months ago and find a solution from there. I wish the movie ended happily with everyone intact. I wish I didn't leave the theatre feeling like I watched an expensive spoof."
2315,"I really enjoyed this film, how the time travel was a twist and how the film concluded etc.. However, my main issue with this film was the captain marvel aspect of it. The end credit scene for infinity war was of course nick fury reaching out to her before he turns to dust, showing that she would be crucial in endgame, and that she would play a major role in it, however she doesn't really do much in my opinion. I believe she only got around 15 minutes of screen time which makes no sense to me. Then they make her film which I know a lot of people didn't enjoy but I really liked it and it got me very hyped for endgame, so I was assuming we'd see her introduction to the avengers and other characters in endgame. In the end credit scene of captain marvel, where steve and natasha are talking about the pager that nick fury used to signal to captain marvel, and she appears and says ""where's nick??"" When I saw this I assumed this was a scene from endgame and then in endgame we'd see them being like ""oh who are you?"" and them explaining to each other who they are, what happened etc..
I thought we'd see much more interaction and interplay between her and the other characters, and them explaining the devastation that happened but they barely spoke to her. She should have been in the movie more, not as a main character or to steal the spotlight or anything like that, but I feel she could have been part of the time travelling scenes, she could have easily helped them and gone back in time with one of the teams. I just really did not like that she just appeared at the start of the movie, then disappears then returns at the end, and I did not like how they set her up as a powerful character in her own movie and then isn't in most of the film. I feel as if it was wasted potential.
Other little things that bothered me were why didn't nebula tell them the price of the soul stone, the hulk we know and love basically wasn't in it (or infinity war actually), time travelling confusion, pacing etc..
Other than the captain marvel issue and those little things, I enjoyed the film a lot, however I feel it could have been better and it had the potential to be a 10/10 film."
2316,"Couldnt help feeling that Endgame is to Infinity Wars what Dark Knight Rises was to Dark Knight.A good follow up but the bar was already set too high. Very entertaining, with a satisfying ending, but got there after quite a few plot holes and unanswered questions.It felt like the writers wrote the ending first and then tried really hard to take us to that end, regardless of what plot holes they were forced to leave in the wake.PS didn't really like what they did to Thor and Hulk. Good for laughs maybe, but the characters deserved better"
2317,"I was super hyped for Avengers: Endgame after the fantastic Avengers: Infinity War last year. I always wondered ""How were they going to top it?"" so what was the result after sitting in a cinema for almost 3 hours? I came out a little underwhelmed, honestly. I must stress that I don't think Endgame is a bad movie by any means, it's just the bar set by Infinity War was so high for me that all the shortcomings and issues I had with Endgame made me feel like it was the weaker half of the story by quite a significant amount in comparison.One thing I really noticed in Endgame was the pacing and structure of the movie was all over the place. There were weird tangents in the story that didn't really go anywhere and were just used as a quick gag or fan service. Compared to Infinity War where everything flowed so smoothly, it felt to me Endgame's writing was quite sloppy in places. The jokes were not hitting quite as well, and characters were acting differently just for the sake of a contrived moment or joke to occur. Without spoiling anything, Thanos for example seems completely different in Endgame to what he was in Infinity War. There were just so many moments where characters were acting un-natural, that it was distracting.As for the characters and emotional moments, Captain Marvel honestly might as well never have been in this movie. She barely does anything. Iron Man and Captain America get the most screentime for a good reason and have nice conclusions. The Hulk feels toned down here alot and left to the sides. Thor is mostly comic relief here, so if you never found Thor: Ragnarok funny, you might hate him big time here. The others have shared screentime and you do see alot of characters in this movie. It does have a big finale feel to it, and there are many nice references to previous Marvel movies in there too. If you've seen Back to the Future: Part II, that's basically how the Time Travel stuff works. Just try not to think about it too much, otherwise the inconsistencies might annoy you.Overall, I still had a blast with Avengers: Endgame. I was never bored despite the lengthy running time. However, the reason why I felt a little let down, despite still liking it, is that re-watching Infinity War just the night before was close to perfection at telling that side of the story. The sequence of events, the humour, the emotional beats, and the characters all acted at their very best in Infinity War. Endgame to me, felt like a noticeable drop in quality despite the grandness and scale of it acting as a swan song to the MCU Universe. I'm not sure where Marvel can go from here. They've pretty much done the most epic Comic Book Superhero movie storyline they could have ever done, so what's next?7.5/10"
2318,"Off the bat I'm going to say I loved the film. It made me laugh, made me cry and felt like a proper ending to what has been an amazing saga! The final battle scene was simply fantastic (as you would expect) and it was probably the most well acted out of all the Marvel movies.That being said, I think I preferred Infinity War (I'll need to see Endgame again and potentially update my review)I loved what they did with depressed Thor, making him a fat drunk, it was funny and clever..... however, the fact that this god, the most powerful avenger remained that for the rest of the movie really irked me and the more I think about it the more it's annoying me. He should have got back to his usual self at some point before the end battle.Also, the girl power scene during the battle. I'm all for empowered women but it was quite ridiculous and felt like they added it about 3 months after finishing the movie, and for those reasons it loses 3 points from me 7/10.It could be that we've only just been spoiled with infinity war that I'm not giving this the 10 it could well deserve and like I say, I will watch it again in the next few weeks and reevaluate."
2319,"No spoilers here!I'll keep it short and sweet, it's a solid film and I enjoyed it, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. Would I reccomend you go and see it? Of course! You should just keep your expectations within reason."
2320,"This looks to be a bit unpopular opinion but here goes: Endgame couldn't hold the standards of Infinity War, and felt a little bit too silly at start.**What I liked:**Doctor Hulk. I was really waiting for his appearance, I loved that they brought the character in. I just wish he had more action going on, and would've started smashing with Bruce's intelligence.Time-traveling scenes: These scenes were so good. Going back to older films, you recognize the scenery and re-live the moments in another perspective. Bruce talking about Dr.Strange with the Ancient one, and Tony meeting up with his father were ultimately the best scenes of the movie.Captain America wielding Mjölnir. This was the climax of the film for me personally. The fight the Avengers had between Thanos only was pure eye/lore candy. I wish more Avengers had a bit more personal scenery with Thanos, thus this is the one that mostly was left on my mind.Tony stealing the infinity stones, and wielding them on his hand was a breathtaking and satisfying scene.Lots of scenes with Hawkeye. He felt a bit irrelevant on earlier films, but they actually presented him quite strong in this one. Very well received from my part.There was also lot of small details, but the one I liked the most was with Dr.Strange. At the end, right before Tony gets the stones, he looks at Stephen and Stephen is showing 1 with his fingers, implying this is the 1 in the 14 million chance. You could see Stephen's finger shaking from the accident he had.
**What I didn't like:**With Infinity War, I could feel tension through out the whole movie, the movie itself was a masterpiece. Here though, after the initial events of Infinity War, the buildup before time traveling felt utterly filler-y to me.Thor's started finally to shine in Ragnarok and Infinity War, and they made him silly comical relief. I felt like they went too much with it and it didn't really bring me enjoyment watching this character.Doctor Hulk wasn't introduced at all, and for the casual viewers with no information about comics might be a bit confused. I think showing Banners and Hulk's merging would've been much better screen time to what we saw.In the final battle, we had way too much side heroes / characters which really killed my emotional attachment. In Infinity War, we had many scenes showing most of the main heroes fight, and those scenes gave me shivers. However, apart from couple good moments, I didn't have those feelings like I had in Infinity War.Leading up to Tony's death, I wasn't as emotionally invested as in Infinity War's climax, thus I didn't cry. I don't think the scene itself was worse than IF's climax, but it was just the fact that a I felt a lot more disconnected to the film.Cpt.Marvel is too OP. Her entrance just killed all the tension as it became obvious, and not even close to who is going to be the winner here.
**Conclusion**I rated Infinity War 10/10. I think this film didn't really live up to the hype I had, was a bit filler-y at times and was just too cluttered with too many side-heroes at the ending battle. My honest personal subjective opinion is going to be 8/10."
2321,"First off, the things I liked:
The fight scenes were great, every single second of the final battle was thrilling and exciting.
The fan service. It was a great payoff of 11 years of character development, and it shows.
CGI was really good for almost all the movie.
Now the things I didn't like:
The jokes were really out of place, and the timing was off, something really rare about marvel.
Thor was a running joke for almost the whole film. After infinity war, where Thor was one of the most enjoyable characters to watch, this new fat Thor felt really forced, out of place and he constantly acted like a coward."
2322,"If you think you have figured it out all yet you haven't, amazing ending to the greatest saga, 3 hours have passed like it was an hour, the humor is there, the tears, the powerful visuals, won't say much, every person has to see it. Amazing amazing amazing"
2323,"EndGame is an epic finale to one of the greatest infinity saga. God the movie is fantastic!!!
I laughed, i cried and i cheered for the movie.
I wont write much or spoilers would come out of my mouth. Its all what marvel fans have been waiting for. I will write another review after Monday so that my review can be filled with Spoilers!!!"
2324,"This is a historic movie. The story that Marvel and Disney crafted for over a decade comes to its conclusion in an epic 3-hour film that is for the ages.All the characters, some of which we've known and loved for years and others we just met, get their share of love and their time to shine, with cheers and applause ensuing several times. There were tears aplenty, but also quite a few laugh, in particular from a character you don't usually think of as comic relief. The movie takes time to show us the unbearable loss of Infinity War and how the Avengers each deal with it, before a way to bring back all of the victims of the Snap appears. But don't think you know how this is going to go because whenever you think THAT was the big twist, there's probably another one coming.New abilities are revealed, emotional arcs are fulfilled and heroes change as Marvel lays the ground work for its next phase that will officially start after the release of Spider-Man: Far from Home this summer. Endgame ends with an open door to the MCU's future, but for the first time since its beginning, the movie does not feature a post-credit scene, leaving us wondering what's to come.I feel like this is the kind of movie I'll be happy to say I saw in the theater the day it came out 30 years from now when they remake it for the third time. This is a once in a generation cultural phenomenon and I hope you go see it in the theatre because you will not regret it."
2325,The best MCU movie i've ever seen. And I could not control my sobbing during certain scenes which I am not going to spoil it here just for you guys. You all have to see this!!!!!!! A must watch.
2326,Best movie i just love it. It the best movie of the decade i guess everyone reading this must watch this movie.
2327,"Let's talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility."
2328,"This movie had me crying so much after seeing it but it also very awesome. When Cap lifted Thor's hammer I was shocked and geeking out over it. I was also geeking out when Spider-Man came back cause his death was the saddest in Infinity War. But I am really sad that Iron Man will not be doing anymore Marvel movies, I am excited to see what Robert Downey Jr. has planned for the future."
2329,"Going into the movie with high hopes, came out astonished, kudos to the people making this movie a wonderful thing!"
2330,"Walt Disney Pictures most anticipated movie of the year did not disappoint. Without spoiling the movie too much, this Marvel Studios film directed by the Russo Brothers was nearly a cinematic masterpiece. However, there were a few things that that drop it a level or two from being 10 out of a 10. The main one is the overuse of story convenience & plot armor. There is way too many Deux Ex Machina moments in the redemption journey of the Avengers team figuring out, how to undo the effects of Thanos' (Motion Capture & Voice Acting by Josh Brolin) actions from the last movie 2018 'Infinity War' that really took me out of the story. One of them is the whole rescue of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) in outer space. It was not needed as most of the media trailers already spoil that Stark was able to make it back to Earth. Not only that, but it was a bit jarring & little too hard to believe that Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) was able to find a small ship in the vast cosmos. That scene didn't really belong in the movie. The film could have used that time to explore the depths of Thor (Chris Hemsworth) depression and trauma. It was a bit much to see the God of Thunder reduce into an over the top comedy relief character. The writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely should have treat his extreme lost in a nuanced and meaningful way. They could had cut back a little bit on the laughs involving him. As for the other sequences of the Avengers dealing with their post snap despair. It was fine for the most part, even if it's a bit slow. I just wish the world that they live in, should had been more chaotic & apocalyptic dystopia. Nevertheless, clocking in at three hours and one minute runtime, this twenty-second film entry of the Marvel Cinematic Universe was already a very long watch. It really needed better pacing. It had too many 1989 'Back to the Future Part 2"" time travel type scenarios & recycled footage callbacks. Some of them, are not that interesting, such as the Asgard trip. Those scenes could had been more compelling, if the setting were changed to them going to the Collector's hideout in Knowhere during the events of 2014's 'Guardian of the Galaxy'. Plus, the story would had been more compact as the Power & Reality Stones were at the same place. Nevertheless, others time travel moments like the one in the 1970s were not really needed, when you think about it. Don't get me wrong, it was a very emotional moment for Tony Stark to meet his dad, but, much of that time, could had been used to establish tears for other characters, such as the tragic love story between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson). Natasha kinda got the short straw here. After all, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Widow's skills in stealth and deception would have been better suited with any other mission. The superhuman demigods should had explore Vormir. Nevertheless, the time travelling sequences were highly entertaining. I just wish they focus a little more on establishing the David Deutsch rules how it honestly works, because where it stands. It's highly complicated & confusing. There is a lot of inconsistencies & contradictions that really stands out. Most of them, involves past versions of characters coming to the prime timeline future, & Captain America (Chris Evans) actions toward the end. Even Ant Man (Paul Rudd) being able to use endless amount of Pym particles is somewhat not coherent. I hate that the writers brush those unanswered plot holes off, because I really curious, on how Steve Rogers honestly return those stones back in their time periods without screwing up time even worst or getting caught. Those unseen moments could had been really interesting action scenes. Regardless, the ones we do witness, were fine, even if they were CGI heavy. There is just a few nitpicks. The Sanctuary II ship opens fire point-blank with all its cannons on the Avengers base until it's nothing but a smoldering crater but it doesn't even manage to injure, never mind kill, any of the people inside is really hard to believe. Those who do die, are somewhat predictable. Also, Carol Danvers's big rescue in the end, really does make the character, nothing more than a dull shrew, walking Deux ex Machina. To make it worst, there was a very phony put in political progressive movement message in Endgame's climax that pays tribute to the women of Marvel that really doesn't fit. It seem awkwardly push as fan service rather than fitting within the logistic of that scene. While, the movie does jump around, a lot; nearly every scene was a very heart pounding experience built on fine heroic. The goods outweigh the bad. Surprisingly, the movie gave, enough screen time to, nearly all the marvel characters, without, turning into a giant mess of a film. Nearly every performer, including the cameos in this movie did a great job. As for the humor, it was fine. Lots of hilarious moments for a surprisingly dark film. The music score by composer Alan Silvestri is beautiful to listen to. In the end, it will be very interesting to see what dangers, a universe without the infinity stones will bring. Hopefully the new crop of heroes can indeed stop them. Can't wait for Phrase 4. Until then, this entry in the MCU is worth repeat viewings. It's highly recommended. This movie entertain us with enough to overlook all the flaws. It's really is, a must watch. It's marvelous."
2331,"When the plot and storyline is weak, movie makers rrsort to great publicity. This is precisely what Endgame is all about. No fizz just gas."
2332,I love you 3000 time. it was an amazing movie. i enjoyed it alot .................
2333,I'm no reviewer of films but just my two cents! That was amazing! It was the perfect way to end a 22 film cycle that will never be done again and that is why it gets a 10 from me.
2334,I love this movie. ..hope there will be another one like this
2335,"Everyone went crazy because all the heroes who were snapped came back with there armies to beat thanos' army and ironman got the infinity stones then said ""I am ironman"" and clicked his fingers and all the villians turn into dust,even thanos' but iron sadly died.tears came out of my eyes and now is pepper Potts,happy Hogan and Tony and pepper's daughter and also pepper had her own ironman suit.professor hulk was in the movie and didn't die,Hawkeye got his family back,Thor is fat and he is a team member of the guardians of the galaxy, black widow sacrifice her self to get the soul stone,war machine didn't die, ant Man is with his family and Captain America gave his shield to falcon and went to the 19s to dance with Peggy and that was the end of the movie. The movie is about time travel to get the infinity stones to prevent thanos' snap. R.I.P ironman 2008-2019.never forget this genius play boy."
2336,Infinity war was way better. Infinity war was way better.
2337,The Best MCU film ever made. The 22nd movie of Marvel Cinemastic Universe have done loyality for all the anticipation of marvel fans. Every marvel fan will be heartbroken after seeing the movie. It is a must watch
2338,"First of I only give it an 8 for what it is about and what it tries to do , a fun , enjoyable movie as all marvel films are . That said of course I disagree with it being a top 5 movie of all time , it doesn't even reach top 100 for me . But I always treated marvel movies in a different way because it would be unfair to compare it to far better films in many ways .
That out of the way , what I liked about Endgame is what I always liked about marvel movies , it is entertaining , the CGI is fantastic , the action is cool , the humor is good for the most part , last battle was great . So many things to like and enjoy about Endgame .
For the part that most people disagree about which is the first hour and a half . For me I liked what the Russo brothers tried to do , to humanize the characters and to show grief and how they are dealing with the aftermath , but for some reason it felt long and at the same time rushed ( I know it does not make sense ) like the whole Thor thing which was solved by beer ? it worked for Tony Stark and Captain America the best I guess , but stuff like the whole Hawkeye/Ronin thing was out of place , Rocket felt unnecessary in this movie , this whole Hulk thing I didn't get as well . So I appreciate the effort to make the characters more human but it did not work for all of them.
Now the deaths , I wasn't expecting Black Widow's death but I don't think I cared that much , for Iron man I know many people expected it , for me I didn't but I wasn't shocked , it was well done though and a great ending for his character.
So overall even with my complaints , it wasn't bad in any way , and you should watch it , I think ."
2339,"This was truly the first time that as I was watching, I felt like I immediately recognized a movie's future significance. The duology of Infinity War and Endgame, I believe, will be remembered as the pinnacle of superhero movies. That's all there is to it."
2340,"To witness the end of this legendary franchise is bittersweet. This movie makes one cry, laugh, smile, think, cheer, worry, and imagine. It is perfection. Everything from acting, directing, sound effects, and storytelling is flawless. I watched it twice already and I am eager to watch it again."
2341,"I wish I could rate 100/10. Wow, and seriously wow....!!! This is probably first time I have cried in a movie theatre."
2342,"Avengers Endgame Review
Score - 10/10
Avengers Endgame could be well described as the most complicated storyline in the entire Marvel history not only because it had to wrap up a story of eleven years but also because of the complex solution to an inevitable situation that The Avengers try to achieve with the avenging not being the major part of the story.
The three hour runtime was well utilized by giving more time to establish the characters' humanistic attachments and the losses they suffered; not only in this movie, but from the very moment they've been incepted into this franchise.
Unlike the previous outings, the characters differ in their choices and these contrasts in their choices lead up to one massive and satisfying final battle which may not end the entire MCU, but certainly does end a glorious era of the long franchise.
The entire movie, especially the final battle was a huge fan service as it included everything a Marvel fan could possibly dream of.
PS: There is no Post - Credits Scene in the film, but it is worth waiting for the entire credits to roll."
2343,"NO SPOILERS
First off, the timeline in this movie is flawless. The absolute best, most coherent and consistent time travel use in any movie. The complaints in these reviews completely misunderstood how it worked.Second, the other complaint is Thor. Was he weaker? Yeah. Was I disappointed? Yeah, but it follows the progression of his character. He lost his whole family, swore revenge, almost saved the day and missed it by a foot. His demise into self loathing makes perfect sense and allows other characters to shine in battles. Thor tends to be overpowered so this leveled the playing field.Third, the pacing is slow and ponderous. But it asks you to follow the characters and their emotions and reactions to the snap. The slow pace allows the characterization to shine and not be overblown by tedious fighting like some scenes in Infinity War.Overall, I don't get people's desire for overpowered characters with aimless action scenes. Endgame does a great job creating small moments for personality and giving everyone a chance to shine in battle."
2344,"So Dr. Strange saw 1 in 14 billion possibilities that a rat operating antman's Vehicle after 5 years which has probably dead battery 🤣 are you kidding me?!
After watching all MCU movies, I still feel the studio guys haven't learned anything about characters consistency. There are many illogical scenes which me think it's not my cup of tea. The ending doesn't add up, should I forget the scene between a Steve Rogers and Sarah Carter in civil war? He just ends with Peggy Carter?. Where is Sarah Carter? What was captain marvel doing in the entire movie? She shows up in the beginning and end. Captain Marvel can't handle the power of Thanos power but Tony Stark can snatch away all the stones? It's silly and goofy. How come Captain America wield the Thor's hammer? This whole travel was poorly handled like a B grade movie.
These ratings are stupid marvel fanboys who don't use their brains.
I liked Iron man solo movies but these avengers movies are dumb and illogical."
2345,"Probably good enough. I'd say not any better or worse than infinity war.
A few things:1) Why was Thor the absolute worst version of himself? They completely ruined him the whole movie.2) How did Captain America gain the ability to use Thor's hammer?3) The Hulk - also the worst version of himself.Messy end fight scene, Captain Marvel was a total novelty, Thanos made several fair points.How is Thanos stronger than a spaceship idk.The 'Girl Power' scene made me audibly groan in the cinema. Unnecessary."
2346,"A bittersweet taste has been left in my brain: 2+ hours of sentimental, cheesy dialogues, 15-20 of pure, hardcore action, 3 hours total. I was really confused. Kinda enjoyed this ending, although way far from an epic one."
2347,From the beginning to end the movie is perfect!!!!
2348,"After seeing all the 22 movies and some of them even twice I have to say that the last movie of the MCU was perfectly balanced in every aspect. Full of passion, drama, funny scenes, action... it has it all! An almost flawless scenario that left me stumbled by its depth and ode in logike.
This scenario along with the coordination of the Russo Brothers (another proof that brotherhood collaboration excels) truly inspired all actors involved for a great performance. All these years of participations in different movies also enable them all to surpass themselves in acting. That's the success on the MCU in my opinion along with a clearly anthropocentric approach to the character of its heroes .Of course with such an amount of actors playing there will have been some cliques projected more during the film, but their unification under one roof was excellent. Thumbs up also for actor's discretion on leaks on the script.To be honest after I watched with much anticipation Avengers Infinity War in which I have to say I expected more in terms of fights among characters like in the comic books (maybe I was biased due to the numerous action-based trailers), I was prepared for a good but not special endgame.
But on the contrary as Red Skull would say
""We all think we were prepared.. we were all wrong!""A mind elevation for children, a new dimension of sentimental fulfillment for adults..
Best entertaining three hours I had in years! I just wish we had even some more!
Especially in the movie's action scenes, I had such goosebumps only from classic trilogy like Wachowski Bros Matrix or in the Star Wars clone war.Must SEE 10/10."
2349,"It's fantastic and beautiful
It's fantastic and beautiful
It's fantastic and beautiful
It's fantastic and beautiful
It's fantastic and beautiful"
2350,"I loved the movie and i only have two problems with it. They ""nerfed"" Thor way too much, I get it, he haven't been fighting for the last 5 years, but why didn't he fly up and destroy the Centauri ships of thanks ship when he's shooting at them. Captain marvel is strong.. we didn't need the ""strong female moment"" it REALLY ruined an otherwise good second meeting with captain marvel.. please just make it normal and not ""oh hey look, we're treating women with respect"" this is the opposite you're getting out of it..
this is the only problems I had with the movie otherwise amazing.. had to hold in a tear or two."
2351,"It has been, a little under eleven years since I saw the first iron man movie with my dad in the movie theater, at the time none of us really could imagine what was in store for us. the infinity saga is one of the most complex stories I have ever seen strung together within the cinematic universe. Endgame has everything I could have asked for, humor, plot twists, world-class acting, life lessons, heartbreak, and most importantly closure, and although not all of them are great, I am certain that I one day will make my kids watch the entire saga in the hopes that they will find them as special as we did.To The Russo brothers, Kevin Feige, Stan Lee, and all the other geniuses behind this amazing adventure, Thank you for telling us your story."
2352,"The second the iconic Marvel intro began, I was crying buckets. By far the best super hero film of all time. A complete finish to the most epic saga. Bring two buckets... one for your popcorn and one for your tears."
2353,"Avengers endgame is kind of a ""sweet gift"" from marvel studios to all marvel fans around the world who have been faithful in terms of following the franchise since it was released first on 2008.10 years of workhard, never dissapointing. Avengers endgame is a kind of a ""indirect communication"" between the director and the fans, on how thankful they are for having them.Avengers endgame, undoubtly, is a work made by heart."
2354,"I have been giving thoughts if I should still write about Avengers: Endgame. My brain is just blacked out. I cannot think of anything. Maybe because the movie left me broken after seeing it. And I'm afraid that if I try to remember the scenes from the movie, I might end up crying.I felt sad after watching Infinity War, but Endgame just rips your heart out.I was very silent after the movie. I went straight home after watching it. I can't handle it. I just watched the most anticipated movie of 2019 and the excitement and anticipation were replaced with too many emotions that is very impossible to contain. I thought I was ready to watch it, but I wasn't.I haven't written a review that doesn't contain spoilers, so I would like this to be different. And it's really hard to write without spoiling the movie if the very core of the movie is how we are attached to the characters all over these years. We have been rooting for them for too long and seeing the conclusion of the franchise is giving us mixed emotions. All good feelings, I assure you but as I mentioned too much to contain.I will watch it again, not to be broken again, but because this movie might be our last connection to the characters we ever love. (You'll know when you see the movie.)I'm sending this warning to all MCU fans who haven't seen it. Be very ready for every possible and impossible thing that might happen because this movie will give you an emotional blow. You will clap. You will jump. You will shout. You will cheer. You will cry. And heck, you will weep. I know I did. #AvengersEndgame #EndgameReview"
2355,"Believe me, in 3 hours I didn't blink my eye. There are few visual glitches despite story telling, direction and everything that give you full 3000 times satisfaction."
2356,Amazing. Enjoy the roller coaster. A perfect conclusion to this story arc. 3000/10
2357,I am a huge fan of marvel. And I was pretty sure that this movie will be legend. And to me it is LEGEND.Scenes was awesome. The scenario was awesome.I think every marvel fan should watch this movie...
2358,"I'm not disappointed bcz of its sad ending, it's just the problem I have with some parts of the film.
where went the romance between Bruce and Nat. when there comes some thing like a feeling in the scripts, the audience expect to see the expansion of it. but here this part totally became forgotten!when Cap went to the past to return the stones, where he put the Soul Stone?! it's not clear how he returned it! gave it to Red Skull? not logical!Cap left the Avengers Team for Peggy? he didn't seem that kind of guy before! he mourned for Peggy and had it in his mind as a good memory, but then he left the team for her and that's a big irresponsibility that we never saw in him before.was it really essential to ruin the Mighty Thor to this level? what help gave his new appearance and behavior to the movie line? just to prevent him wear the gauntlet?why Tony and Nebula who were aware of the way the Soul Stone can be achieved( by knowing that Thanos achieved it by murdering Gamora) didn't say anything about it when the team was doing some researches about the stones? is it logical?"
2359,"Infinity War was a solid, cohesive movie. Endgame manages to mess up everything Infinity war got right. You might say that ""It's really difficult to do such a thing with this many characters."" Infinity War had more than twice the amount of characters and was really good. Thor is no longer one of the coolest and powerful Avengers. He has been reduced to a fat, wimpy drunk. He almost killed Thanos when he had the Infinity Gauntlet but can barely touch him without. Speaking of Thanos, he has become the generic bad guy with no motive other than ""destroy the Avengers."" Captain America's send off was dissapointing, out of character, and did not follow the rules of time travel the movie had set. Why would Captain America neglect to do any super-heroing and just be with Peggy? How is it possible that he changed the future andn appeared as an old man when you cannot change the future through time travel? He should have had the heroic death Tony had, and given Tony the happily ever after. Also, did Steve just erase the husband and children Peggy had from existence? The final battle was just a bunch of CGI schlock. We could have seen all of the Avengers battle Thanos, rather than having entire armies fight the outriders. Captain Marvel may have been even worse in this movie than before, and the whole feminism message was extremely on the nose and painful to watch."
2360,"Everything that's happened over the past 11 years has been leading to this, and it's all put together beautifully. In my opinion, there are 3 movies to rewatch before watching Endgame: Iron Man 1, Winter Soldier, and Infinity War."
2361,This movie is absolutely amazing. I enjoyed almost every part of the amazing journey. Much better then infinity war and it truest lives up to the incredible hype it created over time. 10/10 would recommend.
2362,"Had some really good twists, overall awesome 3 hours!"
2363,Best avengers series am gonna miss them everyone should watch this
2364,"When I was a kid(I was 12),I remember when I watched Iron Man for first time and I didn't know that is the start of MCU. Then,3 years later I find out whats going on. I can't belive It is over now. Tony Stark was a hero in every movie,he always have to do ""the right thing"". In the New York he was who risk it all,and then in Infinity war he goes to space to protect the world. He is TRULY HERO of the MCU! It is so sad beacause he left his beloved wife and daughter behind to save the universe. I am sad beacuse he is gone(small part of me hope he will come back from past and live his life with family) but that is the way it had to be. I am also happy on the second hand that he was willing to die for everbody. It stared with "" I am ironman"" and that is how it end. Every journery has an end. Thank you Marvel Studio, it was beautiful journery,I can't wait to watch it one day with my children.
I don't want to make other characthers less worthy,I think they all was amazing but I want to give this honour to Tony.
Enjoy the movie guys 🌌"
2365,"Just very satisfied, very entertained, and very much wanting to see it again and again! Also, very happy to have been a part of the whole saga and very much wanting to share this experience with our grandkid. What a ride!"
2366,"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless.
The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten.
Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts!
There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist.
There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.
They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance.
There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years."
2367,"This movie past over and beyond any expectation. Don't miss watching it..... will definitely watch it again and again. ""Endgame"" The name fits perfectly.
Total respect"
2368,"So - it's trash. Cap is like top 5 least useful avengers. If Thor wasn't drunk and if Captain Marvel made it onto the screen during the last two hours if would have been a very short movie. Time travel sucks. So basically if anyome wants to get into MCU just watch this trash and it will be like you watched it all cause nothing really happened from the movies before because of time travel. Still a 4, i liked the asguardians of the galaxy pun"
2369,This movie is totally worth watching! It made me both laugh and cry multiple times
2370,"I'll start by saying before Infinity War, I always thought that most Marvel films were a 6 or 7 out of 10 for me, they were all enjoyable, however the thing they so drastically lacked was a strong baddie.
My issue with the first Avengers was Loki being so non threatening, and everyone I talk to about this seems to agree, however the breakthrough at the time was just to have all their heroes on screen together.
You then had Avengers Age of Ultron, which had the baddie being a creation of Tony Stark, which I found unexciting, despite it being a fun watch.
The two impressive Captain America sequels, the third of which had our heroes fighting against each other, again something I found to be a little underwhelming.Then came Infinity War, which for me totally raised the bar, and properly introduced one of the most threatening, and in my opinion Iconic baddies we have seen on the screen since Nolans Bane in TDKR. I was extremely dissapointed to not see more people dressed up as the mad titan last Halloween (no shortage of Harley Quinns and Jokers still).
Infinity War ended with what is unquestionably the greatest shock in superhero film history, which then set up what promised to be a fascinating follow up.This film did not disappoint, and even if you are not a fan of superhero movies in general, I would strongly urge any film fan to at least watch both Infinity War and Endgame both. I am certain even the most hard nosed film critic (the type that boo every film at Cannes) can appreciate the quality of film-making on display here.I have seem some passionate YouTubers making videos about plot-holes being uncovered throughout this film, however given the direction the story took, I can imagine the difficulty the filmmakers had weaving this all together, and I am confident they did the best they could.
Essential viewing."
2371,"Ignoring the girl power escene, the movie is perfect. Avenger Assemble!"
2372,"This movie was a great conclusion to the last 11 years of the MCU. You will laugh, you will cheer and you will even cry. This movie takes multiple unexpected turns. When this movie unfolds you surprisingly get to learn more about the characters that survived the Snap. MCU took a different style of storytelling which was very risky for a marvel movie, but they pulled it off. If you are thinking of watching this movie, I strongly recommend that you stay away from as many spoilers as possible. Trust me, the less you know about the movie the more you will love it. Go see it ASAP. I love it 3000."
2373,"If you're a follower of the MCU like myself then you don't need to read any reviews to convince you to watch this movie, it's the culmination of years of movies and a must see for fans.
It's Filled with epic, emotional, sad and funny moments with tons of details for those who have been following all the previous movies, It's what you'd expect from a movie with this caliber and more.
I'm excited to see what the future holds for MCU and if it's going on with the same execution as this one then i'll be really satisfied."
2374,"Don't enter the theatre with preconceived notions of what you wanted them do do with this movie, no. Instead let it unfold as Infinity Wars did, an unexpected storm. This movie was epic, the acting, the cinematography, the story, the mixture and combinations of joy, pai, and suspense...all the years of a finally woven Marvel heroic tapestry. Finished. But in a way that leaves me yearning for more, but relishing the memories of the characters I once simply read about as a child from the 60s to seeing them in the big screen like never before. Man this was a great movie! A must see. Hollywood Oscar folks time to stop overlooking these cinematic treasures. There were some Oscar worthy performances in here. Phase was of the age of marvelous Marvel heroes hit it crescendo. And it was one for the ages!"
2375,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10"
2376,"10 years, 22 movies has come to an end.This movie provides laughter tears and joy. It is the perfect ending for most of the characters and a New beginning for Some. If this movie doesnt get an award im stumped.Thanks for making this movie. And i am hopefull for the future of the MCU."
2377,"It's a great closure.
Epic as people called it.
Heroes.."
2378,"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5"
2379,"Bad avengers ever, bad script, 😡
Stay home insted"
2380,"Marvel has completely taken over the film industry, and the addition of this film will speed up that process even more. This film is enjoyed the most when the audience is knowledgeable of the marvel cinematic universe and it enhances the emotions of the audience due to the bond forged through the commitment of watching all 21 films before Endgame. If someone were to ask me: ""Is it one of the best films you have ever seen?"" I would reply: ""It is the best film if all time, in its own way"" ""Its stands alone, away from every other film, because it is so different to anything i have ever watched before."""
2381,Avengers: Endgame was mindblowing and awesome. It is the best MCU movie ever. It is even better than Avengers: Infinity War and it exceeded my wildest expectation.
2382,"Best Superhero Movie Ever You Will Cry, Laugh, And In The End Of The Movie You Will Be Shocked.You Must Watch It"
2383,"This is such an epic movie! You will get everything in this movie. Fun, emotion, love, what is not in the move! This is such a great ending! I just love this movie and cried when watching this..."
2384,"I know that this is the end of an era but I didn't like somethings on this movie:
Fat Thor;Captain Marvel: where was she? She just appeared in some specific times;Where is Captain Marvel's cat? hahaThey tried to be funny everytime;Things were so easy to be done: I mean ant man told Tony about the time travel and Tony found out a way really fast and easy. Why he didn't think about it earlier? I mean I thought ant man would be the key for it, I mean using him because he was in the quantum realm for long time, maybe he could get some energy or something like that... but no, Tony created everything, so ant mas was useless;the movie was too long, some scenes cut be shorter;no after credit scenes: I think it would be great having scenes for the next movie;nebula killed herself and didn't disappear;they changed the past lots of times: Loki disappeared, Thor's mother.In general I liked the movie but I prefer Infinity war."
2385,"""Perfect"" is the only thing I can say. Could not imagine a better ending."
2386,"This movie will make u laugh , goose bumps and cry. The plot and the climax is insane. Good jobb Russo brothers for making us feel this way. What a perfect way to end an era. #hatsoff"
2387,*SPOILER ALERT*Korg plays Fortnite with Miek. Also Professor Hulk dabs.
2388,"A full circle. Good mix of action and emotion with the characters. Made everyone in the screening laugh out loud, sob and cheer."
2389,"Amazing movie, satisfies every question possible! It made me cry 😥😥 10/10"
2390,"Absolutely loved the Endgame. A perfect and a satisfying end to an epic saga. It exceeds your highest expectations with too many pleasant surprises. An experience you will remember forever. The final hour of the movies is a perfect masterpiece filled with goosebumps, excitement tears. A new benchmark has been set for the upcoming superhero movies."
2391,Just oh my God. I wasnt ready for this. Every Mcu fan will love that movie
2392,This movie was an excellent film that fulfills expectations and maintains a serious tone but doesn't fail to make you laugh. In the audience there are audible cheers as each character is revealed and tears among all audience members as the sad inevitably happens. The bad reviews often overlook the culture and environment this film gives easy 20/10
2393,"The best end for marvel studio movies, and best story and drama"
2394,"For the disappointed fans, please bear in mind that it took 22 movies over 11years to make this happened. And you thought it was easy to suit everyone's liking? With some saying that the characters were ruined in this movie. It's 5 years later and you expected Thor to keep his shape. That's 5 years of guilt that he had to go through. Hulk didn't get even throw a punch in this movie? Come on, man. He had enough screen time to make his character shine. It's the story that builds up the action not action builds up the story. And that is 22 films into this major plot. Have we ever seen anything like this in movie history??? You should at least be thankful that this is happening in your lifetime. I'm giving a 8/10 for the movie and another +2 for everyone that made this happened over the the last 11years. Would you have better plan to make this movie in a period of 3hours? Then do it yourself!"
2395,"This by far the best marvel movie I have ever watched, the emotions are strong, the battle was amazing, and when I watched it, i was shaking so much, and I couldn't breathe cuz of the fight scenes, and we lost some character's I won't say, but I cried!!, this movie is s must watch am telling you, it well be the best 3 hour and 2 mins of your life!"
2396,"Love u three thousand times
This movie is truly an epic masterpiece that gives the audience one hell of a ride. Thank u Marvel Studio. Thank u, Russo brothers.
Still can't believe this is the end of the original members."
2397,"I laughed I cried, I shouted at one point. I had my head in my hands. I had my hands in the air. I went back to the box office and booked again.One word...... special.See it to believe it, a masterclass in film making. And the perfect close to a decade of entertainment and a year of obsession and theorizing (and STILL being off the Mark.)"
2398,"I don't wanna spoil anything but god damn ..this was amazing, funny, dramatic, sad, action packed...everything about it was just perfect..
The 3 hours went by like they were nothing.
And im gonna go watch it again on Friday because this was a emotion roller coaster and i need more of if."
2399,"Just came from a midnight screening , what a movie ! It will leave with every emotion ! Thank you MCU for this franchise !"
2400,"There really are no words that anyone can use to describe this film. But if I had to put it into one word, it would be ""Spoilers"". See it if you haven't."
2401,"After watching Infinity War, I could not wait for this one. But as the time passed, I felt that End Game would not surpass Infinity War's awesomeness. But now that I have watched it, my advice to everyone is keep your expectations as high as possible, and still it would surpass all your expectations. It truly justifies all the 22 movies and please watch them all before watching this one. Stay away from spoilers. You will laugh and definitely cry multiple times."
2402,"Absolutely perfect conclusion of 10 years of MCU and the excellent ending of Avenger. Don't read reviews, not even spoiler free one. Go see it you won't Regret it! 10 on 10!"
2403,"First like 20 minutes, just wow. Then for like hour and the half it's bringing back old memories, just great. And that last battle for the end, gave everyone chills. I really liked that they showed that Thanos is super strong even without the gaunlet. Great humor as well. Only downside is timeline, I don't know what they did with that.
Btw Hulk, Antman and Thor were amazing. And for the end, thanks for everything Tony and Steve :)"
2404,"Game changer. Spectacular. EPIC.This is EPIC because they have perfected the blend of what to keep and what to throw, recycles yet made it even better, blend of same and differences, they achieve thru the pros and cons in the audience experience... you will see inspiration and reference...it's a HOMAGE to all the Easter Eggs of the Easter Eggs. you would clap at some of the scene, cry at some scene, wanna scream, wanna jump, and you leave with honour and proud... a sense of calmness, and say, they did a fine job. as all GOOD vs EVIL movies should be... but this one is raise the bar for blockbusters.What is better than LEGEND? And making the promise that they will keep their promise.
Spoiler Alert-- --It's like Marvel trying to tell us, they will not make another Iron Man movie unless Robert Downey Jr. is starting.
What is better than LEGEND?LEGACY"
2405,It's the best way possible to end properly the avengers saga.
2406,This movie is beyond the expectation. I think this statement is enough to get an idea without any spoilers that how is the movie.
2407,"An emotional climax full of action, humor and time travel. The first part kind of finishes Infinity War storyline by having Thor kill Thanos when the Avengers, together with Captain Marvel, find him in space. The story then jumps 5 years later as the characters deal with the after effects of Infinity War in their before they figure out a way to undo Thanos snap with the aid of Antman and his time travel time theory. The storyline seems to have lots of dialogues but then viewers are quickly rewarded with great action scenes. And Oh My God, the final battle with Thanos(who time travels from the past to the present) and his army is just awesome as you have all the heroes taking a part in the battle. And we also lose some of our favourite characters."
2408,Absolutely speechless.... I have no words to express the absolute masterpiece that marvel has created. Exceptional!
2409,"Marvel best movie ever ..
mind blowing ,great action must match.."
2410,"We've spent 11 years waiting for this peak 3 hours. Thank you Marvel. It was the most ""everything"" I've ever seen."
2411,"I didn't think this could surpass Infinity War but the Russo Brothers did it.
Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame managed to do it. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and I'll go so far as to say, maybe even the absolute pinnacle of the Marvel franchise. It's both hilarious and emotionally engaging (there were people crying at my theatre including me). And while it's a lot more character focused than Infinity War, as it should be considering this is the final hurrah for many of the original Avengers, that doesn't mean it's lacking In terms of visuals. The film is an absolute spectacle to behold, it easily tops Infinity War's action sequences in my opinion and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated.10/10 best Marvel movie in my opinion. It's honestly hard for me to see how they'll ever be able to top this one."
2412,There are so many surprises and twists in this film. I believe it's really a perfect ending for the first decade of MCU!! Couldn't be better!!
2413,"My wife and I have been huge fans of all the Marvel moives and watch opening weekends! I almost couldn't sleep waiting for this movie with all the build up for it, with how crazy IW was I couldn't think how this would turn out. How much I don't want to agree with alot of the comments the first 2 hours are really slow. Why are we building up charactors again when there have been 20+ movies??? The deaths that happened to Black Widow and Iron Man were suprising. I was very happy that they finally showed how powerful the Scarlet Witch is but that was short lived too. You bring Captian Marvel in and she only has 15 minutes of screen time at best??? I love how tough it was for them to kill Thanos with no gaulet at the end fight but, in the start they kill him right away.This movie is good don't get me wrong but, if you asked me to watch this one or IW there isn't even a debate there. These movies should have been combined or creat a third movie if you need it. It's like all the story and energy went into IW and not this one. There are some awesome moments like when Cap uses the hammer and gets the final family life he wanted but, that took forever, what about agent 13 that just goes to the way side?Not the best MCU movie but, still enjoyable!I would love to rate 10/10 but that would be a lie, might even be a 7/10."
2414,Marvel has over the years delivered movie after movie and we have been watching. Not only did they give us the ending we needed but they did it in a way which connected everything we have seen through the MCU. I just want to some how forget that the MCU exists so that I can watch all the movies all over again. Will definitely be seeing Endgame again in cinema.
2415,"This is where everything we've watched comes together and it is a thrilling movie experience. Although still not as good as the original avengers film. It is truly impressive how everything is blended beautifully with a mind flowing finale. Sure the time traveling stuff feels a little unnecessary but it works for the overall story. Its complexity gives all the performers here some inspired moments. I mean it was one hell of an experience being in the theater opening night and watching the audience go insane. This too me feels like the end of these films and although it goes on just a bit too long it ties everything up nicely.Budget: $356m
Box Office: $2.797B9/10"
2416,"A woman, who has lived and died in the flesh and blood of mortals, has never had a real family, never really been with someone she likes, and finally gave her life for the world. She died so far away, and there was not even a decent funeral after her death. Her friends almost didn't mention her after a short period of grief like no one else In the end, when someone is remembered all over the world, she almost seems to have never existed. Can it be worse?"
2417,"Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends. With all this being said this is a very well made movie worth your time and money."
2418,"When I walked into the theater for my first viewing of Endgame, I was prepared to see a great superhero movie. I expected some massive fight scenes, a few emotional gut punches, and to walk away with a generic positive message about overcoming obstacles. But I could have never guessed that night that I would cry like a baby, go completely numb from pure awe, and leave the theater with a fresh take on what it really means to be human. It was a night I'll likely remember for the rest of my life.It all started back in 2008 with the first Iron Man, which was soon followed by several other movies based on popular superheroes from Marvel comics. These superheroes became known as Avengers, appearing together in several blockbuster hits to fight world-threatening enemies. Endgame is the culmination of 22 movies across 11 years, and the anticipation and pressure from the fans were higher than ever before. But somehow, Marvel managed to produce an overwhelmingly satisfying conclusion that met or exceeded all expectations.The premise of Endgame's storyline is fairly simple: defeat the mad titan Thanos after he wiped out half the universe's population and bring back everyone he killed. However, it ends up quite complex, dealing with quantum physics and time travel. The directors, Joe and Anthony Russo, do an admirable job of making the storyline easy to follow, bouncing between dozens of different settings and timelines without feeling too cluttered. There are also a surprisingly low number of plot holes considering that the movie deals with time travel.When it comes to pacing, the film has some minor issues. It sometimes feels unnecessarily drawn out during some of the middle sections, where the movie takes a less serious tone and the stakes don't feel quite as high. But it more than makes up for it with an action packed beginning and ending filled with shocking surprises and adrenaline rushes to keep the audience on the edge of their seats.One of the movie's most impressive feats is how it is able to include so many characters without making a single one feel left out. The main characters of this movie are the original six Avengers, which include Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. Apart from the Hulk, who unfortunately does not get much of a spotlight, all of their characters develop beautifully throughout the movie and have several major moments to shine. Iron Man in particular ends up almost the complete opposite of his selfish, egotistical, and ignorant past self. Even Thanos, despite being the main antagonist, has a very interesting arc that affects his grand motives as he learns more about humanity's flaws.As we have come to expect from marvel, the production quality is as good as it gets. The acting performances from all the cast members are easily some of the best they have ever done. Whether through dialogue or simply just facial expressions, the actors and actresses do an amazing job conveying their characters' emotions. The visuals are stunning, with a vibrant color palate and awe inspiring cinematography. The movie relies heavily on cgi, but it is done so well that everything looked completely photorealistic. Accompanying that was a stellar soundtrack by Alan Silvestri that masterfully matches the tone of each scene, elevating them to new heights. ""Portals"" in particular is one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, and it still gives me major chills every time I listen to it.The movie particularly excels at creating a very atmospheric feel to many of its scenes, using it's soundtrack and visuals to immerse the viewer into its vast world. Some of the best examples of this are in an early scene with Iron Man in a spaceship, which wonderfully captures the melancholic but peaceful tone of the scene. And perhaps the most prominent example is in the iconic ""Portals"" scene, which emanates sheer awe with its beauty and scope, starting slowly and naturally building up to an earth-shattering climax.A common criticism with superhero movies in general is that they are mindless ""popcorn entertainment"" only good for action and surprises. However, with Endgame, this could not be further from the truth. Through the Avengers' personal struggles and Thanos's quest to make a perfect universe, the film goes the extra mile in showing how the world and its people are far from perfect, but our lives can still be beautiful. This idea is especially shown within the deeply moving final few scenes.Avengers: Endgame is a wonderfully thrilling experience for its audience. But it goes a step further and shows us why cinema and storytelling are so important. As Endgame illustrates, emotions are defining characteristics of humanity, and whether good or bad, they shape our lives and allow us to grow. What better way to experience these emotions than through some amazing stories?"
2419,"I am totally blown away! The whole summer I sat and watched through the whole MCU and was so hyped for Endgame. It didn't disappoint. I love how great the balance between action and emotional character scenes was. And the character development! I don't understand why everyone criticize Hawkeyes development, cuz it was great. I love how he has gone from a totally boring action character in avengers 1 to a character you cared about. He made me cry so many times. That's a point too. I cried so much, and I have a hard time crying when I watch movies. And the time travel aspect that got so much critic. I love how they actually made a great thing about the quantum realm. When I watched Ant-man I thought about this, and finally! And the ending of Captain America... I have literally not cried so much in my whole life. What a great ending to one of the greatest humans of history! It's just one thing though, you have to be a marvel and watch the whole mcu before to understand. But I'm a marvel nerd, so I'm pleased! Go watch it right now, and prepare to become emotional and lose your whole supply off tears!"
2420,"One of the greatest movies I've ever seen. The plots really stunned me. It's a filled with everything that a movie should have. Great respect to Joe and Anthony and the full credit goes to the father of MCU, Stan Lee 😍😍😍"
2421,I was expecting something more than a simple time travel solution from Marvel.
2422,When you bring a character in late and force them and their off screen agenda down our throat it is going to leave a bad taste. Say what you will but this is about the character and its rushed story.The powers that be assumed all of us that like Marvel Pictures would slurp up the captain snowflake drivel. It will never happen. All the other actors had had enough too as was obvious during all the junkets.
2423,Best comic book movie ever.you can watch the movie more than one time.
2424,A great reward for all the previous films and is a true testament to the great MCU
2425,This movie makes fans of got dream about getting Russo brothers to direct got's last season these two have exceeded thier limits and have given marvel movies an ending they deserve and the treatment to the characters has been something got should take lesson . Incredible direction acting and movie
2426,This not an ordinary movie it is work of 11 years and 21 films to get there. Every moment is perfect such a great work I can't imagine the effort that marvel do to produce the perfect cinematic universe I have ever seen. I won't talk about the movie to avoid spoilers but there is at least three or four moment to touch you and making you cry and two or three moment to just stands wherever you are and clap. I can tell it easy that is the best superhero movie I have ever seen (no one talk about dark knight in my opinion it is not a superhero movie)
2427,"Great Movie, I want see Iron Man in next future movies on MCU"
2428,"I was impressed with the film, especially the performance of Tony Stark"
2429,Good film. It could be great if there was not that much idiot jokes and that Thor was threared as non idiot. And everyone who says this is better than Nolan's trilogy is idiot. Anyone who says this is better than Man of steel or BvS or Watchmen is also an idiot.
2430,Ranged from merely ok to messy and contrived. Disappointed they resorted to a time travel movie (was that the best they could come up with??). Hated what they did to Hulk and Thor. Hawkeye was irritating and Captain Marvel was hyped up for basically nothing... Infinity War was far far better.
2431,"Had huge expectations from End Game after the ending of Infinity War and it just fell flat after initial 40 min's.Movie feels boring at lot of places and the ending....lets not talk about it... could have been more sensational. There are few moments having humour...but those moments are very shortlived.
What worst...made martyr of character whose movies were the best of all Marvel Universe."
2432,Just how much time we need to see a movie like this again
2433,"It really what we can call, the best end to the avengers.
The visual effects are wonderful with lots of laughter and emotional scenes.
The 3d 4dx worth it."
2434,I was just expecting more action... I was relatively bored for the first 2/3 of the movie.
2435,For a 3hr film it flies by. Ties up the MCU nicely and the best film I have seen in a while. Highly recommend
2436,"Everyone must watch
It is one of the best movie of this decade
Vfx is ultimate"
2437,"While no rabid Marvel comic book fan, I can say I have enjoyed the Avengers and their journey. From individual films that fleshed out back story to them coming together and being the force needed has been one long memory I will cherish.Endgame was a true example of how to go out on top of your game. From the humor, the rich characters, the chemistry, the past (heartaches and joy), to the final minutes was a perfect mix and wild ride. It was a bittersweet ending. It did not need ""that particular scene"" to swell the emotions. The whole film was masterfully crafted with extra bits of care within the group.There were some flubs, sure.They did not detract from the story nor did they stand out. For me, it added to the ""human"" feels. As I said, this should become the gold standard for going out on top rather than a whimper across the finish line. Did not feel like 3 hours, it went by far too fast.If you don't see any other film this year, get to the theater for this one. It will engulf you and spirit you away from everyday."
2438,"I am not a typical science fiction movie fan but i love movie as long as it has good story, graphics and can make me feel become part of movie.After having watched Endgame i was literally in shock due to emotions i felt. even a sane person like me who know the difference between real life and reel life cried, smiled, laughed and man!! those goosebumps i felt during some science where Avengers get hope of success were incredible.Yes i agree first part of movie was not that fast but it was great since it built a pavement for bigger building, and also make us feel how heartbroken a man feel when he fails to save his loved once after trying everything. It make me realize the importance of loved one in my life.As a movie it is perfect. But i am sad that it ended.story line of movie without spoiling movieHopelessness/abject sadness -> hope -> courage -> sad -> hope -> courage + fun -> honor -> valor -> sad -> hopeAnd at last i love you 3000"
2439,"I watched Endgame in IMAX with Laser and it was nice. This resulted in bright images, especially the oceans, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen with a little of chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing!It may have taken 11 years, 21 films but Endgame finally has shown redemption Connecting and linking this movie with the past films is not easy and smart direction from Joe Russo and Anthony Russo. It is not only about superpowers but about love commitment, compassion and sacrifice. Tony Stark removes his ego and Steve Rogers finally got what he wanted.The only con of this movie was the running time. The three hours could have been scrapped or at least an interval to go to the loo.!My score= 8.5/10"
2440,This was a good movie. Loved it!!!! Loved the ending too!!!!!!
2441,"What went wrong? Too much thrown into one lonnngggg film..(learn from justice league!) Emotions are everywhere so can not process who?what? where for a second? Thors fat, The hulk!? The HULK! does not throw one blow? Spider-Man is in it for 1minute etcccc.. so your stuck with the most boring of the marvel universe..Robinhood, black widow, iron man 2, the rabbit, what's her face cyborg woman & captain A- ..then fat Thor makes an ugly embarrasing scene as does professor hulk?? & a flying justin bebeir, a bit of poor humour to overlook the severe plot holes. One big action scene that was good if not too messy and snap..
Ps..The time travel is worst than back 2 the future part 3..an Anti climax and a Charitable 7/10."
2442,Thank you everyone that played a role in this movie production! The best in our time! #WhateverItTakes
2443,"If you are a marvel fan: you will watch it anyway, STOP LOOKING FOR SPOILERS
And if you aren't a marvel fan: go watch every marvel movie ever right now. Stop reading. GO!!!"
2444,Not enough time for all the characters. Should have been a two parter
2445,"I'm a bit disappointed on the melodramatic first act. It was a really, really poorly written melodramatic first act.It was, with Black Panther and Hulk, the most boring passage of a Marvel MCU movie. Some great parts here and there (mostly Tony, which was basically god like perfect in this movie, including Downey's perfect acting) and Rocket.When the actual movie starts (and stops being basically an epilogue, a bad one, to Infinity War), it gets interesting even if a bit confusing (even with three hours, the plot explanation goes fast).And in the end, the movie lands the epic ending. No words necessary.Also, I would never watch that first hour and a half again. Which is a shame, considering how perfect Infinity War was.-------Oh I forgot (this is an edit). Captain Marvel was in this movie (barely). I absolutely ADORE HER in every aspect. Her attitude. Her character. The actress. The looks.But oh boy, her power level! Don't know if it's good or bad yet"
2446,The fact that some people disliked this movie honestly baffles me. This movie beyond exceeded my expectations. It was a perfect mix of humor within sadness. Throughout the movie I would constantly get goosebumps from the sheer epicness of the moment. Truly a perfect ending to an era. I applaud the directors.
2447,"Many other reviews have mentioned this already but I had to add my 2 cents. Thor and Hulk. Utter trash what the Russo's did to them.Also the film just was not good enough. Especially to end such a dramatic and exceptional story arc like the infinity war. Just not good enough. Was not horrible but I am a bit disappointed.Also all that talk about not doing too much to change the past and how they can just go back, grab the stones, use the gauntlet and then put them back and all is good? Uhh what about killing Thanos from 9 years in the past in present time? So no infinity war.....no attack on new york....really curious if phase 4 addresses any of that."
2448,"I knew things would get messed up as soon as they went time-travel.Now I'm going to spend more time trying to figure out all the time travel goof ups they ignored and being disappointed at the conclusions you end up coming toConclusions:There are now 3 separate times lines:One where Thanos succeeds and everyone is still in shock trying to recover and canon still holds and our heroes are left grieving and torn apart.Another where Thanos dies and doesn't succeed and things go forward from canon.And a third where Thanos dies, never exists, neither do Gamora and Nebula as we know them, Captain America never comes in to the 21st century, Avengers never happen and canon is totally obliterated.But everyone remembers, which is also a time travel goof up.And I'm sure I can come up with a bunch more, if I keep thinking about it.Disappointing to say the least.I never watched any of the Iron Man movies because an Avengers movie was just enough of exposure of his character to suit me. An entire movie series of just him would have me trying to blind and deafen myself. So I never watched them. That lack made me not even tear up at his sacrifice.To all those who wonder how Cap could wield the Hammer? We got the hint he could do it way back in Avengers: Age of Ultron. During the party, they were all doing the ""Are you worthy?"" game and took turns trying to lift the hammer.Thor and the audience saw the hammer move when Cap ""tried"" to lift it. Rumor was back then, he could move it, but chose to not reveal it. Rumor proved true.The ending battle, while epic, was, after a awhile, like watching a very ornate video game. Unlike the massive Infinity War battle, done in bright sunlight where the actors were very evident, this was done in a dark setting and at most, you saw a few seconds of the real actor before being replaced by CGI for most of the rest of the action. Disappointing. I didn't want to see a big video game.The stealing of the stones to resolve the whole issue was also lame. Why didn't they do this in Infinity Wars? Instead of trying to steal the whole gauntlet, why not just take the stones? Or even a few of them?You could see the Russo's trying to satisfy fan questions from the last movie:Why didn't they just cut off Thanos' arm? They did it here.
Why didn't Thor go for the head ? He does here.Also disappointing was Steve offering the shield to Wilson instead of Bucky.Stan Lee's cameo came and went so fast I didn't know it was him.All in all, for me, a anti-climatic end for the series, ending with a whimper instead of a bang. As far as the Marvel series goes, this isn't one of its best and that's sad for the last one."
2449,"Finally it's here. But not the finale we deserve. The story is quite thin, the action is scarce and the 3+ hours is too much. The humor saves the movie. Without humor it would have been a total disaster. This should have been the finale that would be epic. Looks like they where going for the quick money instead of waiting to perfect it. Sad to see it end like this."
2450,"I was so excited for this film but came out a bit meh. The first 2 hours are hard work. Theres no actual beginning. Think they should have started it with the IW end scene. Theres no connection to that. Captain Marvel is just there and no announcement about who is she, where did she come from. And she actually seems a bit pointless tbh. Needed her in the beginning and after that they could have got by without her. And theres no footage of what the world is like since the snap. Everyone is just depressed. Quite a few hundred plot holes in it too. Time travel is a difficult thing to work with and get right.
Felt the timing was off too. They built up the scene to be really emotional and then theres a random joke and the moments killed. Why!? Only started to enjoy it in the last hour where there actually was some major action. But even that still felt like it was just repeating the ending of IW just reversing it.
Although Cap becoming worthy of holding the hammer (which we knew he could do anyway) got a humongous response from the audience. Especially the 12 year old on front of me who almost popped with excitement. Think they ended it right though. Felt like the right time to end certain characters. Dont get me wrong it was a great film but I wont be watching it again until I have the DVD. Unlike IW which I saw at least 4 times in the cinema. Very over hyped I think."
2451,"My first reaction when I saw the endgame ending was I'm done with MCU and that was not not because of any bad moment that was because death of Tony Stark. There are some confusing moments that I am sure will be explained by upcoming MCU movies this was great movie.
Thank you Black Widow, Captain America and Iron Man."
2452,"This movies wasn't as good as I thought it would be. First of the ending was predictable and the deaths were just of the lesser characters or major characters you expected to die. It was just al so predictable and what they did to thor was a crime. They made him from an awesome god to a fat drunk just for the sake of comedy? Further I don't read that much of the marvel comics, but I'm quite sure they were really inconsistent with the comics. Such as Sam as the new captain? In the comics that's Bucky. And Valkyrie as the Queen is also something they just added for a cliché happy ending. My conclusion is that this just wasn't as good as infinity war."
2453,"A lot of people clearly liked the Avengers: Endgame. I heard Chris Evans cried in some places when he watched the finished movie. I could see what he meant but I didn't cry. In fact there was so much going on that I felt I needed a scorecard. Who was on screen, what was their motivation and what happened 2, 3 or 4 movies ago. I have seen all the movies but clearly not as up on it as some I met, who apparently had seen some of the movies several times.Overall not bad but here are a few moans -The infinity stones always seemed a MacGuffin to me. They appeared from nowhere and had strange powers, often not explained much or used much either.I heard but don't really get Thanos's motivation. He seems to have some hand wavy reason for wanting to reduce the universe's population. Paradoxically, even though, he's the villain it plays into the rather PC idea that there are too many people. People are a blessing, not a curse.Captain Marvel was played up a bit. She's the only one who can save the universe? Apparently she's been busy elsewhere until now.Now in conclusion, not bad but not good. OK movie but could have been shorter for my liking.For comparison, I had a brief look at what I'd watched in a cinema from the last 12 months and the ones that stood out include First Man, Shazam, Glass, Jurassic Wrold: Fallen Kingdom, Deadpool 2, The Happy Prince, Christopher Robin, Green Book, White Crow, Dumbo, Wild Rose. I find most of them better than Endgame."
2454,"What a brilliant finale to a wonderful saga, the infinity war saga will surely go down as one of the great cinematic achievements of all time. Avengers Endgame brings together all the characters we have grown to love and finishes the saga in a spectacular way. WHATEVER IT TAKES"
2455,"Avengers: Endgame is so epic and grandiose that it's impossible not to at least crack a smile during it's conclusion. Surprisingly though, the movie is at it's best when quietly self-reflecting on the journey of some of it's main characters. I'm impressed with how well the Russo's manage to make the story feel personal amidst a collection of characters and universe ending stakes.Seeing this on opening night with a cinema full of people laughing (and some crying) was a rare experience. When the credits finally hit, a friend turned to me and said 'it's the end of an era.' Nothing quite like what Kevin Feige and the Russo's have pulled of here has been done before, and I'm unsure if it will ever be done so well again."
2456,"I had high hopes for this, and after watching I'm very glad that the movie didn't let me down.
It was fun, and unlike some of the blockbusters the emotions were also presented in this one. I can see there was a bond slowly building between the avengers over the course of last three movies and in this one, it became more intense and now they were more like a big family than just coworkers. And I found that endearing.
The ideas about time travel were kind of interesting, not similar to those time-travelling movies(all of which were basically mentioned in this one) we had seen before. Though I don't think it was scientifically logical but well, it can be explained(not a hundred percent though)in the movie's context(about time being a loop and going forward is equal to going backward).
Natasha's death was definitely the worst part for me, emotionally. But nevertheless it was predictable. However I found Tony's death gratuitous, they could fix him, or at least, try to fix him. I mean, time-travel was already on the table so why can't they save someone who's vital's ""critical"" aka not-dead?
Also, it felt somewhat inconsistent where cap went back to stay with Carter, given his relationship with Sharon in the Civil War."
2457,"Thanks for with me in my best 11 years.
I love you 3000 times.
Simply the one best thing to live in Earth as Human."
2458,Endgame is the ultimatest MCU Movie i've ever seen. Love it. Awesome.
2459,You didn't saw that coming. If you don't leave the theater crying there is something really wrong with you
2460,"What a masterpiece. I'm still in tears, even after 7 hours.. It was better than anything I've imagined."
2461,"I wanted this movie to be the the ending that was deserved. The film is ok but it's not even close to infinity war.
This film feels rushed. The way Tony works out time travel just felt overly convenient. The middle portion of the film was ok and the where a few nice moment, but as we progress through this we are left with more and more questions.
A fat Thor and professor hulk was awkward and unecessary and they where only there to force some luaghs.
The final battle, the bit we where building up to, the final stand off between good and evil. This was the most disappointing part of all. Avengers Vs Thanos and his army. And then completely out of the blue every one else was there as well. This felt like they only used the battle to show horn everybody else's in. It was very messy and confusing at time the camera moved so fast we couldn't tell who was who.
I wanted this film to close the door on this phase of the franchise, but all it does is open more doors and behind these more questions.
While this is an ok film in feel we have been short changed."
2462,"So much wasted potential, even though the actors performances were flawless and the overall movie wasn't bad It just didn't live up to the expectations, the whole time travel senario was ruined by one simple phrase ""if we change the past that doesn't affect our future"" felt like they chose the easy way out, you cant have such a cool superhero like Thor being portrayed by an excellent actor and humiliate him like that you just cant."
2463,It was amazing. The hole movie was so good a would watch it again and again. WHAT a experience
2464,"People Who Are saying It very Bad,Go Back 10 yrs Back and Watch The Whole Marvel Series Again,
Then only You will Understand This Movie,I liked it
Because I understood Everything ,I felt the 3hr like 1hr"
2465,"Ok so, starting off I will admit I have never been huge into the MCU. But goddamn this movie was amazing. Hands down the best fight scene I've ever seen in a non animated film to date. And so far the only action movie to bring me to tears."
2466,"Loved this. Full on entertainment. If you guys are a superhero freak like me, this one would surely not disappoint you."
2467,"Can't believe all the bad reviews. This was a great film that will last for decades. It's funny that some reviewers say this would never happen in real life, of course not dummies open your imagination."
2468,"Avengers: Endgame is without a doubt the best Marvel film ever, and my favorite film I've ever seen!!! Amazing from start to finish. Had a very emotional beginning and picks off from there. The actors were all amazing. I loved how unexpecting it was! It was a very beautiful, emotional, and satisfying conclusion to the Infinity Saga. It ended the character's story in a marvelous way, and I wouldn't have changed anything about it. This movie does not disappoint!!! Thank you Marvel for making this masterpiece a reality!!!"
2469,"The most anthemic and fullfilling experience of my entire life. This is the movie that made me shout, clap and scream out of pure joy, a true superhero masterpiece that I cannot describe how happy this movie made me. It's not that it's flawless, it's that I can forgive every mistake because it was one of the best experiences of my entire life, I left the movie theater as a completely satisfied person. The story continues where Infinity War left it and I said ""This couldn't get any better"" and I was wrong, Avengers: Endgame was like a dream coming true concluding a story that I waited for a whole year to learn where it goes and I was totally amazed by the result. Many people have issues especially with the middle section of the movie, but I couldn't find any problems (as of my taste), I think this movie completes everything, gives me anything I wanted and hoped for, makes me emotional yet entertained and manages to keep me chanting for the legendary scenes that will be written in cinema history. As perfect as the Avengers franchise can get. AMAZING!"
2470,Avengers endgame is like a 3 hours roller coaster ride which will make you laugh and make you cry. At some moments you will be speechless and at some moments you will not be able to stop yourself shouting. And at the end you will be happy to be the part of this 3 hours journey.
2471,"Although I'm a Marvel fanatic, I was very disappointed by the end game. Ok I understand that Marvel wanted to close a circle and start a new one but they could have done it much better. This film had numerous cliches like: Thor seeing again his mother, Stark catching up with his father and Captain with his love. In my opinion , the ideas with the fat and useless Thor, Hulk-proffessor mix and Captain America hammering and controlling lightening were disastrous. I would prefer to have seen all of them maintaining their character and their own powers. Mixing all together as a salad wasn't so fascinating. But the worse they have done is that they have killed Stark (Although he had a wife and daughter). Ok, we understand that RDJ was too expensive and unwilling to do another film , but if they wanted to end it somehow, they achieved the opposite result by sacrificing him this way: EVERYONE now demands the return of RDJ- STARK-IRON MAN to finish his career peacefully as he deserved it (And then finding the next iron man substitute). Last but not least, the battle scenes of Infinity war were much better than the battle of End Game and heroes like captain marvel, black panther , doctor strange, guardians -even spider man, are too weak to replace the glorious IRON MAN, CAPTAIN AMERICA and HULK!!!!!!! DEAR MARVEL PLEASE RETHINK YOUR STRATEGY!!!
5/10 For the special effects and because we love these heroes!!"
2472,It was the best Avengers move hever!! I remained speechless!!
2473,"Infinity war was a tough act to follow; ultimately nothing was likely to be sufficient as a closing act.
Disregarding plot holes, which don't really matter to much in an action film, there are a few aspects which brought the film low.The movie is very self-indulgent with fan service. A little is fine, but it's a massive component in this movie.There's Ragnarok-level humour, which will undoubtedly be to the tastes of many - just not mine.The film is very slow to get off the ground. That's fine as long as there is some real substance, but it's lacking.Characters have been handicapped in order to curb the power creep, where as others are momentarily escalated in ability. This is not uncommon, but very noticeable in this flick due to the volume.Of course, you're going to see it regardless; don't go in sky-high expectations and you'll probably have a good time."
2474,"And they made the one that really, really worked.
There were old people, 70+ years old, and young,6, 7, or 8 years old.
Total fans and people who had only seen a few of the preceding 22 movies
They all applauded.
There were times the theatre was so quiet you could hear a pin drop.
There were times when everyone held their breath.
There were times you could not be so stone coldhearted that you would not tear up.
There were times when you could not help but smile.
There were times when you had to laugh.
There were times when you recalled a special moment from an earlier movie in a brand new way.
There were things that are brand-new
By the end of the movie you saw the whole series in a different light.
I wish I could see it again without ever having seen it beforehand.
There were so many small touches that made the movie special and capped the series perfectly. And yet, the movie worked for people who had never read the comics or seen most of the movies.
Like I said, they made the one that really, really worked.
Thank you, Avengers!

2475,"Pretty much all the 10/10 ratings have said it's a great ending to the epic story that has been going since 2008 or so and I agree.Ending a story doesn't mean a movie should be able to ignore storytelling techniques, explanations and other things just to make you sad at the end.There is another review that said the movie was good but when you think about it it gets worse, and I felt this way too.Here are issues I had:Scott Lang getting out of quantum realm felt like a cop out (Time jump between Scott driving from San Fran to New York was unexplained (not a major issue but just made later problems more obvious)Time travel idea was semi-ok but then Captain America appeared at the end in same timeline: thought they couldn't be in same timeline, and wasn't explained that he travelled again later (if that's what he did)Thanos was completely O.P. despite not having infinity gauntletCaptain Marvel would have won in about 2 seconds but flew off somewhere and only appeared again at the endScarlet Witch would have won in about 2 seconds as well but apparently Thanos is more powerful without the gauntlet (artillery from ship was a realistic way to save him though so fair enough)Captain America's use of mjolnir seemed like a convenient cop out as well - deus ex machina - could have made it disappear in Thor: Ragnarok, saved by Odin and he says ""will be there again when it's needed"" and then pre fight it appears and flies to CA's hand and then boom no problems off they goStark removing all the stones from the gauntlet near the end was like wtf just happenedIf the GotG, Iron Man, Dr. Strange, and Spider-Man almost stopped it all despite Thanos having the gauntlet then why can't Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, etc. stop him without itBlack Widow and Hawkeye at Vormir was an obvious outcome, Hawkeye has a family and Black Widow doesn'tOverall I enjoyed the time travel scenes on Earth the most, enjoyed the interaction between Tony and his dad but the rest felt either too slow or too quick.The movie had a unique issue in that there were so many characters, you never saw any of them. Think the longest interactions were between Tony and Nebula, Natasha and CA, and then maybe Tony and Howard Stark. A shame that actors like Tom Hiddleston, Cumberbatch, Samuel L. Jackson etc. didn't get as much time because they are great actors.In the end, wasn't even that sad Tony died because he had just been lost in among all the characters and I've been keeping up, saw Iron Man 1 in cinemas when it came out."
2476,"9.4/10 on imbd - probably voted by avengers fans.This is a very average movie, weak storyline, no depth."
2477,"I mean, its a good movie, but its full of ""Captain America"" morale, a la Civil War. Somewhat good closure, but Captain Marvel is too much of a godmode character. Decent, but not that great."
2478,It started off alright but then it messed with time travel and it just got worse. It devolved into chaos and everyone was screwed over.
2479,"As a longtime fan of the MCU and even more so the comics, I felt kind of empty inside after watching this movie. There were a lot of changes from the comics that I can get behind, but more that I can't.First thing I can't understand is how they didn't implement Adam Warlock into the story; even though they teased him in a end credit several movies ago.Second thing I don't understand is why they need captain Marvel to stick out so much as the strongest hero, even though she doesn't hold a candle to lets say Thor in power levels that you can find in comics or wikis. I get that Hollywood want to look progressive and cool with centering more on badass female characters. The scene in Avengers infinity war were Scarlet witch gets assistance from two women was cool, but now there's a scene were like 20 women assemble during this huge last arc fight and I just think they're forcing it to hard.Third thing are the millions of small plot holes I found in the movie, which I'm not gonna go over, because my review would be ""infinity characters"".The visuals of the movie were great. The one thing I did find a bit off putting were the Hulks facial features. Otherwise didn't notice anything.
9/10 VISUALS.The acting was great for the most part. RDJ and Benedict Cumberbatch among others never dissapoint. Some actors are not of the same caliber but overall very good acting.
8/10 ACTING.The thing that bugged me if you read the beginning of my review and have made it this far was the writing of the plot. Not considering the plot holes or the comicbook backstory screw ups, time travel is so lazy. A rat stepped on a control panel to save the galaxy basically. There were some funny/good stuff in the story aswell, but the good just cancelled out the bad for me.
5/10 STORY/PLOT.So my final Score is approximatly 7,3/10 (22/30) aestheticly pleasing, with good acting and ok story.My friend who isn't a big comic fan used my rating system and got 7,7/10 (or 23/30) so appears to be slightly more enjoyable if you aren't a huge fan.My rating system is as follows...
1/10 appaling
2/10 horrible
3/10 very bad
4/10 bad
5/10 ok
6/10 fine
7/10 Good
8/10 very Good
9/10 great
10/10 masterpiece

2480,"Disney knew it was going to make a ton of money from this sequel and so it feels like everyone involved in its production, from directors, writers and actors etc. just didn't bother turning up - aside from collecting their pay cheque. Anyone with a reasonable amount of intelligence and maturity will know the movie undelivered massively. Perhaps trying to weave characters in and out of previous movies took their eye off the quality of the offering. For those who have rated it a 10, once their excitement from all the anticipation dwindles, reality will sobering. Shame all the previous quality, especially infinity, has this movie associated. I should've known something was amiss when cpt marvel turned out to ba a total waste of time. MCU Phase 4...? You can shove that up your....!"
2481,"Never have i cried front of poeple in cinemaxxNatasha and Tony! Rest in peace. Cap died but Roger still here, not long

2482,"The avengers go out with a bang in this movie. It's fun, it's emotional, it's action packed, it has surprises, it does the ending of the avengers movies justice. It starts out slower but it's all worth it for the end. It had moments where people cried, clapped and gasped. Go see it!"
2483,Man oh man what a movie ! cant believe im alive to witness this i cant say much cause that would spoil the movie if i did all im gonna say is that everyone is in a for a roller coaster of emotions and just plain epicness! You will be mindblown it's indescribable how good this movie is !!!!!
2484,"Avengers: Endgame is a well-made and well-deserved victory lap for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It ties in many different storylines from previous films and allows you to reminisce while also saying goodbye to characters you've known and loved. This film has some flaws, of course, but it also made some bold choices and surprised me a number of times. I laughed. I cried. I loved this finale to the Infinity Saga."
2485,"After watching Avengers Endgame , I am ready to say, with all my heart, that this movie is the most unique, fun, touching and satisfying movie ever... Oh and it's not only the best superhero movie ever, it's the best movie in history 🙌
---
ASSEMBLE!"
2486,"I am sorry if i have a bad grammar, i just want to make review for this amazing movie.
i think this movie is complete, the comedy, drama, romance, action, that's all in one movie. i laugh much than i ever do on other movie, i cried 2 times more than i ever do on other movie. I give my 10 stars for you all, the hero who made my life not flat anymore.and for the record, i think the story is unpredictable."
2487,"I've just returned from watching Avengers: Endgame on opening night.
As a fan of Marvel for over three decades I had many expectations and thoughts about what this movie might bring, and this movie was nothing that I expected.
It brought us both the best (and worst in my opinion) versions of Earth's mightiest heroes. And I'm sure that many out there will disagree with me on which is which.
What is undeniable is that the Russo's have managed to achieve what many (including myself) thought impossible, to deliver a film which pays tribute to the past decade's 21 (not including Endgame itself) Marvel Cinematic Universe offerings, whilst simultaneously closing out the story lines and creating an epic masterpiece in itself.
It has humour (some of good), action, emotion and genuinely something for everyone all rolled up into an epic three hours of entertainment, which goes by in a flash. Well done, fantastic work.Thanos, it's Hammertime!"
2488,"Amazing movie best one in mcu there is. I got disappointed with the last 5-10 mins with cap turning old and what they did to Thor which didn't get my perfect score. They were the only disappointing things everything else was everything you'd want. My heart is in pieces to see what has happened to the original six and no one could ever replace them. This movie is worth your money but I warn you. Bring tissues. You'll want them. To see 2 killed, 1 about to die, a burnt hand, a father who has a family so is a retired avenger, and now my favourite super hero is fat. This must be the end to the MCU and I hope that there isn't another avengers movie that replaces the OG avengers"
2489,What a great movie!! You know nothing until the end! Such a masterpiece!!
2490,"The most epic MCU story ever made! Thanks to russo's brother for directed well. And thanks to K Feige, to chose russo's brother."
2491,"I am just speechless at this point. There aren't words available in the dictionary to provide justice to the magnum opus that Avengees Endgame is. Kevin Feige and the Russo brothers have just outdone themselves. You could say that infinity war had some flaws in its narrative context. BUT ENDGAME IS THE PERFECT SUPERHERO MOVIE. One of my most favourite films of all time PERIOD. It manages to live up to the expectations of hardcore fans to the maximum and so much more.
General movie going audiences will also enjoy this as it is in many ways its own movie and doesn't depend too much on previous installments.
Do yourselves a favour guys and watch it ASAP. TRULY A MASTERPIECE"
2492,This movie is perfect. its heartbreaking heartwarming and made with love
2493,"Overall its a good movie and may be an okay finale, it seems like the Seinfeld finale, after a great run a disappointing end, the movie story didnt have fluidity and seems the writers just wanted to finish all endings quickly rather than the smooth flow like in infinity war"
2494,Yeah it's even much better than all Marvel and dc movies and much better than Dark knight. Finally Marvel did it👌 More than a Movie
2495,"Every moment in this movie just makes you surprised, laughed, cried and in the end, it still brings to a close of an Era of MCU FILMS. Truly a Marvel movie indeed. P.S The best yet and will probably gonna watch the second time"
2496,"I'll just say if you understand how time works then you can understand that this movie did not abide by its rules. Just cause antman says back to the future is a lie doesn't mean that all time rules go out the window. Gamora shouldn't be alive and they ruined cap by bringing him back as an old man sitting on a bench which would've worked if they bought him back as an old man thru the quantum realm while he was in the suit. Don't know for the life of me why he was old and on a bench. Wouldn't make any sense relative to time. I don't know maybe I'm nitpicking but they acted like black widow didn't make an ultimate sacrifice by dedicating the whole ending to Tony's death too. Was a decent movie but anyone who says it was great would be lying to themselves but hey that's just my opinion, enjoy it for what it is because it has major flaws with time."
2497,"Such high hopes for this movie after infinity war but was such a let down. Only real action was the last hour of the movie and even then it wasn't anywhere as decent as the action in infinity war. I understand the need to bring the story to a close but it could have been done with better editing out unnecessary storyline within the 1st hour, so dragged! If it wasn't for the ending action scenes I would have given it a 5! Last 15 minutes is also slow and 15 minutes of credits (no post credit scene). So it's 2 hours 40 of the movie and approx 20 minutes credits. Compare a massive franchise like this with lots of the rings trilogy and this is not the mega finale as hoped as return of the king is a proper send off!"
2498,"You can see how the story goes in first 10 mins
Takes forever to finish"
2499,"It's time for the MCU to get the recognition it deserves. Endgame is a masterpiece, well written, acted and directed. No need for the Oscars in 2020, just give all the awards to the Avengers cast and crew."
2500,Avengers Endgame is the best by far. All Marvels Cinematic Universe movies come together beautifully.
2501,"Saw it in 3d otherwise it would have been terrible.
Too many superheros for my liking."
2502,This was a very well written movie. I had my own theory on what I thought was going to happen but was proven wrong. It's definitely an emotional rollercoaster. Enjoy!

2504,Very long and boring ..... frankly disappointed me ... I left with the thought of seeing action as in the first part ... but almost he was sleeping ...
2505,"There are just far too many inconsistencies and questions with this film to mention here. Suffice it to say that there is something seriously wrong when a minor character such as Nebula gets something like 60 minutes of screen time and characters such as Scarlet Witch, Dr Strange, Spiderman, Black Panther, Winter Soldier and others appear for maybe 5 minutes..."
2506,"It's absolutely the greatest superhero movie I've ever seen. The first part of the movie is totally dedicated to Marvel fans, and it's really funny. And the rest is very touching, some superheroes' farewell...
""I love you three thousand times."""
2507,"Once is not enough to watch this movie.
It blew me away."
2508,"While the visual effects were incredible and the memes coming out of this movie were entertaining, I don't think marvel really put too much work into this ending. I went into this movie interested in watching mcu movies and came out completely against them. Probably will never see an mcu movie again."
2509,"Most of the people giving this movie 10/10 dont actually understand what's going on and are just being sentimental. I was like that too when i first walked out of the theatre. I gave it an instant 10/10 in my head. If you were like me, then read my review. It'll hopefully change your mind.
I'll break it down into pros and cons.
Pros:
Build up towards this movie was awesome
SFX and Soundtrack are top notch
Acting is top tier
Action is top tier
The ending to the actual movie was pretty great
Tony stark and captain america get a great send off
There was some decent character development to side characters like black widow and Hawkeye
Cons:
Plot holes (the time travel theory they explained couldve made sense if captain america wasnt on the bench at the end, if captain returned the soul stone then shouldn't he have gotten natasha back? Etc)
Tony's death couldve been avoided I'd nebula had slapped her wrist watch and come back to the present time
Hulk was borderline useless, he tries to crack time travel and Tony does it in 1 night. Hulk also gets minimal action. All comic readers were hyped for world breaker hulk but they literally got dabbled on.
Remind me why Tony didnt use one of the most powerful weapon in the universe to give himself an insane buff before using the stones. He couldve saved himself then.
Why was thanos more powerful without his infinity gauntlet
Everyone got needed so that captain marvel could get an epic feminist entrance only to get bummed by thanos because the fight couldnt end that easily
F for Bucky. He was Captains friend for nearly 100 years but he didnt get the shield
They didnt utilise the pure overpowered possibilities of time travel such as killing baby thanos or maybe going back in time, aiming for the head, saving one timeline from thanos and then using the infinity gauntlet from that timeline back in their own and using THAT one to get bring back their people and possibly stop thanos depending on whether or not nebula is still an idiot.
Basically, biggest con is that the movie couldve been half the length if the heroes properly used their brains and utilised how bs their rules of time travel were"
2510,I'll be in the minority in that I didn't enjoy it. I'm not a huge marvel fan but having to watch 20 odd movies beforehand and keep track of the on-going storyline is a bit much
2511,"A nice conclusion to the saga, it'll give you nerd chills"
2512,"Avengers End Game is about sacrifices. The first Avengers movie was about the challenges of having power. Age of Ultron was about unintended consequences. Infinity War brought those two themes together when almost the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe was faced with the challenge of the mad god Thanos. Endgame starts in the aftermath of that event.The initial mood is one of sorrow and remorse. Stark for example, talks about ""losing the kid"" aka Tony Parker-Spider Man (Tom Holland). There are support groups for people to talk about their losses, which features a cameo by Joe Russo, one of the co-directors. Clint Burton (Jeremy Renner) was even turned into a killer as a result. Everyone was completely devastated by Thanos.Sacrifice is then introduced when Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) returns from the Qauntum Realm and tells the Avengers that time operates differently there. If they could manipulate the realm, they might be able to go back in time and reverse Thanos' act. Different characters then have to give up something to carry out this task. Tony Stark for instance, has to leave not only his wife Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), but his young daughter as well. One of the team has to sacrifice themselves to attain one of the Infinity Stones. Others pay in different ways.Going to the past also allowed Marvel to pay homage to its previous movies since this marked the end of that whole first generation. The first place visited is New York City when the Avengers were formed and fought off Loki (Tom Hiddleston) and the Chitauri. There, Banner runs into the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), and Stark and Captain America (Chris Evans) come across a bunch of Hydra agents working inside SHIELD that were seen during Captain America Winter Soldier including Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). Then Thor (Chris Hemsworth) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) go to Asgard during Thor: The Dark World where the Thunder God gets to reconnect with his mother Frigga (Rene Russo) James Rhodes (Don Cheadle) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) visit Morag from the first Guardians of the Galaxy, while Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Barton go to Vormir seen in Infinity War. There's even one extra flashback where Stark gets to meet his father (John Slattery) and Cap sees Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), which is some foreshadowing.The film is still able to throw some laughs in despite the general feeling of loss. Scott Lang for example, says they should be able to travel through time as long as they don't break the rules, which come from Back to the Future. Then when they experiment Scott gets transformed into a pre-teen, an old man, and then a baby. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) declares that a win. What really steals the show however is the depressed Thor. That is one of the funniest things I've seen. There's a great line where Stark says Thor reminds him of Jeff Bridges from the Big Lebowski. It turns out Thor has some problems with players on Fornite as well that's worth some laughs.Of course, there's a big giant battle at the end that has some fantastic parts such as a whole army coming to the rescue to back up the Avengers against Thano's forces. All the female heroes forming up to push through the bad guys, and a great exchange between Cap and Thor.Really, every Marvel movie up to this point was leading up to Endgame and it delivered."
2513,"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation."
2514,"Alright, the movie is quite as expected, very enjoyable, yet the continuous messing with time ruined it a bit
The plot was quite confusing and the unprecedent deaths made it even more,
The ending gave it a huge plus in my personal opinion perhaps for my over attachment to peggy's story, despite that the ending itself was the most illogical messy thing, it was supposed to be a different timeline not the same so even if cap left to it he's not supposed to appear in the original timeline, but hey it's just a movie after all not really a quantum physics lesson and the ending was the most beautiful thing not just in this movies but the whole series,
One should rate movies as movies not anything else and as a movie Endgame succeeded worth-ly in a way and sadly in another one must say not because of lives loss but also because of the ending of a great film series that we shall certainly miss."
2515,I seen this in the theaters and let me tell you this was the most mixed emotion movie ever this movie had me crying especially at the end and there were some parts that were heart raceing and another part were it was funny so all around i supper recommend to watch this movie it will have you in love it has alot of action
2516,"Avengers: Endgame is not a perfect movie but it is a perfect drama for the fans. ( Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansonn, Chris Hemsworth and Robert Downey Jr. live the movie. They perform perfectly. ) This movie targets the fans, so if you are not a fan I don't advise it. There are a lot of details for the fans. You will feel the fan services in your veins. With an epic final battle, Avengers: Endgame satisfies the fans. It makes sad, it makes happy, it causes excite. It closes a saga and opens a new one for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I love MCU 3000, I love this movie 3000."
2517,I saw it in theaters with my kid. We were both laughing and crying on the edge of our seat.
2518,"This was my best movie ever, all the heros been together, and was sad to saw iron man's death"
2519,Best movie i have ever seen. This movie will be remebered for centuries.
2520,I really enjoyed this movie. Not only did this movie have great actors.. very good story line and I love the way they throw in some comedy too. Enjoyable and entertaining.
2521,"So, Endgame. It's a bit of a letdown for me, for a number of reasons. But let me start with some of the stuff that I liked.First of all, the final battle is very well done and feels like a final gambit from both the Avengers and Thanos to destroy each other for good. The way both sides gradually lose strength over time is awesome.Second, a lot of the acting and special effects are pretty good. So, yeah, that's about it for the good stuff. Now on to the problems, and there are a lot of them.First off, let's talk about the pacing. Infinity War worked so much better. We get some semi-slow scenes, but the film is very fast paced the whole time, and this worked for the type of film Infinity War was.Now we get to Endgame, the opening is pretty fast, then we get about an hour and a bit of mucking around with the time travel, then the Avengers collect the stones across time, which is kinda fast paced. Finally, the heroes reverse the Snap, 2014 Thanos shows up to reboot the universe and kill the Avengers, which is all a really fast ending scene and battle and then semi-slow ending wraps things up. I understand that there were some stakes after the Snap that needed to be reflected on in Endgame, but the pacing should have been more fast-paced in my opinion.Now we get to the problem of Thanos in this film. He feels completely weaker as a character in this film compared to Infinity War. Let's look back at that for a sec. In Infinity War, we see instantly that Thanos is a powerful, intimidating threat and over time we see the logical and personal reasons for him to carry out the Snap. He felt like a character and a villain you could understand and even kinda root for. He's a great villain.Then we get to Endgame. The Avengers kill him easily in the beginning, which isn't my problem; it makes sense for the plot. Thanos is wounded from destroying the stones and is content to die. But then we get introduced to 2014 Thanos, who ends up being the film's antagonist. He gets zero development and feels very one-dimensional the entire film, a far cry from Infinity War. I know a rebuttal to this might be that he was already developed in Infinity War, but this doesn't make sense to me. He's still the antagonist of the film, he should get at least mild development, otherwise he just feels like a chess piece for the plot in order to have a final battle; which is exactly what happened here. At least he still feels like a threat, and almost wins the battle three times throughout its course. The Infinity Blade is a clever way to replace the Gauntlet he had in Infinity War too, so I'll give them that. However, think that this film could have included a couple of flashbacks to give Thanos' 2014 character more development and weight so that he feels much more integrated into the plot rather than a plot device for a finale.Another problem is that the tone of the film feels completely off compared to Infinity War. The film feels like it's trying to juggle a light Guardians or Ant-Man film and a world-ending finale like Infinity War both simultaneously and it doesn't work. The opening of Infinity War executes things perfectly: Thanos theme swelling ominously over the Marvel Studios' opening. The opening of Endgame feels really off: An 70s or 80s sounding light-hearted song playing over the Marvel opening. I think this was a poor direction choice. In summary, the tone felt off and not what a film like this should have been like.I know most of the plot holes of this film have been debunked by now, but I do have one major one: Why didn't 2014 Thanos, instead of travelling willy-nilly to 2023 where he knew he would be at a major disadvantage as the Avengers had the stones, go to 2018 where his future self who had a full gauntlet, find him, tell him the future, and then they both travel to 2023 to reboot the universe? I know that sound complicated, but it makes sense to me. That's the main plot hole for me.Another problem, in my opinion, is that I think it was a terrible idea for the main plot of this film to be about reviving everyone who died from the Snap. I think a much better and well written plot would be about avenging, not reviving, everyone who died. The reason for this is that reviving everyone removes the stakes and consequences of Infinity War immensely, which to me is poor writing. The plot should have been about the Avengers struggling to come together after their failure of Infinity War, then coming together to avenge the fallen by killing Thanos for good. ""If we can't protect the Earth, then we could damn sure avenge it."" It would bring things from the first Avengers full circle. And in this version of Endgame, Thanos would get more development in his past and put up much more of a fight(I know this is contradicting my earlier point of Thanos' contentedness, but I think he would be written with a bit more motivation to defend himself in this film), and possibly have the stones. In my opinion, this would be a much better direction for a sequel to Infinity War.Another problem is that I really dislike the new time-travel component they added to the MCU in this film. It would have been fine if it was a single-film event, where Ant-Man was killed in the final battle and the last Quantum Realm machine was destroyed in the final battle. But they leave the possibility open for more time-shenanigans in future MCU films, which removes the stakes for any future MCU films. Think about the cliffhanger at the end of Far From Home. That can be undone somehow with the time-travel device. In summary, this device removes the stakes for any future MCU films because it exists beyond the film it was introduced in.I think that about sums it up for my issues with Endgame. Now for some more of the stuff I liked. The effects were pretty good, some of the shots in the film look very impressive and well framed, the acting was pretty good for the most part, and the action scenes were really well done. The music was also pretty decent in some parts, and the way the film wrapped up was very satisfying too.Overall, Endgame was quite disappointing for me, but still pretty decent and very well made film."
2522,"Hurts to be a fan and say something like this. Avengers: Endgame is a movie that takes too long to mesh, forcing a situation of drama that does not convince in many parts. Practically 2/3 hours of film with many unnecessary dialogues and misdirected performances. The plot holes and bad decisions of the writers is quite evident, except for those who do not expect much from a movie that should end a fantastic universe era built over eleven years. Even so, it has it's high points in 1/3 - great moments, solid acting, and so much fan service. It's a pity that's not in the same level of Avengers: Infinity War at all, but is an 'Ok movie' and don't deserves 10/10 and 1/1 rates."
2523,"After watching a few times, I keep finding major continuity errors with the film; most of which are already on the imdb page. Thor can now summon the bifrost due to Stormbreaker yet he never once uses it? I guess Tony Stark makes a better Infinity Gauntlet than the giant dwarf in the heart of a dying star can since his gauntlet can snap without taking any damage. Thanos doesn't seem too impressed at the fact the avengers have now mastered time travel and literally a minute later he has a way to do it himself. My favorite part though has to be the end where after 10 years of building everything up and finally getting everyone on the same page, literally every female on the battlefield stops what they are doing to segregate themselves from any male counterparts. That's one way to ruin it."
2524,"I admit, I am not the greatest MCU fan in the world. I love award winning films such an ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""The Godfather"" however the high reviews suggested that this film could be a Brilliant film, not just the average MCU movie which would be okay but not great.
After watching the first few minutes of this feature I thought to myself how this is actually a great film. After watching the first hour I thought to myself how this actually isn't great but still good for marvel standard. After watching the first two hours I thought to myself how this film is inconsistent and mediocre. Finally, after watching the end of the film, I thought to myself how this film is on the lower end of generic and that instead of cleverly addressing how everybody is equal, this film just yells in your women and black people are better than men and white people, which could be easily ignored if not made so in your face.
I'm sorry you hyper-marvel fans but I have to say that the best DC films are better than the best Marvel films (even though the worst DC films are worse then the worst Marvel films) and unless somebody has come up with an idea to make an marvel Dark knight, DC will be in the lead with the three (probably five best as soon as I see the first two superman films) best superhero films of all time."
2525,"Well must say,i didnt watch the movie when it hit the theaters and althought i am a big fan of the franchise. I didnt expect a lot, thought i must be a slower pace to tell the story of the world that was created, yet.... it was damn to slow and borin. Without the death of Nat and Iron Man it would be like a Hallmark production. And even the final battle scene was like a copy paste from the last Averngers. Than Captain Marvel was like 5 sec to see, the funny part was only Thor and Hulk?! What the hell was that? I never liked Mark Ruffalo as Hulk but i let it pass, but here in the last Avengers... am actually glad i didnt get to see it in the cinema, would habe been waste of my money"
2526,"This movie was a very strange experience for me. It wasn't bad but also was not good either. There are constant attempts at humor that feel forced and unnatural (most of Rocket's dialogue feels that way). The whole movie felt like it was saying good-bye instead of building the story. The action scenes were pretty bad. Sure, lots of special effects and great CGI but again, there was nothing supporting any of that. It's the worst Avengers movie and while it might have generated some box office revenue, the story and dialogue are completely forgettable."
2527,"The first half of the movie is incredibly boring, second half is awesome. No emotional attachment to the final scene, it dragged on way too long.Infinity war was way better in my opinion, better balance between action and slow scenes."
2528,"Literally amazing in every way.
You've read all the reviews.
And you're living under a rock if you haven't seen it yet.JUST GO SEE IT!"
2529,"As a die hard fan who has watched all the MCU movies on hall from Thor dark world to Endgame it was a really wonderful experience to witness the 2nd last chapter of phase 3 and the infinity saga I loved endgame from the moment the movie started and till the post credits scene
There were many moments where Endgame made you cried made you feel to scratch your head and made you feel just keep hooting for your heroes but like every movie as a die hard fan I watched it almost 8 times on hall and 3 more times on pc and I can say that there were many flaws in the movie and there were many scenes which could have been better so much for eg (the captain America fight) they could have brought another reference of comics to this movie of old thanos meeting the future one but nothing is ever perfect but I can say this was close to perfect
And of endgame ever comes to hall again for some days I'll watch it and so will any marvel fan
Goodbye the original avengers you will be forever alive in my heart
I love you 3000"
2530,I confess I am not an Avengers fan having missed much of the franchise since Iron Man. However as preparation for my trip to the cinema to see Endgame I thought I would catch up on the story by watching Infinity War and Ragnarok. I actually enjoyed both of these a lot more than Endgame. It promised to be quite a spectacle and the scale of the action sequences didn't disappoint. Some of the personal stories of the characters were also introduced quite well into the film. However unlike the simpler story lines of the previous two films as mentioned I think they tried just too hard with Endgame. Too many pieces of the plot thrown into the story just made it overwhelming and took the shine off what would otherwise have been a good conclusion.
2531,"I loved this movie, it beautifully encapsulated all the movies that helped build to this point, and rewarded the ones who became fully immersed by the infinity saga.
Tony's interaction and accusation of Steve after returning to earth, removing his chest piece and telling him to hide is absolutely fantastic acting.
Scarlets performance and character arc was amazing as she selflessly saves the universe and will go down as one of the strongest female protagonists on screen.
The Timeheist scenes are a great call back and I appreciate the time they took to explain the logistics of time travel and the effect on the existing and alternative timelines created.
The final fight sequence was amazing, and was a reward to see all these stories and heroes tied together for the battle. Beautifully shot and masterfully choreographed (for most scenes) to keep the action rolling; Ending with an amazing finished to each main characters arc. A terrific movie and a justified end.My only gripe of the movie is the corny all female fight sequence. If properly executed it would have been a perfect callback to the world black widow has opened for the women of the MCU. However, all women stopping in battle and lining up was completely immersion breaking. This happens with Steve in civil war with the helicopter and Thor and starlord in specific scenes, where pandering to the audience breaks the immersion by shoehorning in politics. Anytime these scenes come on in the theatres I'm in, the audience groaned because everyone understood what they were watching. If the women line up was dynamic and moving constantly then it would of been good but they stopped the action, took us by the hand and walked us through a political shift before returning back to the movie. With strong developed females like Okoye, Scarlett witch and Valkyrie (to name a few) they don't need this level of pandering, it undermines the message of their strength and independence of men."
2532,"It's fair to say that this is a fitting climax not only to the avengers movies, but a large section of the Marvel universe. The film is action packed, generally keeps you at the edge of your seat, and remains faithful to the characters. It's long, but quite necessarily so."
2533,An experience you'll gonna remember forever and watch again and again.
2534,"First off, I enjoyed part 1 (Infinity War) like no other Marvel Universe movie. It was dark, ominous, the protagonists/heroes kept being kicked around and failing again and again. At the same time, the bad guy's ultimate motives were not-that-malevolent and adding the depth of his character (e.g. expression of love for his daughter) the result was making the viewer to like him, even if he was destroying our heroes. Unpredictable, mature, complex. Amazing.Liking that much the first movie was a tough start for part 2 -Endgame, as it might turn out not to be equally good. And it wasn't.I felt the plot this time was oriented to teens. Much more linear, super predictable, not-fresh ideas. The atmosphere was brighter, the plot shallower, the humour and acting was awkward at points. While in the first movie one hero dies in the first scene, in the second one gets getting better and better till a ""happy end"".Captain Marvel does not really participate in the movie, since she is OP (overpowered) and would ruin the balance. She just shows up to justify having her own movie and the last scene in Infinity War.If there was a cringe contest for this movie, it would be tough to decide between Thor or Hulk scenes, but first prise would definitely go to the ""all-female"" battle scene, which was there for no reason in the multiverses.All in all, the movie felt like a goodbye festival for Marvel movies, full on forced emotions, trying to explode inside you with the (very few) final casualties. But the recipe didn't work. Logan, was a success in this field, not Endgame.Watch it, just don't expect too much."
2535,"This movie was incredible, it did everything I wanted it to do and every character had their time to shine, the film was the culmination of 22 MCU films and ten years of buildup and the film pulled it off beautifully. This film could have turned out as a mess if it was in the wrong hands, but the Russo brothers have masterfully pulled off an awesome and emotionally satisfying finale to the Avengers franchise and MCU series even though we are getting more films with ""Spider-Man: A Long Way From Home"" coming out later this yearOverall, the film was everything it needed to be and the hefty 3 hour run time was definitely more than necessary. The film did everything I expected and much much more, closing a chapter on pop culture history and a franchise loved by billions, it was as close to perfect as a film like this can get"
2536,"I had high hopes.The cinematography and effects are the high-point for me. I had the opportunity to watch a 3D showing at an IMAX. No disappointment there.The cast of characters is great. The actors playing the characters are all very good. The cast is impressive. Contrary to some reviewers I even enjoyed the comic relief provided by the fat, pensive, alcoholic version of Thor.The problem for me is that Endgame dilutes the sinister conclusion of Infinity War. I loved the ending of Infinity War. When I finally decided to see Infinity War on Netflix I wasn't expecting an ending from a Marvel movie that would ask difficult questions about morality and perspective. What was annoying about Endgame is that the story uses a hokey motif like time travel to unwind the dark and sinister implications of Infinity War. It takes the uneasy moral questions left at the end of Infinity War and transforms the narrative into a flattened, predictable superhero formula written to please mass audiences."
2537,If you invested in all of the films that came before it then you will probably be very happy. Are there plot holes? Sure. Is anything in the movie probable at all in the real world? No. It's a movie. Go into it with an open mind and enjoy the ride. Nice job Russo's.
2538,"The plot itself wasn't that bad but it was somehow lazy and too convenient. Convenient for the writers to create a dramatic, tear-jerking ending and many so-much needed sacrifices. For one, it beggars belief that the team would agree upon sending two humans who hadn't been to space before to Vormir. Why did they not send Rocket or at least someone teaming up with Rocket? Why a spy and an archer? The team didn't know that a sacrifice would be required but still they sent Nat and Clint there. Too convenient. And this plot point isn't the only convenient plot point in the movie."
2539,"** some hints to spoilers but not a lot ** First, good job Marvel. You can tell from a lot of the rave reviews and the box office records that they are very effective with their Marvel Cinema Universe. You cannot deny that.However, personally, I think I out smarted myself. I read somewhere that one would not be prepared in terms of what to expect in this movie and that one would be blown away. Having read so many comics over the last 30 years, I went out to prove people wrong, and I did exactly that, predicted most of the plot points. Heheh, so i ended up a bit disappointed in the end. I probably would have enjoyed it more if i had no expectations.There were fun bits, and some wow moments, I enjoyed the Avengers Forever type plot-line, and A-Force type get together in the final battle, and finally i heard ""Avengers Assemble!"". However, I have to remember that the Russos directed this as fan boys themselves and put out what they personally wanted to see from the comics. In addition, this movie is really for those people who have been emotionally attached to the 20 so years of movies, loving certain actors/actresses, and characters.This movie was for those who were devastated or surprised by Avengers Infinity. I just don't happen to be part of that group and wanted to see a lot more deaths and hints to legacy characters. While we saw some of that - i thought they could have done more, and have a few more big sacrifices. It would not have mattered for future movies or tv series, because at one stage all of these characters have been replaced, or have successors. Final note. I still enjoyed it."
2540,"OK, here it goes. The number 1 movie in forever has had high expectations as far back as the beginning of the marvel movie universe, and I completely understand why. The previous movies have always been full of action and filled with all kinds of character development. However this is the final movie on this installment in this particular series. The last movie took several of our favorite heroes. Spiderman is gone, so are Black Panther, Doctor Strange, Groot and Bucky Barnes as well as others. So since so many of our favorites are dead what can we expect from endgame? Well, in the beginning everyone is mourning all the people who have died, unfortunately this takes up about the first 90 minutes of the movie. After we get passed the oh my God I am so sad that everyone died part of endgame we see our heroes set off to find the stones so that they can restore the universe back to the way it is supposed to be. Well Thanos will never allow this to happen, right? Well not exactly. While our friends, the Avengers set off to accomplish the impossible, it almost seems a little bit too easy at first. Sure you have a few issues, but they are the Avengers so they fix the issues rather quickly. Thanos, meanwhile is aware of what is going on and FINALLY takes action after the Avengers find all of the infinity stones. This is at the last 45 minutes or so of the movie. As the action takes place I couldn't help but think it had a Lord of the Rings meets Star Wars kind of feel. Now I won't give away the ending, but I will finish my review by saying that we lose 2 of the most iconic Avengers. Overall I enjoyed the movie, I wish it had less boohoo moments, more resistance and more action, however I am pleased with the finished product. The ending is a little bit sad and several people were crying. Hope you didn't read my review before seeing the movie. Enjoy Marvel Cinema fans. Action 6, plot 6 character development 7, cgi 10, ending 9 overall 8"
2541,"Seemed like there were many way Thanos could've been defeated at the end. Even more, what about a future where Nebula doesn't go on the mission where other Nebula can read her thoughts? Then there's no Thanos busting into the future and Iron Man doesn't have to die.
A huge disappointment, like a bad dream."
2542,"They did such a great job with infinity War that Endgame wasn't able to deliver on the same level with the added pressure of being the grand finale. Part of the problem I think was that the story was developed to such a large-scale that was hard not to be so episodic, although it probably could have been done a lot better without losing the pacing with long, drawn out and sometimes awkward scenes.Some of the scenes felt like the writers didn't know which direction to go with characters and the direction they chose was not quite right. Endgame lacked a lot of the slick and fun banter that made the characters shine in previous movies. The writers had their moments but a lot of it could be pretty cringe-worthy at times.I get that everyone needed therapy after Infinity War but it felt a little too depressing for too long. All in all end game was a a good movie and it's evident that that Disney tried to put everything but the kitchen sink in this movie to please the fans which is appreciated. But I would have loved to have seen them spend more time crafting and polishing this into the Crown Jewel it's supposed to be rather than an uncut diamond."
2543,"First off, a great applause to the members (Director, Writers, Crews, Cast etc..) behind the extraordinary movie. Avengers Endgame is a terrific example of that epic intimacy that Marvel does so well - alternating between glorious action and subtle character moments. Watching it almost feels like taking a wistful walk down memory lane, flanked on either side by a Russo brothers, our hands held firmly in theirs. . It was a perfect ""ending"" of the 21 Movies.The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. They captured the emotion perfectly. Favorite heroes once again experienced side by side and you feel it, you are completely absorbed in a hurricane of events and you are watching it in one breath.Everyone had the chance to shine even if it's the smallest way possible. There were so many character arcs in this movie and none of them were cut short or boring. Every scene is in the movie was worth digesting and deciphering, along with the surprises and the twists and turns that will get audiences on the edge of their seat. The direction focuses more on the emotional side of the characters and story. While delivering an epic climatic showdown that will have you grasping and excited.Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a great and awesome superhero film. It is one of the best finales that Joe and Anthony Russo have delivered. Thank you stan lee for making the superheroes ...."
2544,"I agree with many other reviews in that this Avengers is over hyped. However, this movie IS STILL REALLY GOOD. I think a lot of people are giving it bad reviews because people had too high of expectations. Infinty War was a lot more action-packed and became a legendary film partly because Thanos's victory had such a large ""wow factor"" to it. In terms of pure enjoyment, infinity war takes the cake. However, the plot to endgame is really good and the action scenes are still pretty amazing.Honestly, my main disappointment with this movie is what they did to Thor's character. Thor was an amazing character in IW but in endgame he is kind of pathetic, DESPITE becoming one of the most powerful avengers by the end of IW. Personally, I wish they had found a better way to use Thor's character in this movie."
2545,"Imma be honest: I was afraid this movie would be boring, overly sentimental and poorly written, but luckily IT IS NONE OF THOSE THINGS!! They managed to fill the surprisingly long run-time without boring the audience, and the plot managed to round up the character's stories very well. I was happy when I left the theatre even though the movie obviously had some sad parts. Before seeing it, I was worried I had hyped myself too much and would be disappointed, but instead I am glad that it ended in such a perfect way. Anyone who claims otherwise should be burned alive."
2546,"Alot of things could have been done better. The whole film is based on a time-travel idea that Antman came up with and Antman doesn't get enough credit or time in the film. Hawkeye gets more time in the film! Who cares about Hawkeye?! Slow in parts. Reminds me of Avengers Assemble, most of the film is build up to a final, end of film battle. Much preferred Infinity Wars pace, energy and action-packedness. Infinity War made me so excited for Endgame. Endgame made me want to rewatch Infinity War."
2547,"******** Containers Spoilers ****************So here goes with a review of the most anticipated film of all time probably? I have to say I am a fan of Superhero movies and don't worry if it is Marvel or DC but I have to say that in my opinion this movie didn't live up to the hype. Is it a bad movie? No but it is not one of Marvels finest. I am sure that hardcore Marvel fans will love it but it could (and should) have been better.It was obvious that after the events of Infinity War, Endgame had to finish with a better outcome. Obviously, time travel would be needed somewhere and true to form it was. I don't have too much of an issue with this but whilst it led to some great interaction with previous Marvel movies and TV series it also left a lot of plot holes that in the end you have to ignore so that you can enjoy the movie however as I left the movie I couldn't help thinking of how it was a little screwed up. However, we must just go with it as after all it is entertainment.One of my issues was the flow of the movie. If I am honest the first half goes a little too slow and there are some scenes that maybe didn't need to be there. I know we wanted to see the outcome of the snap but seeing all our heroes depressed wasn't necessary. Thor especially took this badly, but his humour was one of the highpoints of the film for me.The trouble with having so many Superheroes is you never really get to see enough of everyone in the film. Lots are of course missing due to the Thanos snap in IW but during the middle part we get to see lots of them but only for a limited time. The lift scene with Captain America was pure gold and seeing Tony stark with his Dad was great as well.Anyway after various escapades and 5 years our heroes gather all the stones and reverse Thanos cruel snap but we don't have time to see what happens bar for a phone call and some birds flying around as evil Thanos from 2013 manages to appear with his huge space ship and army (despite the fact they have no time machine and only one small pym particle??!!) and blow the Avengers HQ to smithereens!! Luckily??!! Not one of our heroes is injured?? And cue big fight time. Thor, Captain America and Iron Man do there best to fight with Thanos but can't beat him and just when it seems all is lost and the army of Thanos is about to lay waste to the Earth they handily wait till Doctor Strange and his friends bring back all our favourite lost heroes one at a time!!! Queue a huge CGI fest which will no doubt please action lovers everywhere. It is fun but really somethings are beyond reason. Captain America can now control Thor's hammer and Captain Marvel can come late to the party and destroy a huge spaceship in a matter of seconds but can't defeat Thanos??!! Luckily fate works that our heroes win and Thanos and his army are defeated but at a price.My worry going into this movie was that we would just get a snap, and everyone lives happily ever after and whilst we get the snap the film did give us a price to pay so can I complain no? I have to say the ending for Steve Rodgers was fantastic and well thought out (although still given the time travel issues it does leave big questions) and well deserved.Is it the best movie ever no, is it fun and does it leave us with an adequate ending to the saga yes. Given some very clever work as well to tap into previous movies I think we can give it 8/10. I would have liked more action and less despair and slowness during the first half, but you can't get everything you want. However, if we get Asgardians of the Galaxy in the near future then I will get what I want......come on Marvel that's what all the fans would love. Make our day!!!"
2548,"Steve's character has always been about self-sacrifice, from the very first movie, from his very first heroic moment that led to his becoming Captain America. His whole life is defined by doing the right thing, fighting, and saving (and sacrificing if he has to in the process of saving). Don't get me wrong: I love him and I want him to get his happy ending. But the way it is done, it just feels wrong for the character. How did we get from the Steve of all previous movies, basically, to the Steve of the end of Endgame? He went back to Peggy and had a happy and peaceful life, stayed out of all major world events and injustices for 70 years. How is that the Captain America we know and love?! There is a major development arc missing from his storyline; the same way there was a major development arc missing to expalin how he finally got worthy of Mijolnir... As a whole, Steve's character was rather flat in Endgame. What did he learn? How did he change and grow? It's not that characters have to change and evolve in every episode of a series, but such development was strongly implied when it comes to Steve Rogers in Endgame, although we never see it on the screen. The whole episode starts with Tony's accusations--so that scene was just about Tony?? What was Steve's response?--and ends with his getting worthy... how? Hmmm, how did a storyline giving my favorite MCU character all he supposedly wanted leave me so empty and unmoved? I hope the Russo brothers will get to write the jumping-between-timelines explanation they have mentioned and explain what actually happened there...Tony... After everything he's done for the world... After the glimpse we got into a happy retired family-man life for him... he deserved better. He had a plan, a family. He could have been happy without being a superhero from now on. Why couldn't he get that peace and happiness? He had grown enough over the course of the movies to finally be ready for it. I hope they'll bring him back.Alternatively, they could have let Steve sacrifice (go back in time and take Tony's place, for example) and Tony live happily with his family... It would have been painful, dramatic, and in character. I don't buy the whole Tony-was-incapable-of-self-sacrifice ""character development"" argument, when he risked his life over and over again to save the world. Last time he did was in Infinity War when he was so disappointed Dr. Strange didn't let Thanos kill him.Same with Natasha and Clint. What was the point of Nat sacrifing? If Clint had died, it would have been seen as character development and would have probably led to Natasha's further character development. Natasha's death didn't contribute to anyone's development. It was just a plot device. Therefore, just bring her back, too, and be done with character deaths in Endgame--it's a dumb trope, anyway..."
2549,Wanted to love this movie. I really did.All the Marvel movies have been great the last few years. Guardians of the Galaxy and Black Panther were superb. Infinity War was spectacular. Endgame was disappointing.Shame.
2550,"The first half felt sappy and chatty. I found myself fighting the Zzzz in this first half. But the second half felt like a time travel thriller (a la mission impossible team). The climax with the actual battle was good, like epic battles we have seen before from the Marvel Universe. I was disappointed that there wasn't an end scene. I have grown accustomed to expect an end scene leading up to a new Marvel movie so I felt jipped watching the ending credits and not seeing an end scene. I think it's like a 6 3/4 out of 10 and I rounded it up to 7/10"
2551,"In my opinion is not a good movie or a bad movie, is somewhere in the middle. I found the movie predictable, for example the scene to get the soul stone, it was obvious that black widow will be the one to die, because at the beginning of the movie, they try to give you a connection with Hawkeye by losing his family. Other example will be that their main characters like iron man will have a epic ending by dying or getting something they always wanted like capitan america.Final I have to say that the only good part of the movie is the action scene when you see all the superheroes in action. You can miss the fist hour of the movie and it wouldn't matter because is easy to explain, is enough to say that they went back in time for the infinity stones, they force thing when they go back in time to build a story."
2552,I personally preferred most of the other movies. It was just way too predictable and not that funny.
2553,"This movie was both beautiful and sad. I loved all the characters and it was a(n) (almost) perfect way to finish off phase 3 of the MCU. Tony was perfect in this movie and cried so hard when he reunited with Peter and during his funeral. I was so happy to see Peggy and Steve together and it was so nice to see Falcon take up the role of Captain America.
Thanos was more enjoyable this time round and I did enjoy seeing Ebony Maw again. Nebula had one of the best stories ever in the movie and I was rooting for her. She and Tony were the emotional centers of this film. Prof. Hulk was also genius and I loved Clint. Nat was cool too.I do have some problems with film though. First off, why hype up Captain Marvel when she was barely in the movie and what was going on with her hair? Plus all the fat jokes they used with Thor. I was not a fan of it. Thor can be fat if he want to but not just for comic relief."
2554,"In my opinion, Infinity War is the best Marvel movie, not this one. I enjoyed the long runtime, as this is the last avengers movie, however they did not take advantage of that. The movie took a very long time to get going and they rushed all of the action into the end. All the characters that were brought back had almost no screen time because they all had to share it in about 40 minutes.The main thing that I didn't like was that the movie was immature. The jokes were great, as they always are in a marvel movie but maybe this time they went a little overboard. This was supposed to be the conclusion of a decade of movies but it was overshadowed by some of the immature jokes. The one I hated the most was that Thor was fat for the whole movie. It was funny at first but I feel like they could have made him fit again at the part where he summons the lightning and his armor at the end. Also I didn't like how Bruce was the Hulk the whole movie. Like Thor, he should not have been like that for the entire movie.The relationship between Hawkeye and black widow was great and the Budapest line was a nice touch, as the movie can't full circle. Black widow's death however was brushed over in way and once again overshadowed by Tony's death.Another big problem is that the ending didn't make a lot of sense. After everyone was snapped back to life, they were put in a world that had turned into a wasteland after five years, where everyone had aged but they didn't. How is it that Peter just goes back to school the next day as if nothing had happened? Not only should half of his class mates be 5 years older, but the school would most likely not even function, as all the governments of the world collapsed.Finally, during this movie we saw the immense power that the infinity stones have all together. If they were used to wipe out half of all life, bring them back, then wipe out Thanos's army, then can't they also bring back Tony and Nat?In conclusion, I enjoyed watching this movie very much. I just feel like the movie was more serious and dark, like Infinity War was. Putting all these points aside, I would definitely recommend this movie to people and would watch it again myself."
2555,"""Endgame"" starts out well, presenting a credible atmosphere of doom and gloom in the wake of our heroes' colossal failure at the end of Infinity War. Much of the first act concerns grief and coping strategies, and Thanos creator Jim Starlin aptly gets a cameo as part of a support group, much to the delight of long-time Marvel fans.Then Ant-Man somehow pops out of the quantum realm and everything soon falls apart, in terms of a coherent narrative. If you're in this mainly for sheer emotion and fan-pleasing gestures, you'll still love it. But if you give the plot twists much thought, you won't.The characters make fun of time-travel movies such as ""Back to the Future"" ... but then go on to set wholly new standards for convoluted, improbable, and paradoxical time conundrums that no amount of explaining can address, and appealing to ""alternate realities"" splitting off is just hand-waving here. Nebula kills her earlier self but is unaffected? Thanos from 2014 is killed in 2023, so Infinity War is erased ... along with everything that this movie is supposed to be correcting. Most grievously of all, Cap goes completely against character and decides to lead a normal life in the past (irresponsibly neglecting the threats of the Red Skull, Hydra, etc.), thereby erasing his solo trilogy of films and much more. And so on.In addition, Thor is treated miserably, having been turned by the writers into a fat slob wallowing in self-pity and despair, even though early on he avenges the Snap he had just barely failed to prevent. This is the same guy who showed up in Wakanda? And Thanos, after Brolin's brilliantly nuanced portrayal in Infinity War, is pretty much reduced to a cardboard villain as well as in stature.Throughout, stuff just happens without adequate preparation or internal logic. I loved the scene in ""Age of Ultron"" when Cap was barely able to budge Thor's hammer, much to the thunder god's momentary chagrin. But now Cap can suddenly wield it effortlessly in combat? How convenient. And how exactly does Stark get the Infinity Stones from Thanos and do so all at once without being disintegrated, or at the very least majorly stunned, by their titanic power? Even if we accept the improbable sleight-of-hand here, recall how stunned Thanos himself was each time he acquired just a single gem. But Stark can acquire all six at once and not blink an eye? I guess we're supposed to be too caught up in the moment, loving the ""poetic justice"" of situations, to think about these improbabilities and internal inconsistencies. But a better version of this film would have been written in such a way that it both pleases and makes sense, at least in its own established fantasy terms.Frankly, you could easily navigate a space shuttle through the gaping plot holes in this narrative, and that's a serious problem. I could have focused more on some of the movie's strengths, such as some of the performances, the epic effects, and Silvestri's powerful score, but for me, this was certainly not the satisfying final act I had been hoping for."
2556,"Good movie. A good ending to a great saga Loved the acting and direction was superb but the length of the movie was tediously long. the movie fails to keep the tempo. The character arch of some were strangely distorted. overall a great movie. loved the ending. Tony Stark, Captain America, thor, Hulk, Black widow and Hawkeye will always remain in our hearts."
2557,"No spoilers!!Being a sceptic of Marvel movies for a long time, I had low expectations going into Endgame. I didn't love Infinity War, but I wanted to see this film opening weekend to avoid spoilers and see how the 10-year culmination of the MCU concluded. Well, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. It's not without its issues, but Endgame felt like one of the most unique and captivating Marvel films to date. I was very surprised at how easily I was engaged throughout the 3-hour runtime. The film breaks down into three parts, each part having its pros and cons. Personally, I thought the first act was the weakest and overstayed its welcome. Despite that, there were still some interesting parts that helped flesh out the aftermath of Infinity War. The second and third act felt very original and had many surprising moments that kept me guessing what would happen next. However, there were parts that felt VERY fan servicey. Of course, some of the fan service was fine, but at other points it felt like a little much.One of the great things about this movie was that it broke from the simple MCU formula. It has a much different story than any of the other MCU films and utilizes much different plot mechanisms to make it feel more original. The emotional range of the film was another thing that felt different to me compared to many other MCU films. I thought the humor in this film was handled much better, causing me to laugh multiple times. Not only was the film funny at points, but it also had some sad, depressing, exciting, and thrilling sequences. This film, unlike some other MCU films, was able to have some very serious moments and did not have to cut the emotional tension by inserting a cheesy one-liner.Despite it being a much more original and emotionally driven film compared to other MCU films, it did have some shortcomings. I think that some of the fan service took me out of the film because it felt either overdramatic or forced. There were times were I caught myself rolling my eyes at how overdramatic or socially 'woke' the movie was being. One scene in particular felt like a blatant advertisement in the middle of the film, which was jarring and cringe worthy. There were also many moments of the film that could have been explained to help bring more tension, but instead were brushed over in order to fit everything into a reasonably lengthed film. I think there were parts that should have been cut or shorted and other parts that should have been extended. Lastly, I thought that Thanos was misused in this film. I was excited to see his role in this film but was left disappointed by his role as the villain.As someone who wouldn't consider themselves a Marvel fan, I had fun watching this movie regardless of it having some issues. I would definitely recommend it if you have been following the MCU at all recently, but I probably don't need to do that because everyone and there mother is going to see this. Overall, I thought it was enjoyable and quite possibly my favorite Marvel film.P.S. It feels satisfying to have this chapter of superhero movies come to a close. I hope that it will make way for more innovative and interesting films, whether they are superhero related or not."
2558,"Horrible movie, ruined what could have been a great infinity war movie...timeline story lines work if it's simple and straightforward, but with something as involved as Avengers time travel was a hacky technique to use resolve Thanos's decision. Lame. If time travel is the solution to anything bad, why have villains at all? These writers have destroyed the marvel universe movies forever. The only reason it's a 4 out of 10 is all the other movies that helped build characters."
2559,"Movie wasnt bad but it was def overhyped..Ending was great..Cant really beat Cap saying ""Avengers Assemble"" but still..Hawkeye I thought too much screen time..Some parts were generally boring, probably not enough action overall IMO..Beginning was kind of boring I thought..I definitley liked Infinity War better..Expected a lot more after IW but this didnt live up to what I had hoped for but meh I'll still go see it again so somehow it wins in the end..lol 🤣🤣🤣"
2560,"The end of an era! The hard core fans will absolutely love endgame as it's really does round of the series with awesome cameos from various films. If you've been attached to the MCU through out and watched all the others, you'll love this. (Visiting Guardians 1 or Avengers Assemble) However if you're a casual fan you may not get as excited when Captain America says ""Avengers assemble"". A line we've all been waiting for since the beginning, or appreciating Captain America welding the Mjolnir since the teaser from Age of Ultron.However it's not as fast paced as infinity war and more predictable than infinity war. We knew someone would die at Volmir for example and very likely Stark would be a sacrifice due to strange handing over the time stone. The film started off slow, however had an awesome finish!Overall film is 8/10 from me! I think the film was amazing, but perhaps needed to be little more faced paced like infinity war and less character development (we've had 22 movies) well worth watching!"
2561,"It is indeed a fan-desired perfect end to a superbely balanced cinematic experience. A well hammer-hit nail to the hall of fame of Marvel movies but as a movie on its own it is indeed a 7 for me. As a wise man once put, ""too many cooks spoil the food"" is the perfect epigram to how I felt (mind you) ""watching the movie in it's own original form."""
2562,Gonna keep it simple here.. The movie is awesome.. Some people may say the movie got plotholes here and there but no.. The plotholes are negligible.. And all make senses. Better than Infinity Wars.. And i don't know what future lies ahead after the ending of Endgame. Would it be better with new line? I hope so.. But this movie really sum up all the hard work of 11 years of MCU. Thank You RDJ for starting all of this.
2563,"Considering the huge cliffhanger in IW, the expectations are enormous. Unfortunately, the movie is not living up to them at all.By destroying some characters and a very questionable plot (soo many holes in it) and 2h of boredom I must say, I do not agree with many people here that this was the perfect ending to the last 10 years..."
2564,"Infinity War was the best Marvel movie ever made. The Russo brothers did a fantastic job at storytelling all those characters in one movie. But in Endgame they have just ruined some of the Character developments they produced in Infinity War.What I liked:
1. Endgame is definitely the funniest Movie in the MCU. Even more so than Thor: Ragnarok. As much as I loved the comic relief in that movie, Endgame just seems more like a comedy than just comic relief which isn't entirely a good thing as I'll explain later.
2. Having the Avengers travel back in time to previous MCU movies was ingenious. It really gave me a warm fuzzy feeling revisiting those movies.
3. When Captain America weilds Thor's Hammer I got goosebumps all over. Such a great scene. I loved that Cap got to have a proper equal fight with Thanos and making him a large part in defeating Thanos.
4. Hawkeye's Character was really developed upon in this movie. He was more badass and I loved that he also had a large part in Endgame and wasn't just simply shooting arrows as he does in the other Avenger movies.
5. Having Ironman destroy Thanos and his Army was the single greatest thing the Russo brothers did. Yes he is my favourite alongside Thor but since he was the first to start off the Franchise he definitely has the right to finish it off.
6. I liked that Captain Marvel didn't have much air time she doesn't really connect with the other characters her powers are too celestial and doesn't fit with the rest of the Cast and also she just seems abit too dry for my liking. So cheers for that.
Dislikes:
1. Although Thor was hilarious they should not have let him fight Thanos at the end in his obese state. It looked so strange and I just kept thinking he looked exactly like Volstagg from Warriors Three. Taika recreated Thor in Ragnarok and made him more connecting with the audience and gave him that human element, which was great. Then the Russo's developed on that in Infinity War giving Thor that amazing scene when he enters Wakanda. Now in Endgame they just make him a joke. Yes I laughed so much in his scenes but before he fought Thanos they should have transformed him back to normal. He's meant to be a God so there were so many ways the Russo's could have transformed him back without making the audience think that it was too unrealistic.
2. In Infinity War Bruce Banner was having issues with the Hulk possibly because the Hulk kept thinking he was being used only when he was needed to solve the problem. In any case I thought it was great that they did that as it gave me such anticipation to see him unleash in Endgame. I assumed he was going to have a massive battle with Thanos after his transformation into the Intelligent Hulk. Especially as Thanos made a full of him in Infinity War. But in Endgame they made him seem like a joke aswell. Yes he was also hilarious at the beginning and ofcourse we need that comic relief it just adds to the character development and makes us more connected to him but we call them superheroes for a reason. We want to see more from them than just comic relief. He had no serious action sequences at all. He was just dismissed in the end battle scene.
3. Having Captain America go back to put the Infinity Stones in there rightful place was great. But then he lives a life with Peggy and re appears back as an old man. That was so depressing I can't even begin to tell you how dissatisfied I was with seeing him so old. I understand that they had to write him off as Chris Evans time with Marvel has come to an end. But what would have been less depressing was seeing his shield left on the bench with a note left for Falcon and as he's reading the note Steve is dancing with Peggy. Atleast we would remember him as a young man. Now all I'm going to remember is Cap as an old weak man.
4. I left the worst for last. Ironman dies!!! Yes I know we saw this coming especially from Infinity War when he's almost killed from Thanos. But a character so beneficial to the Franchise, how can you kill him off? Even if you were to kill him off that way. What was to stop Dr. Strange from grabbing the Time stone and reversing Time only on Tony To bring him back to life. The exact same way Thanos did to Vision in Infinity War. Doesn't make sense that Dr. Strange wouldn't think of that.There's so many good elements in Endgame but they just couldn't produce the homerun that they did in Infinity War."
2565,"Other than time traveling, everything else was reasonably good. Time traveling can never give clear answers, but only make more questions."
2566,"I'm sorry, i only got 10/10.. if i could, i'll give you 11/10. :)
The very best way to ending your Infinity Saga.."
2567,"Maybe it's because they overdid marketing on this movie and it ended up raising my expectations to ridiculous levels, but I was honestly disappointed when I watched the movie. The final battle was... Boring. And I get that you're all for feminism nowadays, but do you really need to repeat the whole ""us girls got your back"" scene like you did in Infinity War?"
2568,"First of all, I have to agree on the comments that first half of this movie is really slow. There is only 10 minutes of action throughout entire 1,5 hours. However, it doesn't bore you, instead it helps you focus on characters and their feelings after they lost their friends and families because of Thanos.Remaining Avengers members try to figure out a way to undo what Thanos did. Although most of us guessed what they were gonna do, the way they do it has a lot more to offer than you can imagine. That's where things starts to refer to almost every previous Marvel movies. It makes you laugh, surprise and cry.You don't have to be a pure Marvel fan to enjoy it. Don't want to spoil it, just go and see it."
2569,"Movie is a little long. There are scenes that could have been made shorter or cut out completely.
A LOT of exposition. Feels like we're being spoon fed what they are planing to do the majority of the movie.
A cringe worthy feminist girl moment that makes your eyes roll. There was no subtlety there.
The movie was a little messy with pacing but show a lot of heart.There were two characters that I took a little issue with.
Captain Marvel- Irritating and nasty with the few lines she does have. Really felt Brie Larson bleeding through the character with comments like ""well, you didn't have me last time"". I feel no respect for this character or actress and hope they remove her sooner rather than later.Thor- Funny but the character seems to be dumbed down a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan and enjoy humor but this schtick went on a little too long.This movie has a lot of really solid comedy, heart felt moments, and action. Yeah it has some plot holes but the over all story is good and a fair way to end Phase 4."
2570,"What is there to say about the ending to a film series that defined an entire new chapter of Hollywood? It's difficult to process everything that happens in Endgame, but that's to be expected from a film of this scale. It's enthralling and unforgettable - get ready to feel EVERY emotion!"
2571,"No spoilers here. 22 movies, 11 years, and multiple story arcs to tie together. A MASSIVE and record breaking task. Not only that, but I was expecting a lot and got MORE than what I expected. Infinity war was incomplete (on purpose). Unfortunately it just didn't feel like a complete story. This movie is a complete story in and of itself, and it ties in well. More action, more acting, good humor, and TIME TRAVEL!! Also, no credit scenes. This is the end of the current Avengers saga as we know it. Expect teasers for the next team, but don't expect any hints of the next saga's story."
2572,"After reading a lot of these reviews, it feels like a lot of people are judging this movie as a cultivation of all Marvel movies, not as a movie by it self.I personally was board after the first 30 minutes and could'nt feel so much for the characters, when you know (unless you are a child), that everyone will be brought back. There were a lot of thing that didn't either make sense or were really counting on us to suspend our belief.It was a solid movie, but I don't understand how people would put it up as one of the top movies of all time. To say that this was a better action / fantasy movie than LOTR or Pulp Fiction is a gross overstatement. 'm convinced, people won't be watching it in 10 years time and it will be more or less forgotten."
2573,Every character's superpowers are ruined.. too messy for a so called best of the best.. comedies arnt on point..
2574,Hyper ratings are not realistic it wont go over 8.5 for me
2575,"After how awesome Infinity War was, I was expecting so much more from Endgame, but maybe that's my fault. I'll not list all the faults as most people have covered them in their reviews (and they are all correct). 3 hours of movie and only about 15 minutes of that is action. Strangest thing is Thanos' strength and power.......seems to match whoever he is fighting at the time, whether with or without infinity stones, 1 opponent or 5, it just doesn't make sense and don't get me started on timelines or Captain Marvel!!"
2576,"We have laughed, cried and rejoiced during the whole journey of 22 movies and have lived through them. It have now become a part of us and I just hope that our future generations can understand and feel the things which we understood at times and felt !!!Here's to Us who witness the end of an ERA !!!"
2577,"Death of iron man and black widow made whole theatre cry... It's gonna be the 1 of the best movie in entire superhero movies industry
Movie was fun, emotional, awesome fight scenes
And all of the above tony hugging spider man"
2578,"There will be a lot of people gushing on here about this movie. Make no mistake, it was good, just not great. 21 films leading up to this point have built the tension, and what should have been a sonic boom was closer to a car backfiring. At three hours, this is a long movie. While there are moments of great humor and great sadness and great happiness, it also dragged in spots. One would expect it to be 95% action, but they spent a lot of time on fluff. Again, do not misunderstand me. I liked this movie quite a bit, but I wanted to love it, and sadly I didn't."
2579,"Best marvel movie ever, conclusion of the 21 marvel movies don't think much just go for it 😍😍💟💟"
2580,"All I can say is, if you haves loved the MCU over the past decade, this movie will be everything you need it to be as a fan. Perfectly executed. The attention to detail by the Russo brothers is evident and beautiful. Never thought I'd say that as a 40 year old mom of 4. MCU is more than a bunch of comic book characters, they have developed these characters over the years so that by the time Endgame happened, as a fan, you are invested in who these heroes are as people and not just their incredible superhero abilities. My advice: fans, avoid spoilers! And for those reviewing, good or bad, keep the details of the movie to yourself. The film will be more meaningful to the fans if they get to experience it oblivious to how it all goes down. Can't wait to go back and see it again. Prediction: biggest movie of all time!!"
2581,"First off, I would like to get somethings off my chest. I'll admit, in terms of a pure film I feel that Infinity War was better as a whole than Endgame. I found Endgame to be quite predictable throughout and I felt that it suffered more with Marvel's usual pacing issues more so than IW. While enjoyable, I felt that this film pushed the comedic tones a little bit too much for my taste compared to the previous film and disrupted the overall balance.However, this film still defied my already sky high expectations. Endgame did exactly what the title said.. it was the Endgame and boy was it a sight to behold. From the bombastic fight scenes and the intersecting complexities between each character, the film never ceased to excite. In many ways, what Endgame did right was it took the spectacle that was Infinity War and somehow took it to an even bigger notch. I found the film to be overall a lot more memorable than its previous counterpart. Throughout its 3 hour run time (which honestly didn't even feel like it, time felt like a breeze inside the theater), I felt that the film as a whole was much more compelling and contained more scenes that constantly put me in the edge.Such a statement is quite daring to make, but I felt that Endgame did an absolutely remarkable job in leaving so much distinct and vivid imagery. A film of this magnitude is meant to be a spectacle, an emotional joyride, and a bonafide table-setter all bundled into one roller coaster of a ride and such expectation was met tenfold.What I also loved about Endgame was that it beautifully ended so many prominent character arcs, while also establishing the foundations for the new era of Marvel films. I especially loved all the subtle and not so subtle callbacks to the past films in the series, which is quite a treat for long time fans like me. These are not the easiest to achieve in film, but the Russo Brothers did an amazing job in piecing 11 years of cinema history in order to project the absolute perfect finale to one of the most iconic franchises in the history of cinema.Overall, it's not a perfect film by any stretch but it's impossible not to give it a 10/10. Endgame is supposed to tie up all the loose ends and questions from the 23 other movies in the MCU, which it accomplishes beautifully. It isn't as fine polished and clean as IW, but it didn't need to be. Endgame set out to do the job and it passed with an array of flying colors. To all the twist and turns throughout the 11 years since the MCU was firmly described, I can easily say that one of the most epic nights of my life. Fans old and new fans can easily appreciate how epic of a film this is. Marvel knew what was needed to be done in terms of making the infinity saga happen and it was absolutely worth the wait. This era of the MCU is going to be surely missed and I cannot thank Marvel Studios enough for a hell of a ride. This might be the Endgame, but it has and will continue to be worth every second of anyone's time."
2582,"Where to begin. This movie was everything I wanted and more. It was unpredictable, kept me guessing and was full of action and character driven moments. The story was the perfect conclusion to the characters we know and love and the epic storyline built over eleven years. There was only small nitpick I had about the movie, but to reveal it would spoil the experience that is Avengers: Endgame. The acting is phenomenal. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evens, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner all give 110%, as does the supporting cast. The way this film wrappes up the journies of the characters we've known for so long is beautiful. All of the characters could not have had better endings. The film is heartbreaking, exciting and well written. It's deserves all the praise it's getting. See this film, now! Before someone spoils it and because it needs to be seen on the big screen. Trust me, the climax is one of the biggest and most exciting climaxes put to film. This is the best film in the MCU, the best film of 2019 so far and will most likely continue being so and it is one of my personal favourite movies, I enjoyed it that much. 10/10. Book tickets as soon as you've finished reading this. It'll be the most exciting 3 hours of your life."
2583,"I am trying to be honest and being objective as much as I can : this movie is EPIC, I am sure ever single person in the world who has watched it will be pleased and satisfied. It was a complete emotion-packed movie.It has a few flaws, I am sure some Marvel fans feel it too, some may be annoyed by the flaws (the directors should have done this, done that, why not this, why not that, minor plot holes, etc) but all was paid off by its EPIC-ness.PS : I felt empty after I watched the Endgame, even until I write this review. It is not because I don't like the movie, it is just because I am not sure whether the next MCU saga will be as GREAT and EPIC as this. Good luck for the future MCU !!"
2584,"One of the best (if not the best) final acts in superhero movies. Russo Bros did it very brilliantly. ""Captain America is Worthy"" scene is one of the best CBM moments of all time. Full marks for that. The final war scene, the digital cinematography, the colors look so beautiful and expensive.Tony Stark/Iron Man is one true hero and leader 'not actually, but you'll see and feel' in the MCU since 2008. Robert Downey Jr. was outstanding in the Endgame. He deserves all the popularity and respect from the fans. His every scene was good.
Captain America comes at number 2. He looks tensed through-out the movie, so does Black Widow, as we all know he knows his responsibilities. He is the man of honor.
Clint Barton/Hawkeye/Ronin comes at number 3. Somehow sometimes I found The Ant-Man's character very serious here. Paul Rudd was amazing as Scott Lang.
Spider-Man was so powerful and impressive in his very limited role.
The Hulk taking Time stone, Clint and Nat's Vormir visit, Tony met his father again, Captain vs Captain, Cap/Tony/Thor fighting Thanos scenes were mind-blowing.The characters disappointed me, are-Captain Marvel. I seriously believe that Russo Bros can make Endgame without her. Never felt her worth in this film. Not in a single scene. Well, They could use Pepper Potts to 'rescue' Tony Stark. Also when she makes an appearance in the final battle, was also useless, we realize that later.
Thor. Thor is a comedian after Ragnarok. I don't know why they did this to him, what's wrong with the ""fun-loving"" studio; although Thor has some very good action scenes, just action scenes.
Hulk. They ruined the Professor Hulk for me. The arc was missing even he had a very big role though. But he was just another comedian.
Black Panther. His one scene was good from his very limited role. I feel that only Russo did justice to his powers as we saw him in Civil War and Infinity War and now this.The characters I wanted to see more, are-
Thanos. He impressed again in the fight scenes and that dialogue before the battle.
Pepper Potts in the Iron suit.
Spider-Man.
Loki.
Nick Fury at the end.Things I didn't like-
This is not how Time-Travel works. They showed it like it is just a children's game. I expected more for Tony's rescue scene, It was pretty disappointing for me. Some scenes in the 1st act looked stretched and unnecessary.
Tony Stark's death could have been more emotional, I felt that scene where he hugs Spider-Man was better than Pepper talking him for the last time. I am a very emotional person but haven't felt much emotion in that scene.
I didn't like the 'after battle scenes' or you can say 'the conclusion scenes' except ""The New Captain America"" scene, that was so powerful and emotional. Captain-Peggy scene could have been better, as the fan-theory says.Well, concluding my view on Endgame by saying ""Go and watch it on the biggest screen possible"". That's it."
2585,"Fight scenes weren't satisfactory enough, it should included more epic clashes.
Didn't like the new Hulk.
Dr Strange didn't show up much"
2586,"A Malaysian reviewer here. Screening on the 24th April 2019 and All i can say it is a behemoth undertaking compiling 21 or so films, expanding over 11 years of MCU phase 1 and phase 2 universe. How the heck are they going to pull this off? Questions arise and questions being answered with a 3 hour long movie. Its a good solid 3 hour marvel movie.A good slow pace on the first part showing human vulnerability on superheroes. Even superheroes need emotional support from someone. Its is nice to see Hawkeye got some good character scene compared to his last/ previous involvement.Second part comes the built up whereby it is fun to see how they interact with previous marvel films. (note to those don't follow MCU universe) You really need to see few previous marvel films to understand further what i am talking about.The Third act is the final act whereby the brothers did a terrific job giving what fans wanted. An awesome (+/-)45 minutes battle that exceed my expectation. Crazy visual effect/ CGI . Such an eye candy to see on the big screen.All i can say this movie is well worth the 11 years of waiting and the screenwriters and directors did very well in showing off the maturity of marvel MCU films. It is like having all favorite songs and compile it as your greatest hits. This is how endgame felt like to me. It is just so freaking awesoommeeeeeeeeeee"
2587,"For 11 years marvel has been building up for their epic finale and it is almost safe to say they nailed it
With an emotional roller-coaster, breathtaking soundtracks and epic scenes and fight sequences that will be the standard against which all the upcoming movies of this genre is held, Marvel delivered the superhero movie of the decade
However, the plot felt a little forced as they were constantly trying to provide the perfect finale - which they almost did -, they filled the movie with plot drivers to reach the epic peak of Marvel cinematic universe
But all in all I can safely say that it's one of the best movies I've ever seen and it can probably withstand the test of time as people at different times can sit at the edges of their seats as they see the ""AVENGERS ASSEMBLE""."
2588,"This is for the MCU fans, a truly heartfelt, emotional 3 hour journey into characters we have grown to love over the last 11 years.
It's not perfect, they took huge risks, some I didn't like, others I loved!
A Few things to know:
It's light on action (until the last hour) In favour of telling a slower story and letting the characters simmer in a scene.
Take tissues
Don't take a toilet break
There are no after credit scenes.
Overall I loved this movie. It's a fantastic and satisfying conclusion. 9/10
Where I rank this in the 4 Avengers movies - 1st
Where I rank this in the MCU - 2nd"
2589,"This film is hard to talk about without spoiling it, it is a 3 hour movie and the furthest I'll go in terms of talking about what is in the movie, is to say that we have seen nothing of it from the trailers. The movie is very heartfelt, and that's performed by the excellent character development. Throughout the years of the MCU, you feel like you know these characters, but not that personally, and this film definitely fills the missing gap there. We actually get to see these characters not fighting, doing things many of us wouldn't imagine and it makes these guys we have seen on the big screen for the past 11 years so much more lovable. This movie is also truly ror the fans, coming into this movie with not much knowledge about Marvel wouldn't make you feel the same way of the movie that a fan would in terms of understanding and emotions. Avengers: Endgame is pieced together masterfully, by the Russo Brothers, who I must acknowledge for directing a movie like this. They did an excellent job with pacing, plot and keeping the whole 3 hours completely discrete and unpredictable. This movie very much feels like a culmination of what the past 11 years, and 22 movies in the MCU have lead up to. The final act is absolutely astounding, and really shows you what the MCU has come to, being one of my favourite scenes from not only all of the MCU but also that I've ever seen. Make sure not to miss a single minute of this movie, with all of it being important. This movie was so close to being perfect, making the right choices, bringing an emotional tone we've never had before and so much more that worked, but there were a few tiny problems. Firstly, CGI seems a little bit off in some or the scenes, which is a bit disappointing but minor enough to the point that no casual watcher would notice. Second, some of their jokes just don't land, especially in one scene at the very end. Third, it feels like it could be a bit shorter, with some scenes in the second half that didn't really matter. Overall, this movie is astounding, but only for Marvel fans. The 3 hours doesn't feel that long whatsoever, maybe feeling a bit long towards the end, but the movie keeps to be very entertaining all the way throughout. Avengers: Endgame is the best representation of Marvel as a whole, and is easily the best MCU movie yet, with Captain America: Civil War right below it. There are many theories online, and I'm aware of most of them, I can confirm that nearly all of them aren't even close or barely play a part in the movie. It definetely will hold up as the best movie of 2019, and I can't wait to see what's in store for the MCU. Keep in mind, there's no after credits, it doesn't matter how long you stay. Besides, the very final scene itself feels like an after credits scene."
2590,"I'll keep this short and spoiler free.Simply, it doesn't compare in story, performances, characters, structure, or even excitement to Infinity War. Infinity War far surpassed expectations on all fronts where unfortunately Endgame comes short.It's a fun movie and there's great and powerful moments. But ultimately there wasn't nearly enough suspense, and the plot was far too messy and borderline lazy.It was a good movie but I'm sad to say a disappointment in regards to what came before and in regards to the place it holds now in the history of the MCU.If you're just looking for a fun movie and are willing to ignore major plot holes, lazy story elements, and lacklustre character choices hopefully you can enjoy it for what it is. But it's no Infinity War; and although it has redeeming elements (which on their own could've been part of a great film) it's overall a disappointment. Lower your expectations. I hope you like it better than I did."
2591,"After staying up to watch the premiere of the avengers: the end game, the tears and laughs flew together, and the drama was handled super well. Every hero has his own shining points and impressive stunts. Although there are some bugs in the plot, but for the sake of eleven years' feelings and the final curtain call of the original avengers six, all the five-star praise! Some people live, some people die, some people are old, some people live in the past, there are humanized gray, some people died twice, some life and death unknown, some reunion, some curtain call, some people handover, some people are pleased!
Seeing iron man and nebula stranded together in outer space for five years is a tear-filled experience. Seeing captain marvel carry iron man's spaceship back to earth, captain America and iron man meet again after the civil war, he could not help tears in his eyes. Tears of joy as the avengers travel back in time to see Loki reappear; To see the black widow and hawkeye in order to obtain the soul gem to sacrifice their own, to save each other's friendship, tears; See the widow sister sacrifice themselves, eagle eyes to obtain soul gem, tears wet eyes; ""I'm iron man"" becomes the biggest tear in a movie about the man who put on infinite gloves to turn the world around and sacrificed himself to save the world. To see captain America return to the past to escort the original place of the original stone chose to stay in the past to make up for the rescue of the unfinished love, back to the present, old age, tears in the corner of his eyes! I believe that the tin can and the widow sister will not be sacrificed like this, they are just in another parallel time still busy in the laborious mission of saving the world!
Ant-man, hulk, thor, and starlord are the punchline! Shield iron masochistic sweet, eagle few masochistic sweet, hammer base did not meet again, ant and wasp female husband and wife file tacit understanding is very! Iron man's daughter may inherit the mantle ironman, falcon inherited the mantle of the captain America, valkyries took over lagarde, expanding the thor joined the mouth alliance galaxy convoy, captain marvel has always been the existence of the fate of the bug, Loki living in the past, scarlet witch didn't wait for the resurrection of op, star jue also begging for card magic pull the miracle of the resurrection!

2592,"This is the only way this marvelous, compelling, heroic story could end."
2593,"One word for Captain marvel (Booorrring) not worth it to have too much power...Rating By performance and Action...Captain America 10/10 My Fav.

2594,"After watching the premiere tonight, this movie is the best one I have ever seen, Better than Dark Knight. The laughter is on another level with some serious cry because we are in the endgame now, it is expected. The way they have assembled all the 21 movies in 1 epic 3 hour screenplay is completely mind blowing and astonishing. The Russo brothers are pure epitome of perfection to showcase MCU at its best. Thank you MARVEL STUDIOS and STAN LEE for giving us such epicness. Some might not like it, might not remember about it but not us - is what I will tell myself even after 10 more years."
2595,"People in the cinema were shouting and crying for joy when the Avengers who died came back to fight with Thanos. It was the best audience reaction I've ever seen! Was wondering though how Captain Marvel was able to control the Mjolnir. Unexpected deaths, two among the Avengers, and unexpected ending with regard to Steve Rogers and Hawkeye. Was expecting that Capt. Marvel would be the one to defeat Thanos, but it wasn't the case. Overall, the movie was enjoyable."
2596,"No matter what you think you can expect about Marvel Studios' Avengers: Endgame movie, the movie will be far from your expectations!Just try to remember the main characters in the last 20 movies before watching it."
2597,This is one of the best action/superhero movies I have ever seen. It wraps the infinity saga up real good.
2598,"In many ways what this film does is to be respected, yet many of its scenes are also messy and get to be too convoluted."
2599,This was the best marvel film I have ever seen and the action was off the charts I just don't like what they did to carol's hair at all.
2600,"Movie is predictable and there is lots of story instead of fighting scenes. I like to roll of thor and hulk, they both were good. however, I feel that movie focus more on female which is really strange. I dont like the Doctor strange screen time it was hardly 1 minute (should be more)
overall for me infinity war wins the race but still it was great ride. Good Work and good ending. Could be better!"
2601,"The movie does have lots of people in it, but Thor is a real joke, and under used, and Hulk too, what where they thinking, also Captain America uses Thor hammer.....The movies lacks what all other movies had action, lots of it, now its replace by useless long and boring chats, the action is missing in most part of the movie.... Also the fact that the movie is 3 plus hours long........Very over rated movie."
2602,"Great movie to bring your girl/mom to watch: she will love it, she will cry and laugh a lot as the plot is full or emotional/soap opera and cheesy jokes
Main mistake would be to watch it on IMAX - I regret that - I just assumed this was a great movie to watch on IMAX/laser but it looks awful on the big screen: closeups are not terrible but I guess it may look OK only on small screens - it seems it was filmed with a dash camera! Watching it 3D would be another mistake I guess
So don't expect much of this one on a big screen and just go for a cheap ticket, even youtube would do if you just want to watch it
Regarding the plot - pretty sure it was written by an old lady, it has a lot of emotional soap opera stories - was this supposed to be that? action scenes are like written by someone that never watched any action movie
As an action movie is just average, after 2 hours of soap opera finally some action that is a mix of whatever, the bad guy is not even scary or bad
Most characters appear to be like constipated, depressed or on drugs, like if the bad guy (Thanos) erased 50% of their coolness
Special effects are just average as well, but at least there is some fight, nothing worth high resolution screen anyway
If you loved Thor: Ragnarok this is the movie for you but if you are after an intense action movie - don't expect much of this one
Again, this is a great movie to bring your girl - she will love it"
2603,"God damn I laughed and I cried and I laughed and I cried, now I'm watching it for the second time, probably the third, I can't even remember how many times...."
2604,The film has no pace besides the big battle that in fact is to short and feels like nothing according to what I expected for a new fight with e thanosSome character directions of important heroes like Thor and hulk where ridiculous . And these characters contributed nothing to the stories besides transmitting weaknessAlso the movie was overwhelmed by overpowering woman and non white characters . I understand the need to give equal importance to every king of heroe but not to the cost of the most importa ones .Also the script was full of things without logic
2605,"Avenged Endgame serves as a super nice popcorn movie. But the building-up for the final battle happens way too slow, way too dull. The battle itself is epic but ends too soon in my opinion. Some of the punchlines in the film seem too contrived and almost bored me into tears. The movie tries to dig in all the main characters but fails to convey the depth. With that said, the visual and sound effects do deserve being appreciated in an IMAX movie theater."
2606,"Thank you Russo brothers! Thank you for living up the dream of every Marvel fans! I am not sure if there will be a better movie than this in the upcoming years. But this has got to be the best superhero comic movie ever made! If you are hyped with all this reviews coming in, you have another thing coming your way. Stop whatever you are doing and do whatever it takes to the watch this epic movie of the year! A finale well written and a movie worth every penny of your money. Bring your kids, family, friends and have the best 3 hours of your life like i did. We were never ready for this. We never did.... #WhateverItTakes #Endgame"
2607,"This was the best adieu to last 11 years of marvel. It was emotional, i can still feel the gossebumps. It had its own flaws and I didn't get 1 or 2 answers i was looking in this movie but in the end I was satisfied, the second half went on another level and some set pieces will be remembered for years to come.
Once in a decade a movie in this genre comes who defines the genre, the previous 10 years was The Dark Knight from this year onwards it would be Endgame."
2608,"Just when you thought they may not live up to the hype,
Just when you thought they have already done it all and there's nothing else that's gonna surprise you,
Marvel does it again.
Absolutely the best superhero movie ever!"
2609,No spoilers at all just go and watch this immensely epic culmination to the saga. Truly breathtaking. Just wow.
2610,"People laughed, clapped their hands, some of them cried (including me). And what a satisfying ending, honestly this is best one yet."
2611,"It's 10 years of beautiful moments and memories marvel brings to us. Movie is full of emotional moments. Anyway, it's beyond ""film"" it's just life itself."
2612,"7.2/10 👍🍿
I admit, this movie was good. I didn't like infinity War but this was an improvement on both Sadness and characters. Black Widow and Hawkeye were much better in this than any other film!"
2613,"Writing it right out the cinema, the film was an incredible adventure, a must watch for the fans,
But --->spoiler<---- Tony Stark's death killed me inside."
2614,"There probably will be nothing that tops Avengers Endgame at the movie theaters ever again. All signs indicate the movie theater industry is dying. Very few films can open well anymore. I realized after watching Triple Frontier on Netflix at home that honestly, there really is no need to go to a movie theater anymore. My 4K TV that is 55 inches cost $250 at Best Buy. That is the entry level for big screen watching at home now. Buy a projector and you can watch on an even bigger screen for a bit more effort and expense although with roll-up TVs and short-throw projectors getting more popular, entertainment in a box will soon be a very real possibility. And that's not even mentioning cellphones, laptops and tablets.So as for Endgame, sad to say, instead of this Avengers being split into two to tell one cohesive story, unfortunately, the Russos took a more pretentious route and decided to tell two stories instead. It becomes clear after an incredibly dull, and I'm not exaggerating here, hour and a half, the movie finally picks up and gets more interesting. It may take a while for the fanboys to admit it, but this was a really, really subpar movie. I mean, it felt like the Russos made Infinity War as a complete movie, only to have Disney hack off the last thirty minutes to finish it off and tell the Russos they have four hours to write Endgame to make as a separate movie. These guys are definitely talented directors, no doubt, but this was a really, really bad movie motivated by profit-making. It showed. The plot holes are YUGE.I kind of liked where the story went when this movie picked up around the halfway point. The problem is, it could easily have been done in the last movie. If they could make a cut condensing both movies into one and cut out the BS, it would be incredible. I will probably never watch Endgame again, just being honest. It's a bad movie. The beginning almost invalidates everything that happened in Infinity. It just should not have happened, period. It makes Thanos look stupid.And oh yeah Marvel, any reasonably intelligent person can see the end was an out for the stunts pulled in the movie. It was the screenwriter's equivalent of a blank check. In one other pivotal scene, the answer to the dilemma was literally staring the characters in the face but they were too dumb to realize it. Never trust comic books or the movies. Logan pulled a similar stunt too; if you watched the first Wolverine movie, you'd spot the trick they pulled easily too.I couldn't honestly recommend seeing this in theaters. Trust me on this. It felt almost like a cheesy half-baked expansion pack of a videogame."
2615,"Marvel hired some writers to find a way to bring most the casts together. We all knew some would be killed off, the older ones at least while some would survive because their contract said so.The story was rather vague and not much logic, even factoring in all the Marvels techno stuff, and did not impress me much.The final battle? No regular human forces (police, army, marines etc,) were involved? Did Thanos killed them all in the last movie at the snap of his fingers? The time travel logic did not make sense either but I did laugh at the quotes of old time travel movies.The movie will make money but I rather watch Iron Man 1, Thor 1 and Avenger 1 over this. IMO Superman could had killed Thanos without trouble only if the studios would allow it."
2616,"It's impossible to watch a film of this much scale, history, cultural importance, and franchise-carrying characters in a vacuum. No other franchise has the balls, nor the emotional buildup that it carries to justify a 3-hour runtime in a world where those kinds of runtimes are limited to fantasy epics (Lord of the Rings) or old glorious 70 millimeter films (Lawrence of Arabia). I guess that's what best describes Endgame, it is a glorious and grossly satisfying epic, and one that will soon become a classic etched and immortalized in the cultural consciousness of a generation.If there's one thing that Marvel has done properly, its understanding how to do good on their characters. The MCU has thrived because it has consistently followed a philosophy of putting characters first. There is a reason why this movie broke pre-sale records, why there were cheers, tears and rounds of applause from the audience in each shining moment of the film. Endgame takes Marvel's character-driven storytelling to its extreme and most appealing. Infinity War largely proved how Marvel knows how to divide it characters, unite them all with one common threat and theme, and deliver a punch in the gut ending that had fans dusting their tears.At the start of Endgame, fans are at the same emotional headspace as their favorite characters who are at a loss for hope. Right off the bat, the Russo brothers as directors have put themselves in a corner that allowed them to find a creative way out of it. Together with screenplay writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, the story feels more rich, poignant, and satisfying. It goes without saying that you shouldn't go into this film expecting a high-art, indie slow burner, it still flows and feels very much like a Marvel movie, but the difference is that it is more restrained. The film opts for quieter, relaxed, and introspective scenes between characters. Steve, Tony, Clint, Natasha, Thor, and Banner all get their moments to shine, and it's clear that this is the original six's movie if Infinity War was Thanos'.Each fan service moment feels earned, despite it being obviously shameless and pandering, it feels like the Avengers can justify showing off a little especially after 11 years of buildup. Nothing beats the collective gasps and thunderous applause you get from the audience whenever each iconic moment occurs. Endgame is clearly, unapologetically, and triumphantly made for the fans. Each scene, each line of dialogue and each callback is constructed passionately and with care. No arcs in the last 11 years were left forgotten and left in the dust.As an epilogue to the now titled ""Infinity Saga"", this film works best as the season finale of a long running cinematic television epic. If you see it that way, you'll understand the motivations behind the creative decisions that the filmmakers made. Each plot point may feel overused or something you've seen before, but the people behind the scenes know it and even acknowledge it within the film. It doesn't mean they are unmotivated, but rather the opposite, they use it to stunning effect for incredibly emotional payoffs that honestly feels like a miracle that they managed to pull it off.In the end, what more is there to say about this movie? Aside from its consistently stunning visuals, creative cinematography, coherent action set pieces, and kick-ass musical score, this film is all about emotion and getting the catharsis you've always wanted as a fan, a normal moviegoer, or as a little kid. Some people grew up with the MCU, 11 years is a damn long time and I'm definitely part of those who did. I guess this is what those kids in the 70s-80s felt when they saw Star Wars.Verdict: 4.8/5"
2617,"ProsThey didn't do the obvious Captain America sacrifices himself for the cause, while it was always going to be Tony, having Black Widow sacrifice herself was a decent surprise.Fat Thor.Didn't have an over-reliance on Captain Marvel and her powers.ConsPacing just felt really weird and off to me.Having IW-Thanos so easily killed kind of eroded his potential value as a plot point and meant they relied on the really tenuous ""future Nebula mind melds with current Nebula and gives away the plot so strong Thanos can re-appear""Having used Hulk to undo the decimation, having Tony Stark use the power gauntlet solely to decimate Thanos and his forces seems a bit stupid, considering with the Power Gauntlet and as Iron Man he could have easily bested them without a snap - it's a plot holeThe worst plot hole - ""People that were decimated will come back and fit into a society that is five years removed from the one they left and no issues will be caused by that"" - what about people who moved on? What about the lack of food and other factors? It's just lazy horrible writing.The ""Girl Power"" scene - I get it; I get the female cause, I get wanting a Black Captain America to get that Black Panther dollar too - but it's such lazy writing to have them all find each other on a battle field in that particular way.We're to believe Captain America from 1940 goes back to be with Peggy (now in her late forties, early 50s) and lives a life where he watches his friend Bucky get tortured by Hydra, Shield be betrayed by Hydra despite his wife being a director and all the other travesties so he can just ""live his life""The bitter-sweet ""But Tony and Pepper have a kid"" - I think the sacrifice that could and should have been made is for Tony to realise that he has to give away the kid in order to return those that were lost to the decimation; i.e the click undoes the last five years and brings them back to the instant that Thanos clicked.."
2618,"I cannot recall another movie during which my wife fell asleep so may times. Very boring, very long, full of plot holes. You will not enjoy this unless you get excited when you see hundreds of Marvel characters in one shot. And if you are not a total Marvel freak than you will have no idea who they are."
2619,"What a contrast with Avengers: Infinity War. I really enjoyed that one but this one just felt short in every aspect. First of all it was way too long, they could have written this story in half of the time. Three hours is already long for an interesting movie, so you can imagine how painful it gets when it's not that interesting. If I have to be honest I fell asleep a couple of times towards the end, that's how captivating this story was. Maybe one day I will watch it again to see if I missed anything but I have my doubts that I will do that. Not all actors are great actors, but that we already knew from this cast. This kind of movies has to have it from the action scenes and special effects, which this movie just lacked. I think this time we can call it a day and move on to something else. Bye bye avengers!"
2620,"This movie is honestly the Empire Strikes Back of Marvel. A lot of movies aren't nearly as good. Firstly, the CGI, the action, and just the special effects on the heroes, they're top notch. Second, I know that this movie doesn't exactly have the action throughout because of the time travel plot, well there's a quite a bit of action scenes, but it gives us a enjoyable throwback to the old MCU movies and saves the big blockbuster action for the finale and there's nothing to be said of the finale except for one word: EPIC. Lastly, it really put a good use of the 11 year buildup of our heroes. And you really careabout all of them. And everyone does career-best performances. But the star of the show is RDJ. He's always been great as Tony Stark, but I don't think he was as good as he was in this movie. He honestly deserves an Oscar. And don't listen to haters of this movie please. Just watch it and enjoy it."
2621,I am a big fan of Marvel and the Avengers and have seen every movie leading up to Endgame as well as reading the comics and watching the old movies when they were released back in the 90s and early 2000s and in the last 10 years the MCU has created an amazing cinematic world and Endgame is the culmination of all those storys combined for one final showdown between the Avengers and Thanos.Sounds great on paper but that's not how the movie plays out instead of having what's left of the Avengers humanity and all life in the galaxy take a final stand against Thanos and avenge the fallen ultimately uniting a galaxy who have lost everything but overcome incredible loss and a powerful foe to accept what happened and build a new and better world in the name of the lost and in the name of unity.Instead we get Thanos being killed in the first 10 minutes of the movie after he has destroyed the Infinity stones destroying any chance at undoing the damage 5 years pass and the Avengers get together once again to go back in time take the Infinity stones from different points in time in an attempt to snap there fingers and bring back everyone killed by Thanos my issue with this storyline is it makes all the previous movies fights story and character development absolutely pointless if your just gunna erase all the consequences of the previous movies and losing the fight against Thanos in favour of time travel and happy endings that's an insult to anyone who has followed the MCU for the last ten years just to get a tagged on ending so Disney and Marvel can keep making sequels.The movie looks visually amazing with the same great acting from all involved but with a phoned in storyline a full hour and a half of nothing but talking and only one good fight scene in the entire movie this 3 hour movie is only worth watching if you have watched all the other movies in the MCU and you wanna see how it all ends and even then don't get your hopes up for something grand in scale because you will be let down.
2622,"Great movies and great actors with great acting, great editing,
Thank you"
2623,"Once you start watching this movie you do not want to stop. This is just not a movie it is much more than that. One picture says more than 1000 words , so go and see this amazing movie!"
2624,"As a fan that still believes that Iron Man was most definitely the peak Marvel movie, I can't help but feel that this movie is very entertaining plus genuinely touching at the end but also spectacularly full of booming plot holes that DC gets smashed for in their films.Most obvious is that when Tony snaps his fingers, he is technically removing all evil from the films/MCU (as even Marvel couldn't be so daft as to think the finger snap will only target story specific villains).This mean any future villains will be some contrived fiction! Sorry Marvel, but major stuff up in film lore/logic.What was everyone doing during the finale? They bring everyone back, with little reasoning, just because time travel, yet most do little throughout. The gathering of female superheroes was banging, yet resulted in 30 seconds of titular edification. Marvel kicked a huge own goal with this effort. Captain Marvel, who I love the daylights out of, and is without doubt significantly more powerful than Thanos, still takes a beating at the hands of a far lesser being - yet she has the power of the Tesseract flowing through her, and Thanos, with no Infinity Stones attached, just ragdolls her.Probably the most noticable goof is that Peter Parker stays the same age even when he goes back to school, yet Ant-Man's daughter gets older, and Morgan Stark is like 4 years old. This literally couldn't happen as Spider-Man wasn't in the Quantum Realm."
2625,"Watching the coming attractions was depressing. No wonder kids are half brain-dead today. My only interest in anything Avengers is Benedict Cumberbatch. I thought this was a fun film, loved all the cameos and the actors are all very likable. Special effects were amazing, but for about a half hour there I felt like I was watching a video game.Thought the script managed to have some poignancy and humor as well. And you have to see it in a theater."
2626,"Spoilers ahead!Not too much more to say than what's already been said out there on the interwebs. But I just viewed this for the second time and had a few thoughts.Overall: Great story telling, slow build to the big final action sequence, sure there are a few flaws but they are all so easily overlooked. The humor, the heartbreak, heavy and light tones, it's all there. I loved all the references and Easter eggs. There are so many I cought in the second viewing that I missed at first. ""On your left!"". (Even one as simple as T'challa calling Hawkeye ""Clint"" after his, now memed, response to Clint's introducing himself in Civil War, ""I don't care""). Great action sequences throughout, especially at the end, wow!The perfect ending: Upon a second viewing the foreshadowing is there and it's well done. Once Strange holds up the 1 we see it click, we see Tony accept his fate. One huge thing I took from this scene that I missed in my first viewing was a line that Howard Stark told Tony when they were speaking back in 1970. Howard told him a mistake that he's made: ""The greater good rarely outwayed my own self interest"". I have no doubt that Tony thought about that line right before he snapped with the stones to save everything and everyone, at the expense of his own life. As a parent myself the dynamic of saving the world but leaving your family without you really hit me hard and brought tears to my eyes both times I watched. Ultimately this was a great polish up and send off to Tony Stark, we see both his tender side and his heroic side in this final film, well done RDJ!And Cap got his dance. :)Perfect capstone to this saga and an absolute prefect culmination of 10 years of films! ""I love you 3000"""
2627,Idk if this deletes the previous review but I'll try.
2628,Best movi ever tony starn is a legend iron man legend cap legend
2629,"Such a disappointment. Avengers and GOTG upgraded the genre with their last movies. This is is a huge step back. Too long, I literally got bored in the middle. The story makes no sense, the end is predictable. Why kill the good Natasha instead of Hawkeye who was beyond redemption? Why put women on the side in general? I hate the sequence of women united, as if they are only worth it as a set (ticking the box for including women), not as individuals.
The only character that saved movie: The Hulk"
2630,"It is a daunting task to wrap up a magnum opus called The Avengers involving numerous heroes who have become a part of ourselves and engineered permanent seats for themselves in our hearts. It is somewhat successful in its pursuit of providing the conclusion the franchise deserves although I would have been more satisfied if they would not have ventured on the time travel route.Like other time-travel movies , this film also suffers from numerous plot inconsistencies. Time travel is an enigmatic phenomenon not only for laymen but for scientists as well. Hence, it is bound to create issues when integrated into a film.The film's treatment of Thanos is an utter disappointment. He has been reduced from a stoic visionary to a shallow formulaic ruthless villain completely disrespecting his massive character development in Infinity war. Hulk was yet another low point of the film. I believed firmly that Hulk was going to take a major role against Thanos in EndGame but instead we get 'Professor Hulk' who did not go bonkers even over Natasha's death. Thor who is aware of personal losses suddenly decides to become a despondent loner. Let us not forget that his mother, brother, his men were all snatched from him but he never strayed from the path of retribution. This was a major disservice done to his character arc.Natasha's death does not qualify to be a sacrifice as Clint was insistent on saving her from falling to her death and negates the Vormir events in Infinty war. Ironman was given a martyr's death just because his contract has expired. Instead he should have taken up the role of mentor for New Avengers and made occasional appearances. ""God's righteous man- a man out of time"" Captain America succumbed to his desire for getting a normal life which is not digestible for a Cap fan. He should have died a valiant death and that would have given an honorable and befitting end to the life of such an amazing magnanimous persona. Unforgivable disservice was done to his character given the fact that he left the New Avengers in the lurch with 2 down, 1 retired and one severely injured.Dr. Strange's entire plan was based on the mere chance that a rat presses the keys securing Antman's escape from Quantum realm. Thus, the plot faltered right from the word 'Go'.The war sequence was well-made but too many heroes at some points made it incoherent at times. A bit of daylight would have sufficed as in earlier Avengers movies.Endgame gives us a scenario of a post-apocalyptic world and the principal cast have given their best marvel performances till date depicting their trauma, their agony and their desperation. The lengthy first half sets this up very well and creates a profound impact on the audience. CGI was top notch as usual. The background score blended well with the different moods. References to previous movies really moved me.Overall, the film does have its moments in both halves but can't dethrone Winter Soldier, Infinity war, Civil war as three of my personal MCU favorites because of their atypical superhero movie plots which stands out from the rest."
2631,Great film! Loved it! Robert Downey Jr. was absolutely fantastic! Brilliant actor!
2632,"I saw Avengers Endgame and it was incredible I absolutely loved it. The only blemish on this otherwise perfect movie is Captian Marvel she is the most *obnoxious* characters I have ever seen in my entire life. Annoying, Stone cold, smug, unsimpathic, ridiculously overpowered when Thanos punches he she just takes it WHAT THE ACTUAL H**L. All the other characters can barely land a punch. She flies through Thanos' ship like it is cardboard. She is a very unnecessary charcater. What bugged me the most is that when all the other Avengers were depressed even poor Thor was trying to drink his troubles away. Then this sarcastic a**hole comes in completely insensitive to them. What is wrong with you! Horrible Horrible Charcater. It reminds me of the Spongebob episode *Artist Unknown*. Squidward was the art teacher. Spongebob came in and was perfect at everything while barely trying. Only that was annoying for comedy purposes this is annoying for bad writting purposes."
2633,"Whenever a movie plot has to rely on time travel as a way to fix things, it usually means that the writers ""painted themselves into a corner"" and don't know how to get out of it. When done well such as in ""Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home"" (1986), the time travel gimmick can work wonders. In the original ""Back to the Future"" (1985) the time travel gimmick worked very well, but in subsequent versions of the ""Back to the Future"" franchise the time travel gimmick got old and hokey. In the latest, the fourth and final installment in the Avengers franchise ""Endgame"", we all saw it coming, time travel had to be the way to make things right in the universe again at least in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.Like a couple of the other user reviews here, the more I thought about ""Avengers: Endgame"" Directed by Anthony and Joe Russo, the more disappointed in the film I became. Last year's ""Avengers: Infinity War"" was the best. This film did not even come close. I am sorry. I really wanted to enjoy this movie enough to happily recommended it. It was the most highly anticipated film of the year. The first hour of the movie dragged so much that I felt it was unnecessary and added nothing to the film but made it an hour longer.I have a question, why was Captain Marvel even in the film? If Tony Stark is to die at the end of the film, then he should have died in space at the beginning of the film. Just saying. There were many other directions the time travel plot could have gone that would have made this movie work better. There were many bothersome points in this film. Aside from Rocket who initially survived Thanos's finger snap the other Guardians of the Galaxy were irrelevant especially if Gamora at the end of the film was not the Gamora that had to give her life for the soul stone in ""Infinity War"". I guess we will see how this all turns out in the next Guardians of the Galaxy. I wonder if Yondu Udonta who died in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" will show up somewhere unless of course, he died before the finger snap in ""Infinity War"". I also wonder what happened to Dead Pool and the rest of the X-Men. Oh, I guess they are way on the other side of the MCU.We all know, time travel or not, that the infinity stone that Dr. Strange had in his possession was the key to how the universe is saved. That stone, however, had to be retrieved to restore the universe back to the way it was. That is one of the many plot holes that the whole time travel gimmick left for us.Now for the things I disagreed and agreed with. It was nice to get most of the Avengers back. However, I was not pleased with the loss of the Black Widow. Especially after investing a whole hour with her doing her best to hold things together. It seems to me that she would have made it back after Iron-man's finger snap that erased Thanos and his army from the universe. I don't even want to go into Steve Rogers going back in time to be with his beloved. I like the Tony and Pepper Potts had a child. It showed a softer side of Tony Stark. A beautiful daughter to carry on his legacy. And speaking of legacy it was nice to see Stan Lee's cameo once again.If you have three hours to spare then go watch the whole movie. If you only have an hour and a half and if you time it right, you can watch the best that ""Avengers: Endgame"" has to offer. If you really want to see a good time travel movie, then watch H.G. Wells' ""The Time Machine"" (1960) starring Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux directed by George Pal. ""The Time Machine"" won an Oscar for photography."
2634,"I'm not going to complain about the time travel inconsistencies of a fictional movie - I actually enjoyed the film, but there are a few things about it that are just fundamentally poor taste.
Since few will read this entire review I'm going to start with the single reason why this movie is a five and not an eight:
If I were Chris Hemsworth I would hit one Russo brother with Mjolnir and the other brother with Stormbreaker. What a disservice to both Hemsworth and the incredible character he gave all of us. Ok, start him out fat, get some laughs, move on. If his lightning can braid his beard it can strip off a few pounds too. Now my last memory of Thor as an Avenger is the atrocity of Beachbum Avenger Thor. I will never understand how this was allowed to happen.
Give me one good reason, other than the obvious pandering, why CA gave his shield to Sam when Bucky, who is basically the same as CA, is standing right there. To top that, they've been lifelong friends and can't be bothered to say goodbye?
Same type of pandering and for the same type of obvious reason, the all female team assembled to protect CM - really? As if she needs anyone after destroying an entire ship by flying through it. This may not have irritated me so much if Brie Larson were a better CM AND if she hadn't said all of the ridiculous accusations she's been spouting lately. We didn't hear anything about a problem with white males when she was trying to become a star did we? I thought I might be being a little harsh until my wife brought up her annoyance about the same thing.
The show is worth seeing if you can handle the disappointment they delivered to us with some of their decisions. I always thought when it came to the movie side of Marvel that Stan Lee was just a front man. Now with the lack of quality present in both movies since his passing, I'm starting to wonder."
2635,Infinity war had a massive build up and then the disappearance happened. In this they defeat Thanos in 2 minutes like he's nothing? I know he doesn't have the stones but he's still powerful. Then the rest of the film is about time travelling which felt like a cross between interstellar and The Leftovers. There wasn't really any great action scenes. The ready player one type battle at the end was good but apart from that a lot of the scenes were rehashings of old movies. I know there going back in time but I still wanted to see something original and new. It just didn't blow your mind like Infinity War. There's a lot of sob story to it. Very corny too and at 3 hours long it is exhausting. Also one of the least funniest marvel films. The one liners were lame and some fell flat. Basically Infinity War set a bar and this didn't match it. RIP Stan Lee.
2636,"It could definitely be improved, but every possible flaw can be totally overlooked because of the 22 film build-up, it seems earned completely for every joke that doesn't land (which isn't many) there are a hundred fan-service moments that make you forget any wrongdoing
Following up such an airtight film like Infinity War would be superbly difficult, making the 11 years feel worth it is an achievement and The Russo Brothers deserve praise."
2637,"I went to the cinema today to see this movie. I didn't want to wait for the dvd release. In my opinion Infinity War had some great moments and the ending was beautiful in its own way. I expected a movie as good as Infinity War or even better because of the many positive reviews. What I liked about this movie was that I couldn't predict the things that happened in the movie. But they didn't surprise me either. The time traveling stuff was interesting but not very overwhelming. The ending wasn't nearly as good as some people (including RDJ) were saying. All in all, I think that I should have waited for the DVD."
2638,"I admit I had fairly high expectations for this movie, but in this instance I find it justified given the buildup to this particular movie.To put it shortly, it is inferior to Infinity War in every way. I've seen infinity war probably 8 times now and Endgame makes me appreciate it even more. The pacing and execution of Infinity War is incredible in comparison. Infinity war felt like a much more mature movie in that there are moments that still make me feel sadness for the characters and the pacing of the movie was far better. Endgame felt all over the place. There were moments I wanted to tear up but the scenes didn't feel adequate to really draw a reaction. They moved on far too quickly and the movie itself was choppy. It was hard to really relate to the characters. When I first saw Infinity War I wondered how they would handle so many characters in one film and be able to still have the audience empathize with them, but any doubts were laid to rest. This movie is pretty much the worst case scenario for how to handle many characters.Don't get me wrong, there were parts that were quite satisfying, which is hard to go into further detail about without divulging too much information.All in all this movie was saved by particular scenes and those few moments of feeling resolution. It felt more childish in execution and appeal and Infinity War felt more mature than the typical Marvel movie. When I saw Captain Marvel I really disliked it, but I thought it was a one off and they would be redeemed with Endgame. This was not the case.Definitely see it, and see it in theatres if you can, just don't go in with the highest of expectations."
2639,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews. Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
2640,"Well,Full of flaws and unanswered questions1-Captain America using Thor's hammer ? And wow, lightening too ? Hmmmm
2-are we going that cheap funny to make Thor like this ? Seriously ?
3-timeline ting full of weird stuff, the least of them when young nebula dies , the existing one should vanish
4-the cartoon look of hulk , cant they do better with all the young characters and older ones they create amazingly
5-what was the next step of Luke since he took the teseract ?
6-Whats with the roles of dr.strange , Spider-Man and star-lord ? It's like they were just brought to be in the movie
7-change of course because the Hulk took the stairs ? Really ?
8-so if it wasn't for the rat that got ant-man out of the quantum realm there wouldn't be a story ? Hmmmm, quite convincingSeriously, the movie is a disappointment"
2641,Pretty good but I wished for more. More movies with just one super hero
2642,"I've watched the movie at the fan night first show all hyped up and wearing my quantum suite hoodie and came out of the movie with mixed feelings and confusion and here's why so ,
The first reason is actually a question I've asked myself while heading home from the movie , Is it really a new era that the superheroes must die at the end of their acting contract ! Is it how will it be from now on ! That might be a kiddish question that goes into a kid watching a movie of his favorite superhero and he's getting killed or die at the end of this movie , but who we are but kids within ourselves while watching these movies ! First time I hate watching a superhero movie was when Zach Sanders decided to kill superman at the end of "" Batman Vs Superman "" even that he gave a little hint by raising the dust over his coffin and also brought him back in the "" justice league"" movie but I did get out of that movie heart broken , the kid inside me was crying , save the world but don't die ! It's not trading lives ! A hero can die fighting for his heroic action with honor and respect but superhero for me is the one who can fight and win and keep going in his heroic action , he is meant to live within each one of us , I don't go to watch superhero movie to see him at the end of the movie ! Even to save the universe ! Or to save the day ! They also killed Logan at the end of his solo movie ! And now tony Stark ! So what's the point of becoming a superhero movie fan , follow a favorite superhero and then watch him die at the end of his contract just because the director decided so or the actor himself wanted no other to take his role ! What a disappointing feeling is that ! And can that be satisfying to any superhero fan ! If that's how the franchises are going to embrace from now and on then goodbye to the imaginary worlds we all loved and enjoyed .
I didn't say too much about the movie but I can summarize the huge amount of feelings I had after it in one word "" disappointing "" ."
2643,"No need for a long article. There wasn't enough action, drama and comedy. A mediocre final movie"
2644,"Avengers: Endgame is probably the most hyped and the most anticipated release of 2019. Marvel's Avengers that has continued to entertain and wow us for so many years has finally come to a conclusion that has all the World held in its thrall.In the previous movie, Avengers: Infinity War, we saw Thanos erasing half the population including many of our favorite Avengers from the planet and in this film, the world is still trying to grapple with the loss. I will not reveal the plot but suffice to say that the story while a bit slow in the first half had me glued to my seat throughout. The twists and turns are so well planned that nowhere did they seem predictable and lest you breathe or break concentration, you will find yourself missing the many memorable moments in Avengers: Endgame.Everyone right from the Avengers to the supporting characters from previous movies of the Avengers franchise make an appearance here and what an appearance it is! You will feel like reuniting with family after many years of separation and left with a heart full of a myriad of emotions- happiness at meeting them again, sadness at knowing that this will be the last time we meet them and satisfaction that many of our beloved characters get their happily-ever-after.Avengers: Endgame is a movie well planned and expertly executed. The joy of having all my beloved heroes and heroines at one place is beyond words and the feeling of loss knowing I will never see them again together is heart-wrenchingly real. Stan Lee's last cameo of his life and the last in an Avenger's movie was so beautiful that it brought a smile to my face as well as sadness to my heart.I stayed off social media lest I accidentally read a spoiler until I watched the movie!
A movie that not only wraps up the Avengers chapter beautifully but also justifies each second of the three hour-long story, Njkinny recommends Avengers: Endgame to everyone. Go watch with friends, family or alone. Don't miss out on the unforgettable feeling of seeing an exceptional saga of heroism, friendship, love, and sacrifice come to a memorable conclusion in this film.Super shiny 5 stars to it from me and this is a movie that I can watch again."
2645,Nice movie.Great cgi work and the performance of all the superheros was great.
2646,A movie worth watching. If you have a busy schedule them too give 3 hours for this movie.
2647,"I'm not a fan of the MCU, but I saw all the movies to understand this one and maybe because this type of films are not my type, but every time I analyze the plot of Endgame I like it less because it literally doesn't make any sense.Time travel is one of the most important things to take care of and explained so that the story makes sense, this movie simply tells you 'don't worry about how it works because we will do what we want' that is to say it is used as a resource for make fanservice (I don't dislike it) but it affects the consistency of the plot and the development point of the characters in the previous movies.The Characters; Thor is a character with a clear arc that for some reason they decide to destroy it and use it as a comic relief when he is a very strong character who falls into depression because he has lost everything and apparently that is funny? The sacrifice of Natasha when she began to have a development away from her romance and that apparently being sterile turns a woman into a monster... it feels like a punishment, for which she must pay for what she did because it's treated like she wasn't important, she don't even has a funeral and of course, she deserved be in the final battle. Capitan America arc is about don't given up and accepting what happened to him but he decides gives up and return to the past (I don't know how the Cap that stays in past creating an alternative timeline in a parallel universe appears in the this same timeline but old). The female characters are insignificant or are used as resources so that ""feminist"" scene isn't feminist at all because of how weakly and badly these characters are developed; Captain Marvel is a resource, the deux ex machina that with a solo film that connects her emotionally to the earth and some characters in a interesting way they have been unable to put any reference and show that she is an independent character with a life beyond this event so you don't see her as a real person and she feels off, wasted (love her hairstyle and her new suit, btw); Valkyrie has a minimum of development in thor 3 but not enough to be named queen of Asgard; Nebula is a tortured character that Marvel still doesn't recognize her trauma and how horrible it must be to face her past self and kill her past self for her sister... could be hours talking about the characters and how wrong they made them.The final battle is spectacular and a tribute but I honestly can not understand how a character like Thanos is stronger without the infinity gauntlet than with it or his version of the past without the experience and determination that is achieved with character development and it's feels like is another villain that in IW. When at first they go to find Thanos, this is a character who has sacrificed everything for what he believes is right and as he has fulfilled his goal and has made the world a better place he has no motivation to continue living or fighting. The Thanos of the past is ambitious, not only believes that he is right but it is his destiny, maybe because it is a younger version but in my opinion it breaks the evolution and emotional charge of the villain as well as it happens with confrontation with the heroes since for the heroes the struggle with him is personal for all that he has taken from them but for Thanos it is personal because the heroes frustrate what is his destiny turning into a more cruel version motivated by a sense of entitlement taking away his sense of purpose and objective that the end justifies the means and he's the only one who has what it takes to accomplish this task because he is the only willing to make personal sacrifice for the greater good as opposed to the heroes who are unable to understand it and accept the sacrifice instead oppose it in a way that for Thanos is selfish.That affects the emotional charge in my opinion in the final battle and the development of Thanos, when they involute his development is no longer that well-developed villain that although you may not agree on his methods but his goal is reasonable, This new version of him is caricatured as the bad one simplifying things. The devastating response to Scarlet Witch in the battle when she is facing him for everything that he took away from her and he simply says ""I don't know you"" is the most significant example I can give that the Thanos change affects the emotional charge of the film and the great character that was Thanos in IWI understand that this movie is a closing of an era and a tribute, which for certain moments because the emotion of the end especially with Iron Man, the spectacularity of the final battle, when they believe that everything is lost and those that were missing appear to fight, the team up of the MCU women and all the teamwork to beat Thanos is the best that made me not give much importance to the script and plot problems but when I think about it I can not help but feel that this movie is spectacular, and emotional but also incoherent and a tremendous mess."
